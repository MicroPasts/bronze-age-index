The three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham, hoard are similar in form, size and weight to the Salthouse bead (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts (including bronze palstaves) that allow it to be dated to c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid.). The bead is also similar to those from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire and Harlow, Essex, the former from a stratified Middle Bronze Age context (Varndell 2000, 12, no.1; 2005/6, 17, 270, no.6), and Buriton, Hampshire (HAMP-72E451).\n\n\n\nMiddle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. forthcoming) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).\n\n\n\nThe age and precious metal content of this item qualify it as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Andrew Rogerson","datefound1":"December 12, 2012","datefound2":"December 12, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Andrew Rogerson","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"10.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Salthouse","county":"Norfolk","district":"North Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edarch/44081_AEC678_BA_Bead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"6.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
