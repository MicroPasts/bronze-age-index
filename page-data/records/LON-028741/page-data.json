This is a circular band of gold with parallel sides and stamped and incised decoration. There is no visible seam. The decoration comprises an irregular line of dots running along the midline of this band; the dots have been stamped through from the reverse. There is an incised line running both above and below the line of dots forming borders. The shape of the band is distorted and irregular.\n\n\n\nDimensions: height: 4.4mm; thickness: 0.3mm; diameter: 25mm; weight: 1.41g.\n\n\n\nMetal composition: Analysis by Dr Harriet White (British Museum) established that the precious metal content is more than 10% and the composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date: \"Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the decorated band from London, indicated a surface composition of approximately 85-86% gold, 13-14% silver, and less than 1% copper. The decorated band weighs 1.42 g.\" (Department of Scientific Research, British Museum, File No. 7643-2 2015 T941, 20th January 2017)\n\n\n\nDiscussion: No exact parallel is known for this object but the decoration of goldwork with dot and incised line decoration is a known feature of (Early) Bronze Age goldwork (e.g. Taylor 1970) and the metal composition does not disagree with a Bronze Age date. The function of the object is unclear but it is unlikely to have been a finger ring and is more likely to have been a fitting, perhaps comparable to dagger hilt bands of this period, although these differ in form and decoration from this find.\n\n\n\nKate Sumnall, Finds Liaison Officer for Greater London, 17.02.16.\n\n\n\nEdits: Neil Wilkin,The British Museum Harriet White (metal composition), The British Museum, 27.01.17","fourFigureLat":"51.46040223","fourFigureLon":"-0.21650964","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-800","notes":"As the finger ring is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% gold it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Kate Sumnall","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Kate Sumnall","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"4.4","diameter":"25","edge":null,"thickness":"0.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thamesfield","county":"Greater London Authority","district":"Wandsworth","regionName":"London","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ksumnall/AuBandLON028741.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of London","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
