Length: 92.5mm, Width: 90mm, Thickness: c. 32mm.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThese ingot fragments probably belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, dating to c.1000-800 BC. Both fragments are plano-convex, being rounded on one side and flat on the other. Ingots such as these were cast in a dish-shaped mould, and are often referred to as 'bun' ingots due to their shape. Ingots of raw metal were transported and traded throughout Britain and Europe during the Late Bronze Age. They were frequently broken up into fragments, ready to be smelted to make a range of bronze weaponry, tools and ornaments. Ingots (and ingot fragments) are a regular feature of LBA hoard deposits in southern England (cf. Turner 2010, 86-7). Numerous plano-convex ingot fragments have been recovered in Devon and the surrounding regions (e.g. Powell 2005a; 2005b), most notably the copper and tin ingots recovered from a probable shipwreck site off the coast of Salcombe (Roberts & Veysey 2011; Needham et al. forthcoming). Scientific analysis is currently being undertaken on the Salcombe finds at the British Museum (B. Roberts pers comm.). The Paignton finds are therefore significant for their potential (subject to future analysis) to reveal information regarding patterns of trade and exchange in the Late Bronze Age period in South-West of Britain.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nAs these two Late Bronze Age ingots were found within 1.5m of each other, they are most likely to originate from a single deposit, which has been dispersed. This material is eligible as Treasure under the Treasure Order (2002), as it is a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nNeedham, S., Parham, D. and Frieman, C.
