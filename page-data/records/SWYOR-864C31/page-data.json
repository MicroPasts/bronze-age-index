Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'. The blade is a narrow leaf shape and has a raised triangular rib running down each side, extending on to the socket. The socket tapers outwards from the base of the blade. On each side of the socket is a small raised loop of thin metal, one loop being broken. The sides of the blade flanges also continue onto the socket, forming slight ribs along the sides of the socket, which expand into the loops. The side loops are placed in the centre of the area between the end of the socket and the base of the blade. They are unusually small. The spearhead has a dark brown glossy patina which has flaked off in vulnerable places and light green metal, and some bare bronze is visible. There is a small area of active corrosion. It is 122.6mm long, 16.4mm wide, and 13.3mm thick. It weighs 38.65gm. It probably dates from 1500 BC - 1150 BC. It is a similar shape and size to HAMP-9AF332 and LANCUM-7609C0 but narrower.","fourFigureLat":"54.035173","fourFigureLon":"-1.558716","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"April 19, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nidd","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 628 spear head.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"122.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
