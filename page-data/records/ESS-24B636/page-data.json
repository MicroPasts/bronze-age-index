The axe has a rectangular body which flares out at the blade end, resulting in concave sides with a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is extremely damaged, making it irregularly shaped. In profile, the axe is an elongated lozenge shape, the thickest point being at a slightly raised stop ride. Most of the original surface of the axe has been removed, leaving a pitted surface. Where the original surface survives, it has a dark green patina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is 65.95mm long, 17.56mm wide and 3.18mm thick at the butt end, 18.68mm wide 9.62mm thick at the stop ridge and 29.67mm wide 4.30mm thick at the blade. It weighs 66.14 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.949799","fourFigureLon":"0.937965","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura McLean","datefound1":"September 18, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura McLean","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Langham","county":"Norfolk","district":"North Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lmclean/ESS-24B636.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"65.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
