The spearhead is represented by the socket only and none of the blade survives, making a typological classification difficult. The socket tapers gradually to the break. The two side loops (c. 19. x 6 mm) are low and flat with a roughly lozenge-shaped plate. Casting seams are clear on both sides below the loops, and have been neatly finished by filing. The striations from the filing survive around the loops. The base of the spearhead is slightly thinner, with a gentle step 5mm from the base. The casting seams have been removed before the step. The surface of the fragment has survived well with a dark brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.003565","fourFigureLon":"-2.452997","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1100","notes":"The low, flat nature of the side loops indicate this was probably part of Davis' (2012) Group 6 (developed side-looped spearhead), which dates to the Taunton-Penard phases as defined by Needham et al. (1997). However, similar side loops can be observed on earlier spearheads dating to the preceding Acton Park 2 phase (c.1600-1400 BC), which are defined instead by the blade shape so exact dating is not possible.\n\n\n\nThis spearhead socket was not recorded by Davis (2012).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dymock","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Forest of Dean","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2319.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"55.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
