Sub-circular mouth with double mouth moulding, with a small perforation just below the moulding on one side. It is unclear if the latter is a result of miscasting or damage. Considerable casting flash survives along most of the length of both sides and on the loop, but it has mostly been removed towards the blade. The blade is not widely expanded and the blade tip is missing on one side. There are many very fine transverse lines close to the blade edge. The surviving blade edge is heavily corrosion chipped. Dark green patina with some damage to surface, probably from plough. Forms part of a hoard of Late Bronze Age metalwork, probably deposited circa 1000 to 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.226893","fourFigureLon":"0.705451","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Lenham Station Hoard no.1","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Richardson","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Richardson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"40.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lenham","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/arichardson/KENT-8CF725a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"102.11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
