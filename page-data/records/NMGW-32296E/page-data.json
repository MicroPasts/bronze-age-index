The axe has broken in antiquity across one face and through the base of the socket on the other face. The socket is rectangular (33.4mm wide). The sides appear to be straight and gradually divergent to the blade edge. Corrosion has removed any casting seam on the sides. The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded (with a width of 42.0mm) but is near-straight and shallow (with a surviving depth of 5mm). The blade faces are slightly convex across their widths but near-flat across the length of the more complete face. There is no surviving evidence for ribs on the face but the surface is very heavily corroded. Traces of a mid to dark green patina are evident but much of the surface has a pale-green active corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork. The straight shallow blade is consistent with axes of South Wales (Stogursey) type but should not discount other possible types","fourFigureLat":"51.51513902","fourFigureLon":"-3.73076327","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cornelly","county":"Bridgend","district":"Bridgend","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20184axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"42.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
