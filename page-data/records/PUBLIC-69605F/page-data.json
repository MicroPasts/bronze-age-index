In side view it is 'V' shaped and the casting seam is visible on both concave sides. The seam is closer to one face than the other.\n\n\n\nAt the broken end of the axehead are the remains of a socket 18.2mm long, 2.5mm wide and 1.8mm deep. The break is irregular and old but not particularly worn.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-green, glossy patina. The axehead is 49.1mm wide at the blade end, 29.5mm wide at the socket end, 43.3mm long and 11.7mm thick.
