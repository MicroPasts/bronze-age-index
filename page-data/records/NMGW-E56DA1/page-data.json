The axe has a poorly shaped and heavy double mouth moulding and a loop extends from its underside.  Three slightly divergent longitudinal ribs extend from mouth moulding on each face, although they are only porrly defined on one face.  External mouth shape is irregular subrectangular to ovoid, whilst the internal shape is square.  Evidence of four runners on mouth top: two projecting and two negative scars (the latter impossible to measure accurately).  The sides of the axe are markedly concave and divergent, giving the axe a flared character with rewidening and recurving of the sides towards the blade surface. The axe has a rectangular section with a blocky shape and angled sides.  Prominent casting flashes only coarsely trimmed.  Minor casting flaw beneath the mouth moulding as witnessed by a small hole in the wall of the axe (1.5mm diameter).  Single dent towards the blade end on one surface, created in antiquity by a blunt impact.  Straiations parallel to blade edge indiacte sharpening as does marked convexity of blade edge.  Nicks in blade edge may be effect of corrosion rather than evidence of use wear.  Green and grey patination with some green carbonate encrustation.  No black patination visible.","fourFigureLat":"51.47427","fourFigureLon":"-3.426831","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"121.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
