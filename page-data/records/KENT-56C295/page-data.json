It is  unlooped with high, curved flanges (max. H. 28.2mmmm), fused to the stop  ridge. The width at the butt is 23.4mm. The  flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum  height of c. 12.6mm above the septum  (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge). The stop ridge is stands c. 8mm  above the septum. There is a shield shaped molding beyond the stop  ridge, and fused to it, on both faces (c. 19.5 by 18.0mm). This is  bisected by a molding ridge (seam) running the length of the blade on  both faces; this starts on the lower blade and  terminates before the stop. There are then four parallel ridges decorating the septum near the stop but corrosion obscures where they terminate. There are further longitudinal ridges (casting seams) central  on the sides; these have been finished by trimming the casting flash and  hammering. The blade is 57.5mm across.  The object has suffered heavy corrosion. Where it survives the patina  is dark brown; the metal is generally a mid-brown color. Spread all over the palstave are aqua colored  concretions possibly  from deposition in water.\n\n\nIn total  it is 15.7mm long, 57.7mm wide, 28.2mm thick and weighs 450 grams.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"\nThe palstave was discovered by the finder in a collection of possessions belonging to his father, Sidney Nicholls, who was a local Archaeologist. The exact find spot for the palstave is not know.\n\n\nhttp://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axe: The term palstave is very misleading as it comes from the Icelandic  'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool not a type of axe. However the term is  used in British archeology to describe where there is a stop  and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker  below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and as time went  on developed loops.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jennifer Jackson","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jennifer Jackson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Kent","district":"","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jjackson/KENT-56C295c.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"150.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
