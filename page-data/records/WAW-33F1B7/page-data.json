The blade edge is abraded, and slightly blunt where complete. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical probably occurring due to use not corrosion. Both faces of the blade are decorated with a trident motif whose single ridge which tapers towards the cutting edge. The sides of the blade are triangular with a casting seam which has been smoothed, but still forms a slight ridge. On one side face, at the junction of the blade and septum there is an integral loop.\n\n\n\nThe sides of the septum have a more prominent cast seam ridge, and the sides taper towards the butt of the palstave. There is a deep stop on both faces of the septum with a flange running down the sides on each face. The flanges on the side view taper in depth towards the butt. The butt is a slightly broken edge and obliquely angled therefore, but the break is not too recent. The floor of the rib-stop is corroded, on both side, which does not match the patina covering the remaining surface of the palstave.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has an incomplete well-developed shiny blue-green coloured patina.\n\n\n\nThe palstave measures 142.15mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.90mm wide from blade tip to blade tip, and 30.26mm thick across the stops. It weighs 370g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is similar to Figure 22, No. 166 in Savoury (1980). The palstave is an early/primary Group III example which dates to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to c. 1500-1300 BC.\n\n\n\nSavory, H.N. 1980 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections National Museum of Wales: Cardiff","fourFigureLat":"52.31886619","fourFigureLon":"-2.23615162","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"\nThe landowners are very kindly donating the palstave to Museums Worcestershire.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2018","datefound2":"December 05, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.26","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hartlebury","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW33F1B7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"142.15"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
