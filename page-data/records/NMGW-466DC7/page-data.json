The axe has a prominent mouth moulding, the top of which is heavily eroded, removing any trace of runner stubs. Three converging ribs descend from the mouth moulding. The width and contours of the face suggest the axe was slender with a sub-rectangular section with rounded corners. None of the loop or casting seams survives. The fragment has worn edges with light green patches of corrosion. The fragment surfaces have a green patination except between the ribs, where the surface is black.","fourFigureLat":"51.509691","fourFigureLon":"-3.471168","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"This is a ribbed socketed axe belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age and dating to between 1000 and 800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Though not certainly diagnostic to type, this fragment exhibits features consistent with a South Wales type socketed axe: the prominent mouth moulding, the three face ribs and the sub-rectangular cross-section. South Wales type axes were commonly made and used in south east Wales at this time (McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980; Needham 1981). Over 30 hoards containing at least 140 examples are known from south east Wales (e.g. Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. However, they were also made and used across south western and central southern England, with a few examples circulating as far as northern Britain, Ireland and northern France.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Adam Gwilt","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/B F ax.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums and Galleries of Wales","length":"30.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
