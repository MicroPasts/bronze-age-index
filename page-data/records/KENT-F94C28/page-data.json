Both ends terminate in rough breaks and the walls are veyr thick. On one side there is an overlap likely some fault in the casting or vagaries of production. It has a heavily patinated and pitted surface which obscure more detail. It remains a mottled light green to turquoise colour.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 58.75mm long, 16.25mm in diameter at widest (13,5 at narrower end) and 35.41g in weight.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The exact identity of this object remains uncertain due to its completeness and wear. It resembles both the socket of bronze age spears e.g. OXON-0CE8E2, SOM-71B58D etc. and ferrules dated form the bronze age to Roman period e.g. HAMP-A36D91, LANCUM-BF58B9 etc.","fourFigureLat":"51.22742842","fourFigureLon":"1.04927733","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.25","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Petham","county":"Kent","district":"Canterbury","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTF94C28.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"58.75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
