The object is in fair condition and weighs 7.61g. It consists of a circular-sectioned shaft which tapers slightly and has a blade emerging from each side. These and the tip are damaged, so the full shape cannot be identified. The object is probably part of a leaf shaped spearhead, dating to the Penard and Ewart Park phases (Middle to Late Bronze Age).","fourFigureLat":"52.409415","fourFigureLon":"-0.575432","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lowick","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"East Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/29F110.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
