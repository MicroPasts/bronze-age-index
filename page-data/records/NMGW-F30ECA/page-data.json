Needham’s Class 4E (Type Whittington) relates to Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 65)[1] and probably dating to Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V), the later part of Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, c. 1900 – 1600BC.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is near-complete, missing only the cutting edge of the blade, the blade tips and part of the butt. There is no decoration visible on any of the axe’s surface. The axe has a lozenge profile with a stop ridge, a damaged straight butt and near-straight, gently diverging sides. The sides only start to diverge more strongly until well below the stop ridge, at which point they flare strongly to produce a heavily expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 64.2mm). The curvature of the sides and the quite strongly curved blade edge is slightly asymmetric, with one of the blade tips more expanded than the other. \n\n\n\nThe sides of the axe are convex and undecorated- the flanges stand upright and are not beveled inwards compared to the septum; the flanges stand a maximum of c. 2mm above the septum. The sides are smooth where the original surface remains- any trace of casting flash has been carefully removed. The stop bevel is straight and subtle (with a maximum thickness of 11.2mm excluding the flanges). \n\n\n\nThe axe has undergone chemical degradation but is still in relatively good condition. The majority of the original surface remains, with a dark brown patina. The original surface is smooth and even glossy in some patches, preserving some toolmarks including sharpening striations on the blade. There are patches of rust-coloured corrosion product on the original surface. Degradation has led to the delamination of the original surface, which has likely lost much of its copper content and is in a fragile state. This has led to the loss of areas of surface, revealing a light grey powdery core underneath. Cracks in the original surface suggest that this delamination is affecting much of the object. Areas where the surface has been lost entirely include one corner of the butt and a section of adjoining side, parts of the flanges, and one blade tip as well as the entire blade edge.\n\n\n\nThis axe clearly fits into Needham’s Class 4E (Type Whittington)/Type Bandon: it is comparatively small with a straight butt, a clear stop ridge, straight and near-parallel sides producing a narrow mid-blade, below which it curves sharply to form expanded blade tips.\n\n\n\n\n\nLength: 109.6mm\n\n\n\nWidth: 64.2mm\n\n\n\nThickness: 14mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 185.54g","fourFigureLat":"51.60995743","fourFigureLon":"-3.35887263","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1600","notes":"[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
