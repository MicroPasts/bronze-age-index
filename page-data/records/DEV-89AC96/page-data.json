These items were considered under the Treasure Act (1996). Please see the Treasure report below for further details.\n\n\nA Middle Bronze Age base-metal group from Ottery St Mary, Devon Treasure case: 2006 T36. Three objects of prehistoric bronze metalwork were found dispersed over a small area measuring approximately 15 x 10m. In addition, a further artefact was discovered in an adjoining field and was reported as part of this potential treasure case.\n\n\n1. Looped palstave, fragment. Complete blade with part of loop. The blade expands progressively towards the convex cutting edge. Defined edge bevels on both faces, 11-12.2mm from current cutting edge. Broad central single rib on either face. The loop is incomplete, areas of the flange are missing close to the junction with the blade and the end of the butt is damaged. The blade edge is corrosion damaged and there is a small, semi-circular piece missing from the centre of the blade edge. The lower blade is slightly pocked and has patches of pale green corrosion. Mid-green, dull patina. L: 90.6mm; W. blade edge: 58.7mm; Wt: 263.9g.\n\n\n2. Looped palstave, fragment. Butt end, joins with no.1, above. Trace of looped handle. Casting flashes removed. Dull dark grown patina with patches of iron corrosion and a white concretion inside the flange on one side. Incomplete at butt end and corrosion-reduced flange crests. L: 63.65mm; W: 24.95mm; L. septum: 56.8mm; D. flanges: 35.95mm; Wt: 94.3g. Flange sides are short and would originally have been petal-shaped with a flat edge level with the butt.\n\n\n3. Casting jet, copper-alloy. In plan, at the top it is sub-lenticular with one pointed end and the other slightly distorted and with a rounded extension. Casting seams on two sides. There is an oblong 'scar' left from the runner (18.4mm long and 6.35mm wide). Upper surface has a constriction on surface and a slight concavity with a copper-alloy concretion at the centre. Dull, dark almost black patina, with small patches of green, copper alloy corrosion. L: 41mm; W: 27.5mm; Th: 22.48mm; Wt: 83.4g. Dimensions (millimetres/grams) L: length W: width B: breadth Th: thickness D: diameter Wt: weight\n\n\nDiscussion The palstave, represented by the joining fragments (nos. 1-2) is of a standard type for the Middle Bronze Age and specifically the Taunton phase, circa 1400 - 1275 BC which is widely distributed from sites in the South-West . No. 3 is of particular interest since casting jets dating to the Middle Bronze Age are unusual finds.\n\n\nConclusion The Middle Bronze Age scatter of bronze/copper metalwork represented by the palstave and casting was found over an area of approximately 15 x 10m. A single original deposit or hoard dispersed through the actions of the plough seems very likely. This material is eligible as Treasure under the new Treasure Order (2002) being a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects. This hoard constitutes an important addition to our knowledge of the Middle Bronze Age period in the south-west of Britain. Additional find, also reported: Tanged knife, fragment. Flat, thin-walled blade with corrosion damage on all edges. At base of the handle there are two short, linear mouldings projecting from either side. Part of edge bevel is evident on one side. L: 87.28mm; W: 6.2-17.9mm; Th: 2.35-3.3mm; Wt: 14.3g. The tanged knife fragment is datable to the Late Bronze Age and specifically the Ewart Park phase, 1000-800 BC. As such, and as the tanged knife fragment (no.4) was found approximately 50m from the group represented by nos. 1-3, it can not be considered as part of the group of Middle Bronze Age artefacts (nos. 1-3).
