The fragment is broadly rectangular in shape and lentoid in cross-section, with gradually tapering sides. The long edges are worn and uneven, being damaged in several places. The breaks at each end are old, worn and patinated, suggesting they occurred in antiquity. Both faces of the blade have etched decoration along the long edges in the form of four or five linear grooves. The area of the blade between this decoration is undecorated and plain in appearance.\n\n\n\nThe blade fragment is very worn and abraded. The surfaces are pitted and rough, with some lamination in places.\n\n\n\nThe patina is mid-green in colour and evenly distributed, with small sparse patches of mid-brown across the surfaces.\n\n\n\nThe blade fragment measures 33.08mm in length, a maximum of 20.94mm in width and a maximum of 5.56mm in thickness. It weighs 14.70 grams.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer for Shropshire, suggests that the blade is most likely the tip of a Late Bronze Age (c. 1100-800 BC) spearhead decorated with grooves, or possibly, based on the decoration, a fragment from an earlier object - such as an arreton / Snowshill dagger of the Early Bronze Age III (c. 1600-1400 BC), though these are very rare and thus more unlikely (e.g. HAMP-C13678).","fourFigureLat":"51.7434283","fourFigureLon":"-0.5240518","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"The finder reports that this was found within a few feet of BH-C4785A, which may or may not be related.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"September 01, 2021","datefound2":"September 01, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.56","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"Dacorum","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH6F439A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"33.08"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
