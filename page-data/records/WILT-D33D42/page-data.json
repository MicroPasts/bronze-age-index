The mount consists of a cast plate of copper alloy, moulded into to concentric circular bands separated by a ridge and with a raised border around the circumference. There is a circular perforation at the centre, with a second smaller perforation near the rim; the latter is probably due to a casting flaw. The bands are concave in cross section, and the reverse is flat. \n\n\n\nDiameter 24.9mm, of central aperture 3.6mm; Thickness 1.7mm; Weight 2.5g. \n\n\n\ncf. WILT-0DE04E and WILT-BF5B3E, amongst others on this database, although this example lacks a lug or similar method of attachment on the reverse. It was presumably affixed with a central rivet.","fourFigureLat":"51.01537053","fourFigureLon":"-1.95860828","fromdate":"-900","todate":"43","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alix Smith","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alix Smith","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"24.9","edge":null,"thickness":"1.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Broad Chalke","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridge/WILTD33D42.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
