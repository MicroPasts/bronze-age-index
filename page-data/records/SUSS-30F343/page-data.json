The blade has been worn down and is quite corroded, giving it a straigter profile rather than the more usual crescent. The sides of the axehead are smooth and the socket is almost circular in cross section. There is a defeined casting seam along the top and bottom edges. The axe has a slight taper from the blade but flares outward again at the socket. There is no decoration around the socket mouth.\n\n\n\nThere is a small knop of bronze on the inside of the socket which likely represents where the casting well was attached in the mould.  \n\n\n\nThere is a similar axehead in Savory 1980, pg.188 no.197, dated to the late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.96215031","fourFigureLon":"0.47640431","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edwin Wood","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mountfield","county":"East Sussex","district":"Rother","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/Axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
