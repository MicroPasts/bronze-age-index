The socket is gently convex below the blade, giving it the impression of bowing-out. The base of the socket is circular to the position of the circular peg holes (6mm diameter), positioned 40mm from the end. Above the peg holes, side and face ridges develop, giving the socket a sub-square profile. The side ridges run into the beginning of the blade and the face ridges develop into a pointed midrib, which continues to the tip. The blade is flame-shaped and comparatively slender. The blade is solid and the faces are very gently concave. The blade edge is stepped and survives along most of the length. The spearhead is in very good condition with crisp features. The casting seams have been removed and are not visible. The spearhead measures 287mm in length. The maximum external diameter of the socket base is 29.1-30.0mm. The maximum blade width is 52.0mm. The spearhead weighs 337.2 grams.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"This spearhead can be classed as Davis' (2015) Type 11A Generic, Flame-shaped. Group 11 spearheads have a broad chronology, beginning in the Penard metalworking phase of the later Middle Bronze Age (1275-1120 BC), but continuing to the end of the Late Bronze Age. Their main currency was in the Blackmoor-Ewart Park phases though (c.1000-800 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"30","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/Dscn2347.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"287"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
