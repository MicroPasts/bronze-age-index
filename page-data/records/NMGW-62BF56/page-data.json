The pin is complete, but has distorted slightly near the tip and has an overall length of 99.2mm. The pin is of circular section with a diameter of between 3 and 4mm. The head forms a circular ring with an external diameter of 14.2mm (8mm internal). The ring is slightly open with a gap of c.0.5mm between the end of the ring and the neck. The neck forms the characteristic U-bend, before the near right-angle to the pin shaft (86mm in length). The diameter of the shaft is constant until c. 35mm from the tip, where the pin thins to the point. The only decoration evident on the pin is a single incised line on the front and sides of the head, 2mm from the end of the loop. The pin weighs 7.3g and is in good condition with much of the surface preserved and a mid-brown patina. This find represents the twelfth recorded find of ring-headed and swan’s-neck pins in South East Wales (comprising the old counties of Glamorgan & Gwent) (Gwilt in press), including the five recent examples excavated at Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan. Ring-headed pins of this form without a solid ring commonly carry simple decoration with notches on the front of the ring (Dunning 1934, pp274). The simple decoration on this form of pin can be paralleled with an example from Meare in Somerset (ibid. fig 3) and from Margan foreshore in Wales (Wear, unpublished) where an example has further notches along the neck and head. Few ring-headed pins have been recovered from a securely dated context, but the simple form and decoration on this example may suggest a date within the first half of the date range suggested above.","fourFigureLat":"51.482725","fourFigureLon":"-3.4703","fromdate":"-750","todate":"-100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"4","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.92.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"99.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
