The fragmentâ€™s form has the general shape of a Neolithic stone axe head with evidence of some working to the blade area.\n\nAs it is made from a lead alloy, it may date anywhere from the Bronze Age, through to the Roman occupation.  Given that diminutive size of the piece, it may have been used as an amulet or votive offering.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Lead Alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Malpas","county":"Cheshire West and Chester","district":"Cheshire West and Chester","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2456-0039r.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"34"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
