The point end of the blade is rounded and the opposite edge broken off so that the rest of the blade and hilt, which would have all been cast as one piece, are missing. The sides of the blade come to a point and are slightly bevelled. The pronounced central ridge running up and down the length of the blade, rounded but not flattened in section, resembles the daggers and swords from the Penard (c.1250-1125 BC) and Wilburton (c.1125-975 BC) phases of the Bronze Age. But the mid-rib is only on one side of the blade which suggests that this is a fragment from a dagger blade, and more likely to date from the Penard phase, when daggers have been found associated with Ballintober swords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearce (1985) illustrates a small sword with Ballintober associations on page 602, Plate 41, No.314a from Washfield in Devon which is dated to the Penard phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearce (1984) illustrates a tanged knife with a central rib on page 44, Plate 12 from Isleham, Cambridgeshire which was found with a Wilburton sword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeedham & Rohl (1998) illustrates a Penard Taplow type sword on page 133, Fig.35, No.237, and a Wilburton type sword on page 134, Fig.36, Letter B, both with similar slightly ogival profiles in section, but does not illustrate any daggers from the period.","fourFigureLat":"50.587421","fourFigureLon":"-4.741979","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-975","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Teath","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Aug09finds 003.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
