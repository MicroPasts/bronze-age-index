The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum height above the septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge). There is a molding seam (or ridge) running the middle length of the blade on each side edge although on edge it is obscured by corrosion).There are three longitudinal ridges decorating each face of the blade from the stop ridge unevenly along the blade. The object has suffered heavy pitted corrosion on one edge and a few other areas of the palstave. The blade edge and the butt end are bother highly uneven and abraded which may be evidence of plough damage but the level of wear makes this uncertain. Where it survives the patina is dark green to mid-brown color. The corrosion is a light green turquoise colour.\n\n\n\nMeasurements:  154.52mm long, 27.17mm wide (at the stop ridge), 58.51mm thick (at blade tip, 23.15mm thick at butt end)  450g (aproximately)\n\n\n\nDiscussion: http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axe: The term palstave is very misleading as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool not a type of axe. However the term is used in British archeology to describe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and as time went on developed loops. This example fits the Acton Park (phase 2) or Taunton phases palstaves whcih date it to c. 1500 - c. 1150 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.1630289","fourFigureLon":"0.32981026","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"58.51","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pembury","county":"Kent","district":"Tunbridge Wells","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT2EE95F.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"154.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
