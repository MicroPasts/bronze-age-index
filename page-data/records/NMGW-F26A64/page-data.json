The side has a loop (24.27mm long 7.41mm wide and 9.78mm deep). The loop is irregular and springs from immediately beneath (5.3mm) the rim and there is no evidence of a mouth moulding. The casting seam is evident above the loop. The edges of the axe fragment are turning inwards, probably to the faces, and have a maximum width of 27.1mm. The fragment is distorted possibly from heat (melting) or possibly from being miscast.","fourFigureLat":"51.501237","fourFigureLon":"-3.427673","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Socketed axes date from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, in the Wilburton metalworking industry, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 6 (c.1,150 - 950 BC), however most axes recovered tend to date to the Ewart Park Metalworking Industry (Needham's ibid.
