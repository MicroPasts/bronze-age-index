From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\n\n\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\n\n\nCowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 & 283.\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.","fourFigureLat":"50.17408923","fourFigureLon":"-5.40458784","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-2000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"July 14, 2019","datefound2":"July 14, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hayle","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN7806.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
