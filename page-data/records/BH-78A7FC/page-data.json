The spearhead has a leaf shaped, lozenge-sectioned blade with a raised rounded mid-rib ridge extending to the tip that has areas of worn damage either side. The tip of the blade is broken and the edges are worn. The socket is also broken, the surviving hollow part being circular in section. The entire object has a dark green patina. The spearhead measures 64.2mm in length, a maximum of 25mm in width and a maximum of 11.6mm diameter at the socketed end. The blade is 2mm thick. The spearhead weighs 32.41 grams.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead appears to be part of the Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking tradition, phases that correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500-1150 BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.7868546","fourFigureLon":"-0.40664642","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"September 30, 2018","datefound2":"November 09, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"11.6","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Redbourn","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"St. Albans","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH78A7FC.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"64.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
