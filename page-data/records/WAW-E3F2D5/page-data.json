The axe is an elongated triangle, with rounded terminals. In profile the butt is tapers in thickness towards its edge. The thickest portion, in profile, is the point between the blade and butt. The blade, in profile tapers to a blunt, rounded edge. The axe is slightly asymmetrical in the centre and at the blade edge.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the axe has a well-developed light green-brown coloured patina.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 48.05mm in length, 21.24mm in width, 6.95mm thickness and weighs 24.0g.\n\n\n\nThe date of the axe is not certain. Flat axes initially date to the early Bronze Age, c. 2000 to 1600 BC, but do tend to be larger and have a facetted edge if it were used, for example WAW-049216. It is possibly this example is a model or miniature axe as the blade does not appear to be functional, unless it has been over used. Votive axes are known from the Roman period, such as DOR-8BF889. The surface condition may suggest the axe is dating to the Bronze Age rather than the Roman period, but as it is not certain a wide date range will be given.","fourFigureLat":"52.6949811","fourFigureLon":"-1.36519162","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"May 09, 2015","datefound2":"May 09, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carina Hughes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ellistown and Battleflat","county":"Leicestershire","district":"North West Leicestershire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWE3F2D5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"48.05"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
