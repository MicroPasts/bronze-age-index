The walls of the object are slightly more thick on one side. The object has a heavy,thick well developed brown coloured patina which is slightly pitted and incomplete. The exterior walls are very slightly concave in profile. On the exterior surface there is a sub-circular shaped platform which maybe a rivet head. However this is not certain as on the interior surface there is a possible small circular indentation. The interior surface has vertical striations. The patina appears to cover one terminal edge of the object suggesting this was the original edge. The opposite terminal is abraded. There is a small patch of patina on the edge, perhaps suggesting that the object was broken in antiquity or this is the original length.","fourFigureLat":"52.930383","fourFigureLon":"-1.927064","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Watson","datefound1":"September 30, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"22.18","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Croxden","county":"Staffordshire","district":"East Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/Wmid5454.tif","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"19.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
