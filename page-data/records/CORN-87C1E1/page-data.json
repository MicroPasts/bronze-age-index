The blade is tongue-shaped in plan and curved in section. The socket is cone-shaped in plan and in profile and square in section with a moulded ridge around the base of the socket. The casting seams remain on either side of the socket. The patina is good, but there has been some previous corrosion which has been professionally removed. There is also a faint mark in ink along one of the seams which may be an accession number or site reference, possibly LINC or LNC. The blade is 73 mm long, 22.5 mm wide and 3 mm thick and the socket is 55 mm long, 20.5 mm wide and 3.4 mm thick. This knife comes from a class of socketed knives made during the Late Bronze Age and thought to be used for woodworking, especially hollowing out. There are about ten of these that have been published in the British Isles and the majority come from Scotland. There are also a couple of examples in northern France. &quot;I had to examine these Scottish finds recently and can verify that they are like straight-bladed socketed knives; a bent spearhead from Bai&otilde;es in Portugal is at first glance similar. In this case, the asymmetrical position of the blade suggests it was intended to be bent, since straight blades are symmetrical with the socket&quot; (Brendan O&#39;Connor pers comm). Evans, J. (1881) illustrates similar examples in Ancient Bronze Implements of Britain and Ireland on pages 209-10. Coles, J. (1959-60) illustrates similar examples in Scottish late Bronze Age metalwork: typology, distributions and chronology in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland 93 on pages 46 &amp; 87. O&#39;Connor, B. (1980) discusses the typology for socketed knives from Hodges in the Ulster Journal of Archaeology 1956 on page 178. Double-edged socketed knives in France are covered by Gretel Gallay&#39;s PBF volume (VI/7, 1988).","fourFigureLat":"53.55327229","fourFigureLon":"-0.08442277","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"GRIMSBY","county":"North Lincolnshire","district":"North Lincolnshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Nellistfinds 010.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
