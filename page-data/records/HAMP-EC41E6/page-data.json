The center of the awl is circular in cross-section, tapering to a rectangular-sectioned tang and circular-sectioned tip.\n\nThe total length of the awl is 75.3mm, with the circular cross-section 4.3mm in diameter and a weight of 6.02g. The tang measures 2.4mm in width and 0.6mm in thickness, and the pointed end 1.0mm in diameter. The patina is greeny-brown in colour and a little rough.\nThe form of the awl does not change much through time and similar objects are also noted in the Roman period and possibly later.","fourFigureLat":"51.22761103","fourFigureLon":"-1.08483314","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Nicholas Mead","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Nicholas Mead","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"4.3","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cliddesden","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPEC41E6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"75.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
