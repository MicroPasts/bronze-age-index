There is a possibility that the button may be as early as late Bronze Age, although an Iron Age date is also possible. The button is discoudal and has decoration on the front consisting of a cast central circular boss within concentric grooves and a downward canted rim. Two lugs remain as part of a broken attachment loop on the reverse, and there is a very slight depression between these lugs. The button measures 20.64 mm in diameter, 3.6 mm thick and weighs 3.8 grams. It has some damage to its edges and suffers from some wear. It has a dark green patina with a paler green visible in the areas of damage. A similar example can be seen illustrated in Read's 'Metal Buttons' (2005, page; number 2).","fourFigureLat":"52.552508","fourFigureLon":"-2.28165","fromdate":"-900","todate":"43","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"March 27, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20.64","edge":null,"thickness":"3.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Claverley","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-498A82.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
