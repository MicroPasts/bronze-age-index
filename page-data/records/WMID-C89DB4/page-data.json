The butt of the axe has been broken and is badly corroded with some small areas of bronze disease.  The septum's length from the butt to the stop of the axe measures 66mm (as well as a width of 19mm), with low flanges measuring between 5-7mm in height either side.  The blade end of the axe has broken off 21mm after the stop, but this is far enough to notice a central rib running down its length on both sides, leading to what would have been the blade. The flange side is triangular in shape with a loop protruding outwards by 7.2mm level to where the stop is.  Overall, this incomplete axehead is in a fair but corroded condition in some areas, particularly  at the butt, flange facets and beyond the stop.  It is difficult to identify the true colour and patina of the axehead and the artefact has been coated in a substance, but it seems to have a patchy brown/ black patina with various areas of bronze disease.\n\n\nThis axehead seems to have similarities with other examples identified as from the Taunton industries, so called because of an especially rich series of finds that was made in the Vale of Taunton, dating from approximately 1400-1300 BC (Rohl & Needham, 1998, page 119, figure 21).  According to Pearce (1984, page 24), side loops became a regular feature in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age palstave industries, and the ribbed decoration was still popular from earlier examples.  A similar example of a ribbed palstave is illustrated in Pearce's book (Page 25, Fig 8a, Ref A) and was found at Cemmaes, Powys.\n\n\nMany other examples are illustrated in Watson's 'Catalogue of British & European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', 1993, Ref Nos 47-51 among the illustrated plates.  All these are classsified as Burgess group IIIa and have been found from Barton Green, Warwickshire; Middleton, Staffordshire; Berry Mound, Worcestershire; Britain: no provenance; Britain: no provenance respectively.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"January 01, 1997","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Teddesley Hay","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-C89DB4  2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"87.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
