The origin of these swords was probably found in imported French weapons which enjoyed a brief popularity in Britain during the late Penard phase, circa 1275-1140 BC. In Britain the Saint-Nazaire type swords are found in association with late Wilburton hoards, circa 1140-1020 BC, which often contain metalwork more appropriate to the succeeding Ewart Park phase, circa 1020-800 BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Tytherley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMPAF4AFF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"36.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
