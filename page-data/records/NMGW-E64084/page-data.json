Mouth is flared and trumpet shaped, with sub-rectangular internal and external shape. There are no haft ribs inside the socket and the base of the socket is evenly shaped. Axe has a wide onset collar 13.5mm in width. A low set loop extends from the lower edge of the collar, whilst the facets begin below the collar. The axe has divergent and concave sides expanding at the blade end, but with no recurving of blade edge sides. The casting seams are extremely ephemeral, illustrating the care and skill taken to cast this axe. The mouth surface appears to have been filed flat. The cutting edge has a moderate convex curve, with striations parallel to it on the blade bevel indicating preparation of the blade for use. Green carbonate encrustation over a green-grey patination.","fourFigureLat":"51.47427","fourFigureLon":"-3.426831","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"60","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"77.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
