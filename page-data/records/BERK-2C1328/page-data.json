Ogival blade expanded centrally. The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade. Two rivet holes to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, both of which still retains its rivet; the rivet is 11.5mm long with a 7.4mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The sides of the blade are straight and gradually taper to the point, running down the length of the blade on both sides is a very low central spine. Post depositional corrosion has resulted in shallow notches being removed from the side of the blade but otherwise this item is in very good condition with a light brown patina over most of the artefact.\n\nDirks, dagegrs and rapiers of this style are classified as the Wessex Culture (c.1800-1400 BC) by Read 2001, 76, no 625, fig 53 and as belonging to Group 2 in Burgess, C., and Gerloff, S. 1981, 'The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland'.
