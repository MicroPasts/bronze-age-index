Ribbed socketed axe - South Wales Type socketed axe\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 87.1mm; surviving blade width 44.6mm; surviving weight 156.8g.\n\n\n\nThis is a socketed axe with a damaged and largely absent mouth and damage to the blade end and lower side caused by erosion, lamination and detachment of the original surfaces from the core. The axe has a narrow and out-splayed mouth moulding, the top too damaged to observe its original shape or evidence for runner stubs. The axe is sub-rectangular in section with rounded face edges. The loop is absent, though two scars indicate the loop was high but descended from beneath the moulding. From the underside of the moulding on both faces, three ribs descend over three quarters of the length of the faces. Though largely parallel with each other, they curve slightly and converge slightly towards the blade end. Casting seams are visible down both sides, though they have been hammered down or filed. The blade end is too damaged to observe whether it was prepared for use. The axe has a brown patination and break edges are unstable and laminating in places.\n\n\n\n2. Plain slender socketed axe fragment - unidentifiable to type\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 84.4mm; surviving blade width 34.1mm; surviving weight 112.1g.\n\n\n\nThis is the blade and body of a plain slender socketed axe, missing its mouth end. The sides are near parallel with no evidence of recurving at the blade end. The surfaces are eroded, however there is no evidence of rib decoration on the upper blade and the face edges are rounded. The axe has a sub-rectangular cross-section. The loop is missing, though a pair of eroded scars are evident on one side. The blade edge, although eroded, exhibits a marked asymmetry, probably through repeated use and re-sharpening. The axe has a brown patination and the mouth breaks are unstable. There is surface cracking evident on one mid-face, suggesting surfaces are unstable and laminating.\n\n\n\n3. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - unidentifiable to type\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 76.8mm; surviving blade width 31.2mm; surviving weight 28.0g.\n\n\n\nThis is a highly eroded blade and side fragment of a slender socketed axe. The side of the axe is near straight and shows no recurving at the blade end. The narrow blade suggests a slender axe and the blade end is slightly assymetric, possibly through use and re-sharpening. The feint projecting line a possible linear rib can just be traced on the eroded axe face, suggesting that this was once a ribbed form of socketed axe. The loop is missing, however one loop scar is evident just beneath the side break, suggesting the axe was originally in the range of 100-110mm long. An apparent gently curved protrusion near the face edge has been created through differential erosion of the axe surfaces, the socket wall behind it being even and undistorted. All faces and breaks are highly eroded and the axe has a green patination.\n\n\n\n4. Socketed axe fragment - undiagnostic\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 59.3mm; surviving blade width 37.8mm; surviving weight 65.2g.\n\n\n\nThis is the highly eroded blade end fragment of a socketed axe. The sides are straight and parallel with no evidence of recurving at the blade end. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section. Insufficient of the axe faces survive to tell whether the axe was plain or had ribbed decoration. On one face, there is evidence of deliberate impact in antiquity with a sharp pointed tool or weapon, which has punctured and deformed the socket wall inwards in two places. The original axe surfaces are largely eroded and removed and the axe has a brown patination.\n\n\n\n5. Socketed tool fragment - undiagnostic\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 39.9mm; maximum surviving width 25.2mm; maximum thickness 12.5mm; surviving weight 20.3g.\n\n\n\nThis is a small highly eroded socket base and face fragment of a socketed tool of uncertain form. In side-section, the faces are tapering towards the blade end. The linear socket base and surviving width of the object suggest a narrow and flat bladed socketed tool - perhaps a socketed knife or a very slender axe. There is no moulding or change of slope evident on the surface to indicate a socket to blade transition. The lower breaks are extremely eroded, while the upper socket wall is laminating. Surface cracking and lamination is evident on one face and side. The artefact has a brown patination.\n\n\n\n6. Jet - two runner form\n\n\n\nDimensions: top surface length 27.9mm; top surface width 23.9mm; maximum height 19.6mm; weight 24.6g.\n\n\n\nThis is an oval shaped jet of conical form. The upper surface is uneven and has a radial cooling pattern. The underside tapers, taking the contours of the top of the clay mould. Two runners extend beyond the base of the reservoir and are elongate oval in shape, (8.8mm long and 4.5mm wide and 6.5 by 3.8mm in size at root). At one point, an irregular bronze protrusion extends sideways, once infilling a small cavity in the top of the mould. The jet has a green patination, although an area of the underside has a dark blue-grey patina. This artefact appears fresh and unworn.\n\n\n\nDiscussion (by Adam Gwilt)\n\n\n\nOne of the socketed axes in this group (No. 1) may be confidently identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over thirty hoards now contain at least 140 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).\n\n\n\nA second axe may be tentatively identified as a ribbed socketed axe (No. 3), but undiagnostic to type. Hoards containing multiple associations of South Wales Type socketed axes are common in south east Wales. Further types of ribbed socketed axes are also known and are also common components within Late Bronze Age hoards of Ewart Park date in Wales. These are variously known as Southern English/Welby Type ribbed axes, Yorkshire Type axes, Croxton Type axes, Llanarth Type axes and Breiddin Type axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-39; Needham 1990, 32-38; Northover unpublished, 267).\n\n\n\nThe presence of a plain socketed axe of slender form (No. 2) may also be discerned, however the absence of a mouth precludes certain identification to type. However, its slender proportions, lack of facets and sub-rectangular cross-section help to rule out many plain and all faceted types, while tending to point towards the axe belonging to a Class A South-eastern type socketed axe (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 212-7; Needham 1990, 28-31; Northover unpublished, Cats. 624-53). When found in hoards in Britain, they are almost exclusively dated to the Ewart Park/Carp's Tongue phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 216-7; Needham 1990, 30).\n\n\n\nThe axe blade fragment (No. 4), although not identifiable to type, did belong to a socketed axe. Socketed axes are a diagnostic artefact form of the Late Bronze Age, with the overwhelming majority made and buried at this time. While a few exceptional examples are known in the Middle Bronze Age and certain forms continued to be made and used into the Earliest Iron Age, the vast majority known in Wales and Britain belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. O'Connor 1980, 161 & 225; Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Gwilt 2004; Northover unpublished, 237-90). Therefore, the association of such an undiagnostic blade fragment is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard of Ewart Park date (1000-800 BC).\n\n\n\nThe socketed tool fragment (No. 5) is not identifiable to artefact type. Its narrow dimensions and narrow, linear socket base suggest either the mid blade fragment of a slender or small socketed axe, or perhaps the socket to upper blade interface of a socketed knife. The seeming absence of a step between the socket and upper blade and the lack of evidence for a perforation through the wall of the socket are factors suggesting that this socket fragment does not have dimensions entirely typical of Type Thorndon or Type Dungiven socketed knives (Hodges 1956; Gwilt et al 2005, 54-5). However, it is possible that this may have belonged to a knife with a particularly long socket or not entirely conforming to typical characteristics. Socketed axes of small size or very slender form, possessing narrow sockets and narrow blade widths do exist within the overall range of sizes and dimensions of socketed axes known in Britain and Ireland (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Pearce 1983; Eogan 2000; Northover unpublished). The width of this socket is particularly slender and implying an axe with a blade width in the range of 25-35mm. Very small or slender socketed axes may be of plain, faceted or ribbed types. It is likely that many had a specialist function, as distinct from the more common and general purpose axes.\n\n\n\nThe jet of two runner form (No. 6) is the excess reservoir of metal at the top of a mould and a bi-product of the casting process. Jets are commonly incorporated into hoards during the Late Bronze Age, yet are rarely present within hoards of Early and Middle Bronze Age date. Examples with between one and four runners are known. This relatively small example with two runners could have been used to cast a socketed axe, a spearhead or a socketed tool.\n\nThe South Wales Type axe (No. 1) and jet (No. 6) are diagnostic artefacts which may be dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age spanning from 1000 BC to 800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). The less diagnostic artefact fragments belong to classes of artefacts that are also consistent with this Ewart Park date. The range of possible artefact types suggested have been found in association with socketed axes of South Wales Type and within hoards of Ewart Park date in Wales.\n\n\n\nThe account of the discovery indicates that the artefacts were found buried at significant depth beneath the surface and closely clustered together. The artefacts were retrieved from four adjacent and deep detector pits, however no archaeological burial context, such as a pit, was observed by the finder. On the basis of this evidence, a hoard of directly associated artefacts can be confirmed. The finder indicated that the find-spot was within a boggy and uncultivated field, speculating that the hoard may have been buried in an ancient pond or within a river bed. Today, springs do issue into small stream channels in the immediate vicinity of the finds and in this boggy area, although the extent to which drainage patterns may have changed during the post-Medieval period through mining and quarrying is not fully known. This specific watery landscape locality may have been deliberately selected for the deposition of the hoard as a gift to the gods (Gwilt 2004, 121; Gwilt et al 2013, 11).","fourFigureLat":"51.52955004","fourFigureLon":"-3.31322757","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"References\n\n\n\nBriggs, C.S. & Williams, G.H. 1995.
