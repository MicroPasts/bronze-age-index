The fragment is rectangular with an H shaped cross section. Both front and reverse faces have raised flanges, which taper out towards the butt. No traces of decoration are visible. Air bubbles from the casting process are visible in the break.\n\n\n\nIt measures 29.5 mm in length, 26.4 mm wide and 10.3 mm thick (including flanges), 6.0 mm thick (not including flanges). The butt is 4.1 mm thick. It weighs 23.1 g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.\n\n\n\nA couple of similar palstave butt fragments have been recorded on the PASdatabase, including WMID-B04587; NMS-86C152; LIN-A5DA60 and NMGW-FC4B96.","fourFigureLat":"52.11231687","fourFigureLon":"-1.95760664","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"August 23, 2019","datefound2":"August 23, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norton and Lenchwick","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID8C75C9.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"29.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
