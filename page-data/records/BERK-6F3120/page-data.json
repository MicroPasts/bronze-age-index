The flanges start a short way in from the butt corners. They form a pointed oval shape in profile with the crest of the flange being the widest point, in the centre of the septum. There are slight bulges on the side in line with the fused stop with high flanges. There is a casting seam above but not below. There is a stop before the blade but it is unclear how deep it is. The blade widens in width forming triangular tips from which a crescentic, high cast shield shape.&nbsp;The transition between the blade and flange suggests a continuation into the decoration. The lower blade is distinctly curved and kicks out to the blade tip.","fourFigureLat":"51.01406303","fourFigureLon":"-1.44542482","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"Photos from finder\n\nNear identical examples are illustrated by Rowlands (1976: plate 27) which are categorised as Class 1 group 1 palstaves although its size is more appropriate for a Class 1 group 3 form.
