The chisel is represented by the blade, shoulder and the beginning of the tang. The tang has broken near the shoulder, and has a rectangular section. The break is not too recent has it has a different coloured patina to the surface. The tang expands in width towards the shoulder. Integral to each side of the shoulder is the remains of an integral lug. The thickness is of the chisel is at its greatest at this point at 5.38mm and may suggest a collar at the shoulder. The blade is a sub-triangle in plan with the sides being slightly concave and the blade is flared, convex and is abraded. The surface of the chisel has an incomplete dark brown patina, which is pitted, particularly on one surface. The chisel measures 38.98mm long and 18.74mm wide across the blade. It weighs 11.5g. \n\nTanged chisels occur from the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1450 BC to 600 BC.), and remain in use until Llyn Fawr Metalwork, 750 - 500BC. The collared chisel can be paralleled with a late Middle Bronze Age example found at Rhys Flintshire (Savory 1980, No 224 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections in the National Museum of Wales Cardiff).","fourFigureLat":"52.30101","fourFigureLon":"-2.162733","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"July 31, 2006","datefound2":"August 31, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.38","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hampton Lovett","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-F5FF52.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"38.98"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
