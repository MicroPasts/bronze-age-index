The spear has a very short and rounded leaf shaped blade, and two side loops on the socket; Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'.\n\n\n\nThe blade of the spear appears to be complete but it is unusually small at 37.4mm long and 24.6mm wide. The edge facets are about 3mm wide. The midrib continues to the very tip of the blade. It forms a pronounced rounded rib on each face. It can be described as conical, but is a little taller than it is wide.\n\n\n\nThere is 17mm between the base of the blade and the side loops. These are quite flat and have expanded pointed oval outer faces to the loops. The loops are 22.5mm long, 12mm wide and project 8mm from the shaft. Internally the loops are about 2mm wide and 7mm long. The casting seams are still visible between the loops and the blade but have been carefully trimmed. They are not visible between the loops and the mouth of the socket.\n\n\n\nThe mouth is circular and is 19.5mm external diameter. The walls are 2.8 - 3mm thick. The socket can be measured to at least 65.3mm deep. It tapers smoothly into the midrib.\n\n\n\nThe spear has a smooth tan brown patina with some slight pitting. Overall, it is 86mm long, 24.6mm wide, 18.8mm thick and is 57.81g.\n\n\n\nSide-looped spearheads are Class IV and date from the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, about 1500-1150 BC. GLO-F69302 is a similarly shaped example. Davis (2017) suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly.","fourFigureLat":"53.23774789","fourFigureLon":"-0.68293756","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"November 01, 2014","datefound2":"November 30, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Saxilby with Ingleby","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2526_spear2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
