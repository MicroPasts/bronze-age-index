The terminals appear to have been twisted prior to the purported breaks (possibly in the process of breaking them). The band has several bends and distortions and it is not clear what the original profile of the band would have been. There are a number of scuffs and striations to both surfaces. Possible small hammer markings can be seen, particularly on one side of the band. The remnants of a possible small perforation (c.0.2mm diameter) can be seen on one of the broken shoulders/terminals.\n\n\n\nDimensions \n\n\n\nExtant length: 74.47mm; Width (max.): 10.93mm; Width (terminals): 2.2mm; Thickness (max.): 0.7mm; Weight: 3.94g\n\n\n\nMetal composition \n\n\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a gold fragment found at 'the Wantage rally, Oxon', indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-88% gold, 10-12 % silver with approximately 1% copper.\n\n\n\nIdentification & discussion\n\n\n\nThe uncertainty regarding whether the terminals have been broken (and therefore the original form of the band) makes it difficult to be certain of its date. However, a number of parallels from the Portable Antiquities Scheme (Northfleet, Kent: Treasure Case 2004 T326, Brixton Deverill, Wiltshire: 2006 T250, Gussage-all-Saints, Dorset: 2013 T428 and Roche, Corwall: 2014 T39), and the metal composition of the band, suggest that a Bronze Age date is most likely. As Dr S. Needham pointed out in the report for Brixton Deverill (2006 T250): 'a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings'. The Wantage find could be positioned within this group and probably dates to the Middle to Later Bronze Age (c.1500/1400-800 cal. BC), rather than any earlier.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.
