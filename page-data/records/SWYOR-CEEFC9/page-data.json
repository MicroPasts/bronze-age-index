The tip and edges of the blade are missing. The breaks are patinated and worn. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded probably leaf-shaped blade. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge, one incomplete. The spearhead measures 67.6mm long, has a maximum width of 16.4mm across the base of the blade, and maximum thickness of 13.8mm across the socket. The depth of the socket more than 21.8mm but there is still dark orange brown clay filling the far end. The spearhead weighs 18.4 grams.\n\n\n\nThe sides of the blades have been much abraded in the soil, loosing most of their shape and also the cutting edges. However, the overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (base to tip) lozenge shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear and is best described as being conical in shape. The surviving end of the socket has a diameter of 13.4mm and a thickness of 2mm. The string loops are 13mm from the base of the blade and they are oval. The loops have a maximum length of 9.6mm, width 2.7mm, and thickness of 2.2mm. Only two stubs survive of one, and the other is filled with brown corrosion product. There is an oval hole in the side of the socket next to the complete loop. These loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.\n\n\n\nThere are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams on either edge of the spear still stand proud of the socket. The spearhead is a dark brown colour with a smooth surface. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.\n\n\n\nA similar example is HESH-C348E5 which notes that: \"Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of that example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC.\" Davis (2017) suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly.","fourFigureLat":"53.56530469","fourFigureLon":"-1.11065978","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"May 25, 2013","datefound2":"May 25, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thorpe in Balne","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2234_spear_brown.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"67.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
