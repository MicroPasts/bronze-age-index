The everted collar is 7 mm deep and about 10 mm below the everted collar is a transverse moulding, from which five parallel vertical ribs extend down the blade at right angles, on each face. Two of the longitudinal ribs form a border on either side where the axe is chamfered at a sharp angle. The ribs are 2 mm thick, 40 mm long and 6 mm apart. The side loop extends from the transverse moulding down the side of the axe to a length of 24 mm with an aperture that is 10 mm in diameter. The casting seam is evident above the side loop and above the transverse moulding on the other side of the axe, but the rest of the two seams that continue down the sides of the axe have been chiselled flat. The blade has slightly expanded corners, and the edge is undamaged, suggesting that the axe may not have been used. There are file marks on one face of the blade, where an area of corrosion has been filed away since its recovery, and it is away from the edge so that this is not a contemporary re-working of the blade, and the cutting edge has not been re-sharpened. Otherwise the axe is in very good condition with only a few patches of corrosion.\n\n\n\nSocketed axes with sub-square socket mouths, everted collars and straight blades can be found during the Llyn Fawr metalwork phase (c.800-700 BC) of the Late Bronze Age into the Early Iron Age, such as the Sompting type socketed axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 138, fig.40, no.405).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a socketed axe with a transverse rib and five vertical ribs and a slightly expanded blade, from Yorkshire, in plate 103, no.1620, which is classified as a Type Sompting variant, now dated from c.800-600 BC (Matt Knight pers comm).\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a local Llyn Fawr socketed axe with three ribs from Mylor in Cornwall on pages 35 & 77, pl.4, no.54a.","fourFigureLat":"52.1392743","fourFigureLon":"-1.92835824","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"In a private collection, recorded for academic use","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"43","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Harvington","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June16finds190.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"114"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
