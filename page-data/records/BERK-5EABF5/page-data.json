The cutting edge is splayed and curved with 'V' groves in the sides where the blade has been hammered into form. There are worn casting flashes to the sides. The axe has a clean break parallel with the blade and 4.5 cm above the tip of the blade.\n\n\n\nThere is a darker area of casting in the centre of the break which may be indicative of the bottom of the socket having been just above that break. Perhaps it may also be due to some form of deferential cooling of the core. It may be possibility that it is a fragment from an earlier form of palstave axe. That would take the date back to around 1500 BC.\n\n\n\nThe surface has a dark green patina now damaged by age, the blade edge shows no sign of use, hence this may have been a votive offering.","fourFigureLat":"51.54455436","fourFigureLon":"-1.43900311","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"September 07, 2013","datefound2":"September 07, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Letcombe Regis","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BERK5EABF5.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
