Tip because there is a clear break at the larger end and the remains of the socket.  The depth of the remaining socket is 19mm.  The midrib section is round and the remnants of the blade might suggest that it was leaf shape.  The internal diameter of the socket is 7.85mm at the break.   In this example, the surface has a considerable number of longitudinal striations that run parallel to the expanding midrib section.  They may therefore be a result of the moulding process.  Additionally, there are numerous longitudinal and near longitudinal scratches and striations more likely caused by use.  The tip is chipped and that would seem to have been caused in antiquity.    There are also a great number of short, near horizontal scratches to one side of the midrib section.  Could they be the result of some twisting movement of the tip?  Looking at the face elevation, there is also a very slight bend in the end of this spear tip.  The blade wings are now mostly corroded away with no cutting edge now present.  The overall patina is of a dark green/brown.","fourFigureLat":"53.070503","fourFigureLon":"-2.94172","fromdate":"1200","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"May 25, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Holt","county":"Wrexham","district":"Wrexham","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2873-0003.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"47.86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
