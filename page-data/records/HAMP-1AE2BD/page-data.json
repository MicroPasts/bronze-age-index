The long edges are both jagged and circa one third is folded transversely back on/ under itself. The terminal at the shorter end appears complete. It narrows to a point which is again folded back on itself, perhaps incidentally or perhaps intentionally - it could be interpreted as a hook. The terminal at the opposite end also narrows to a point and is intentionally cut in a straight diagonal on one edge. This terminal is also folded back on itself. As the object presents now both terminals bend in the same direction, but without the transverse bend of the object they would bend in opposite directions.\n\nAt the centre of the object it measures max.7.4mm wide. This narrows to 2.6mm and 2.7mm at the terminal folds. The object has a length of 18.5mm and weighs 0.51g. Its estimated length without the transverse fold is c.28mm.","fourFigureLat":"50.81308425","fourFigureLon":"-0.97940201","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-800","notes":"\nThe object is perhaps related to gold ornaments/ strips known from the Bronze Age of Southern England.\n","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"November 03, 2019","datefound2":"November 03, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hayling East","county":"Hampshire","district":"Havant","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP1AE2BD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"18.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
