Awl, incomplete, with most of the tang absent, perhaps through miscasting. The cross-section of the pointed part is sub-square at the start, becoming round before the point. Weight 2.68g. Length 35mm. Width 4.5mm.\n\n\n\n2. Awl, incomplete, with most of the tang absent. The cross-section of the pointed part is sub-square at the start, becoming round before the point. Weight 3.63g. Length 28mm. Width 5.5mm.\n\n\n\n3. Awl, with tang of irregular hexagonal cross-section and very short round-sectioned point. The tang is at its widest at its hollow end (4 x 2mm) .Weight 2.09g. Weight 3.84g. Length 31mm, of which the point comprises only 8mm.\n\n\n\n4. Awl, rectangular-sectioned tang only. Weight 3.85g. Length 31mm. Width 5.7mm.\n\n\n\n5. Fragment of a socketed tool with a moulded groove on the exterior below the mount. Weight 9.15g. Length 29mm.\n\n\n\n6. Lower part of a socketed chisel with curved cutting edge. There is much distortion around the break. Weight 35.97g. Length 44mm. Width 37mm.\n\n\n\n7. Fragment of two-edged knife, both ends broken. Weight 8.94g. Length 36mm. Width 4 - 6.3mm. Thickness 3.8mm.\n\n\n\n8. Bead, annular with off-centre aperture and very fine encircling rib or casting seam. Weight 2.16g. Diameter 12mm. Thickness 3.4 - 4.3mm. Hole diameter 6mm.\n\n\n\n9. Bead, annular, bi-convex, with rib or casting seam around one third of the exterior and a groove around one quarter, the two separated by plain areas. Weight 2.37g. Diameter 10 - 11.5mm. Thickness 5.3mm. Hole diameter 5.5mm.\n\n\n\n10. Incomplete ingot, sub-rectangular, one edge broken, flat-sectioned, one face covered with irregular moulded striations. Weight 18.83g. Length 37.5mm. Width 29mm. Thickness 2.5mm.\n\n\n\n11. End fragment of rectangular sectioned ingot. The end is convex and there are hammer marks on one broad face. Length 14.5mm. Width 23.3mm. Thickness 8.5mm.\n\n\n\n12. Ingot of irregular cross-section narrowing towards both ends. There are hammered facets overall apart from a shallow concavity running the full length. Weight 16.56g. length 42.5mm. Width 10mm. Thickness 7.2mm.\n\n\n\n13. Ingot, a slightly curving bar of triangular cross-section. Weight 10.18g. Length 33.5mm. Width 11.5mm. Thickness 6mm.\n\n\n\n14. Twenty-three fragments of solidified molten copper alloy, ranging in weight from 0.69 to 26.72g. Combined weight 120.90g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The combination of (socketed) tools, awls and ingot fragments suggests that this represents a Late Bronze Age (c.1000 - 700 BC) hoard. It shares some features in common with a previous hoard of Late Bronze Age metalwork (2008 T454), including the presence of socketed tools and ingot fragments.","fourFigureLat":"52.712382","fourFigureLon":"0.633602","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Rogerson","datefound1":"April 08, 2013","datefound2":"May 06, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Andrew Rogerson","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"36","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Acre","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edarch/31075_1FB7C5_LBA_Hoard_1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
