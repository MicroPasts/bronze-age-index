The edges are very damaged, some ancient and some recent (plough). It measures 83.50mm in length and weighs 36.05g.\n\nThe spearhead is max.20.73x10.62mm and min.13.42x7.08mm at either end. In cross-section, the central rib is diamond-shaped with the c.2mm thick blade extending from opposing points. At both breaks, the central rib is solid, suggesting the spearhead would have originally been quite long. It is uncertain if any part of the edge is original (ie.not damaged) which in turn makes it harder to date and attribute to a type.\n\nThe spearhead is coated in ?varnish.","fourFigureLat":"51.203625","fourFigureLon":"-1.62923","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"November 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.62","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kimpton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Robbins0210spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"83.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
