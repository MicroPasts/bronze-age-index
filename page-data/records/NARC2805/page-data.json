In plan the cutting edge is crescentic, either end of the crescent coming to an almost upturned point, the sides of the head are almost parallel from the cutting edge upwards, narrowing only slightly to the flanges. There is a U shaped depression as the flanges begin to expand, and on one face the suggestion of trident shaped moulded decoration, however, both faces are badly corroded and the decoration is very faint., the lip at the junction between the handle and the head is a shallow U-shape.  In profile, the head and cutting edge form a narrow tall V-shape, expanding to form an oval, the palstave is broken off at the point where the sides of the oval are curving towards a point at the end furthest away from the cutting edge.  There is a slight median ridge down both of the sides of the palstave when viewed in profile., the flanges are very high and do not curve inwards.  In cross-section the head is trapezoidal.  There is no loop or obvious loop stump.","fourFigureLat":"52.195063","fourFigureLon":"-0.699341","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"the length is given between cutting edge and junction lip of handle, the width at cutting edge and the thickness at the widest part of the flanges.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"November 01, 2001","datefound2":"February 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"33.26","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Easton Maudit","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Wellingborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rharte/narc2805a(s).jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"71.12"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
