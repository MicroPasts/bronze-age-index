The entire head has been cast integral, with a conical socket retaining lozenge-shaped sideloops near the base of the socket. No flashmarks are visible.\n\n\n\nThe blade was originally 'leaf-shaped', with angular shoulders, but the blades on each side of the head have been repeatedly sharpened over the course of its life, reducing the size of the blade considerably. The socket extends into the base of the blade, with a well-defined rib emerging from the socket and running the length of the blade, with the rib also having been filed with the edges as the blade became reduced in size. The lower blade, near each shoulder probably also appears to have been resharpened.\n\n\n\nThe surface has an even brown patina with patches of orange corrosion, and occassional small pits of green corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"55.0245348","fourFigureLon":"-2.0171758","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"November 26, 2013","datefound2":"February 25, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"18.25","edge":null,"thickness":"2.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittington","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/NCL-E6C2CE.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"105.18"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
