The chisel is sub rectangular in plan, tapering slightly into the cutting edge and is circular in cross section, becoming crescentic towards the cutting edge. The opposite end is socketed with a circular mouth and an expanded collar on the outside. A prominent longitudinal casting seam is extant on either lateral edge.
