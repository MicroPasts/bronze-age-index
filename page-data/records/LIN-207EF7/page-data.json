It has a flat, rectangular body that gradually tapers towards the butt end. Half way along the axe on either side is a shallow stop-ridge that seem to be early forms of the more prominant versions seen on palstaves. \n\n\nThe axe has a brownish patina; the surface is smooth and in good condition.\n\n\nThe axe is probably an Aylesford type developed flat axe, dating from 2150-1500 BC. Similar examples can be seen in Moore and Rowlands, plate VI.
