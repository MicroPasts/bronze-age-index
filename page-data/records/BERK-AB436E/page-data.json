The blade fragment consists of part of the tang, which is under half-complete, broken through a central perforation, possibly a rivet to secure the tang to the weapon handle. There is a large notch in one side of the tang, which would have presumably been repeated on the opposing edge. Below the notch the blade begins to taper in width to the break; all breaks appear ancient. The blade has a nearly flat cross section. This object may have been reworked (includng the addition of the rivet hole) and possibly reduced by continual sharpening, which is seen on other examples. The fragmentary nature of the object makes classification difficult.","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017079.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"56.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
