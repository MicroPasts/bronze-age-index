It is a South Eastern ribbed type. The axe has a square, collared socket, from which two faces angle inwards, widening at the point at which they meet to form a slightly curved cutting edge. The mouth has a double collar moulding, the upper one more pronounced. There is a D-shaped loop springing from the lower collar on one of the triangular side faces. There are three ribs spaced evenly but closely across the front, and three on the back face, extending approximately halfway down the face. A casting seam is visible along both side faces, and there are the stubs of four casting jets, one on each edge of the mouth, with internal casting seams down the centre of the front and back faces of the axe. The cutting edge is extensively chipped, showing light green metal beneath the smooth blueish green patina. It is 80.29mm long, 40.61mm high, 37.37mm wide and weighs 216g. The socket is 59.6mm deep, 27.8mm wide internally. \n\n\n\nThis axe fits the Ewart Park phase, metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC. This axe is likely to date from about 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"54.3050911","fourFigureLon":"-1.64804311","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Chris Scriven","datefound1":"November 08, 2017","datefound2":"November 08, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Chris Scriven","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"40.61","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Patrick Brompton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Richmondshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYORCAB4F0BronzeAgeSocketedAxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"80.29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
