The butt is straight and flat with a little damage (12mm wide and 2mm thick). The sides are near-straight and divergent for the entire length of the axe-chisel, reaching the maximum width at the blade (of 26.4mm and with a thickness of 1.5mm). Much of the original blade edge is lost, which is of curved form but was not recurved. Both faces are very gently convex across their lengths but reach a maximum thickness (of 5.7mm) approximately one-third of its length from the butt (15mm from the butt) and is near-flat across their widths. There is no discernible median bevel or blade facets, although the blade faces converge more sharply (beginning 9mm from the blade edge). The side has a lenticular profile and there are no 'developed' features evident on the axe-chisel. The original surface has nearly all been lost with small remnant patches evident on both faces with a mid-green patina, elsewhere the pitted surface has corroded bright-green to green brown.","fourFigureLat":"51.96454255","fourFigureLon":"-2.9620237","fromdate":"2200","todate":"1900","notes":"Early Bronze Age axe-chisel implements are difficult to relate to established axe typologies with any confidence. This example has no 'developed' features, perhaps indicating an early date of the bronze implements from the Early Bronze Age but also possibly because of a restricted casting technology and limited subsequent working. It could be suggested that the axe displays features more similar to Needham's Type 2 axes with a lenticular profile, comparatively wide butt and straight sides (perhaps 2C /D), although visual examination suggests a bronze rather than copper metallurgy. It is possible to suggest therefore that the axe may belong to Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Eirini Anagnostou","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Longtown","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/eanagnostou/201619.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
