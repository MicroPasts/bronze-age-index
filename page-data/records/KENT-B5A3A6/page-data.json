The sides curve inwards from the curved crescent blade-edge, flaring in section to a rectangle. The break across the body is irregular. The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to dark brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety. It looks like it was not faceted or had a ribbed decoration.\n\n\n\nMasurements: 32.87mm long, 45.8mm wide, 15.54mm thick and 80.65g in weight","fourFigureLat":"51.19510472","fourFigureLon":"1.24755845","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.54","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eythorne","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTB5A3A6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"32.87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
