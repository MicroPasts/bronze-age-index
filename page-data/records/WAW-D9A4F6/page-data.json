The length, from the tip to the base is 48.5mm, and the width across the widest portion of the blades is 13mm. \n\n\n          \n     In plan the spear is sub-triangular. It terminates with a damaged blunt point. The tip has a square section. The damage is not too recent. \n\n\n      \n     The blades are slightly convex, but the edges are abraded. In section the blades taper towards the edge. In the centre of the spear, on both faces there is a vertical ridge which has a convex surface. This forms the socket of the spear. On one surface from the base a portion of this ridge is broken away, revealing the socket. \n\n\n     \n     The lower edge is more circular in section, and again is broken, but not recently.\n\n\n     \n     The spear has a mid brown coloured patina with occassional pitting.\n\n\n      \n Phil Watson suggests the spearhead is of Middle Bronze Age date. This is perhaps indicated by the lozenge shaped section which are more typical of basal and side looped spearheads than of Late Bronze Age pegged spearheads.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"October 17, 2003","datefound2":"November 18, 2003","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-D9A4F6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"48.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
