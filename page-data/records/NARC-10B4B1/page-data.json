The object is circular sectioned and slightly curved in plan with transverse cuts at both ends. One of the cuts in not clean and the object appears to have ben initially cut, with the remaining 50% of the bar being broken off. There are some minor shallow gouges in the surface of the object. \n\n\n\nLength: 58.42mm, Diameter: 5.02mm, Weight: 17.0g \n\n\n\nThe original form would likely have been similar to LEIC-A3A9AE.\n\n\n\nSeveral similar fragments of goldwork have been recovered from hoards containing diagnostically Bronze Age objects (e.g. Poulton, Gloucestershire: Treasure case 2004 T17 and the Fitzleroi Farm, West Sussex, hoard: BM accession nos. 1996, 0902.1-42). Those hoards, and several others recorded in recent years, contain fragments of gold that has been snipped with a pincer like instrument, similar to the Calbourne fragment. The shape of the terminal is relatively universal but can be compared to other round section bar bracelets of Bronze Age date (e.g, with 2011 T926 (CAM-08B4E0) cf. Taylor 1980. Furthermore, the composition of the gold does not disagree with a Later Bronze Age date.\n\n\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis shows a composition of 78.07% gold, 15.47% silver and 5.67% copper.","fourFigureLat":"52.2234064","fourFigureLon":"-0.83027201","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.
