The object is composed of two conical sprues or flashes with an ovate in plan, the projections are triangular in profile.\n\n\n\nCasting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below and around the gate piece which had two conical apertures. As they represent re-usable metal, they were often retained and regularly turn up in base metal hoards of the period; see, for example, Treasure case 2006 T36, from Devon.\n\n\n\nLength: 36.56mm, Width: 44.19mm, Thickness: 24.47mm, Weight: 87.6g.\n\n\n\nThe metal is a dark green with some areas of pitting.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar casting jet with conical sprues from Lelant in Cornwall, which was found associated with swords fragments that are from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) on page 571, pl.10, no.82e.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a casting jet from Gussage All Saints in Dorset on page 82, pl.9, no.247f, which was found with a socketed axe mouth fragment.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples can be seen on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database: LVPL-0C459C, LANCUM-8A5846 and BH-8BDE6E","fourFigureLat":"52.28130908","fourFigureLon":"-1.3418004","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24.47","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leamington Hastings","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC85E2F5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Eleanore Cox","length":"36.56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
