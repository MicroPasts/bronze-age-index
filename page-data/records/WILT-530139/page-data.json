The artefact is a nearly complete short dagger now, but probably started off as a rapier with a long, very narrow blade. It now measures 50.4mm in length, 16.25mm wide, 2.85mm thick and weighs 6.76 grams.\n\n\n\nThe blade is triangular in shape and lenticular in cross-section, with a broad flat midrib. It extends from a flat D-shaped butt-end with central notch (2.2mm thick and 14.65mm wide) to either side of the butt is a broadly triangular notch.\n\n\n\nThe blade narrows from 4.15mm wide and 1.15mm thick.\n\n\n\nOriginally this blade may have been a Group IV rapier, possibly of Type Appleby or Type Cornacarrow with an oblong butt, two side notches and - unusually - a single notch at the top. It may have broken and then reworked into a short dagger with triangular blade.\n\n\n\nReference: Burgess, C. and Gerloff, S. 1981. The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland.
