The cutting edge is worn and damaged so the original edge no longer survives, but curved shape and the curved expanding nature of the sides suggest it may have originally possessed slightly flared tips. The incomplete nature of this axe means it cannot be definitely assigned a type.\n\n\n\nThe break has occurred at the point that the socket opening began, though only about 3mm of the socket wall survives above this. This is nonetheless sufficient to demonstrate that the axe was cast with a misaligned core, as indicated by the differential thickness of the socket walls on each face (5.4mm and 2.4mm); this may have influenced the breakage. There is a slightly bowing inwards on the face with the thinner socket wall, which may represent an impact blow.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is heavily pitted with green corrosion, though retains a patchy bronze patina particularly around the edges.\n\n\n\n\nSocketed axe or palstave fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 21.8mm; surviving width 44.2mm; thickness 10.4-14mm; weight 59.6g.\n\n\n\nThis is a thick copper alloy fragment, roughly sub-rectangular in plan and elliptical in section, tapering in side profile to one edge. The object has broken across both the long edges in antiquity, but the shorter sides appear to be largely original. The overall form is suggestive of the lower blade of an axe, which is supported by the remains of a casting seam on one side, though the fragment lacks any diagnostic features that might allow it to be assigned to a specific type. In the thicker break there are possible faint remnants of a socket aperture, though this feature is not conclusive. Alternatively, the thick nature of the fragment could infer a palstave.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is covered by a combination of smooth silvery patina and green corrosion pitting. There are also patches of bronze patina particularly around the edges.\n\n\n\n\nJet - one runner\n\n\n\nDimensions: top surface length 26.0mm; top surface width 21.5mm; maximum height 36.5mm; weight 48.0g.\n\n\n\nThis is a roughly oval-shaped conical jet with a thick single runner extending from the pouring reservoir. The upper surface is rough and uneven, representing the dross created by metal as it cools while the runner is smooth. The upper surface is largely level, but the sides around the reservoir are slightly raised; this is a natural result of the cooling process. There is no distinction in the transition between the reservoir and the runner, suggesting the metal was poured into a mould with a wide conical opening. The runner tapers to a thick point with slightly concave sides from the reservoir.\n\n\n\nThe jet is pitted with green corrosion, though largely retains a bronze patina.\n\n\n\n\nIncomplete jet\n\n\n\nDimensions: top surface length 22.8mm; top surface width 19.9mm; maximum height 16.8mm; weight 21.5g.\n\n\n\nThis is the pouring reservoir of a broadly oval jet, with a rough, uneven upper surface, representing metal dross, and a dip in the metal towards the centre. The reservoir narrows with slightly\n\n\n\nconvex sides towards the runner, creating an overall 'bowl' shape, indicating the shape of the mould opening. However, the jet has broken at the transition from the reservoir to the runner(s). It is thus unclear whether this would form one or two runners.\n\n\n\nThe jet is covered in a rough grey patina, intermitted with patches of bright green corrosion or bronze disease.\n\n\n\n\nProbable rapier fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 49.6mm; hilt width 24.1mm; hilt thickness 5.2mm; butt width 15.8; butt thickness 4.4mm; width at break 14.3mm; thickness at break 4.2mm; weight 27.0g.\n\n\n\nThis is a small copper alloy fragment of a probable hilt from a blade, broken across the upper blade. The fragment is quite worn, making diagnostic features difficult to ascertain. However, the fragment shows signs of rounded asymmetrical hilt shoulders that taper down to a narrow blade with a biconvex section, which is characteristic of a rapier. Additionally, above the shoulders the fragment tapers inwards to two possible notches before projecting to a rounded butt. It is thus likely this piece once belonged to a rapier.\n\n\n\nThe object has broken across the upper blade in antiquity and the break is now worn. There are no associated marks or casting flaws.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is worn and pitted with green corrosion, though retains a patchy bronze patina particularly around the edges.","fourFigureLat":"51.76287367","fourFigureLon":"-3.98657857","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"This hoard of objects can certainly be dated to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) and probably to the Late Bronze Age (1100-800BC), however in its fragmentary state, the artefacts lack closely diagnostic elements to allow conclusive dating to a particular period within this broader frame. Many fragmentary hoards were deposited during the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age and it is likely, on a balance of probability, the hoard dates to this period.\n\n\n\nBroken socketed axes (such as No.1 above) are a feature of Late Bronze Age hoards, typically dating to the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 cal. BC) (Needham et al. 1997). It is common for axes to be broken across the point of the internal socket aperture and examples of similar breakage patterns can be seen on four examples in the St. Nicholas hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt n.d.). The slight bowing on one face may indicate this piece was deliberately broken before deposition.\n\n\n\nThe second axe fragment (No.2 above) is harder to interpret because while it is likely to have belonged to a socketed axe, the thick nature of the fragment, and lack of any additional features, means one cannot rule out the possibility that it once belonged to a palstave. This might be further supported by the narrow nature of the blade, which is a feature of both Transitional and Late palstaves (Smith 1959). Transitional palstave have been dated to the Penard-Wilburton phases (c.1300-1000 BC), while Late palstaves held currency in the Wilburton to Ewart Park phases (c.1100-800 BC) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 145-163; Needham et al. 1997). Given the other associations in this hoard, it is most likely that this fragment once belonged either to a socketed axe or to a Late palstave, both types circulating during the Late Bronze Age. Complete examples of Late palstaves were found in Late Bronze Age hoards from Colwinston and Tal y garn 1, while two palstave butt fragments were present in the Penllyn hoard, all Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt and Lodwick 2003; Gwilt et al. 2012a; Gwilt et al. 2015). In total, about 60 examples of Late palstaves are known from Wales in hoards and as single finds.\n\n\n\nThe jets (Nos 3, 4) represent the excess reservoirs of metal at the top of moulds and are a by-product of the casting process. Jets are commonly incorporated into hoards during the Late Bronze Age, yet are rarely present within hoards of Early and Middle Bronze Age date. The generic nature of these two jets means the objects they produced cannot be determined. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets are more typically represented in hoard associations dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.920-800 BC). They are now known from numerous Ewart Park phase hoards in Wales including the St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), Cowbridge (Vale of Glamorgan) and Glascoed (Monmouthshire) hoards (Gwilt and Lodwick 2002; Lodwick and Gwilt 2002; Gwilt et al. 2011; 2012b).\n\n\n\nThe final object in the hoard, the possible rapier (No.5), is an interesting element. Rapiers hold their main currency in the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC), with the last phase of their production ending in the Penard phase (1300-1150 BC), when they were superseded by developments in sword-making (Burgess and Gerloff 1981, 113). Although worn, enough survives of this fragment to suggest it belonged to a Group IV rapier, as indicated by the side notches, slender shoulders and small butt (ibid., 62). Group IV rapiers belong to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age but continued in use into the Wilburton phase at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the centuries from 1300 to 1000 BC (ibid., 106-109). These are the most common of the British rapier forms and they were also commonly reworked later during their use lives, often being found as broken and undiagnostic fragments, suggesting that some remained in use and circulation over a long time period. It is entirely feasible therefore, that a rapier made towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age could remain in use and circulation into the Late Bronze Age, only being deposited in a hoard then. In Wales, a possible Group IV rapier fragment was deposited with fragments of two Late palstaves, a spearhead and a flat plate at Penllyn, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt et al. 2015).\n\n\n\nThe consistent patina and corrosion of the components in this hoard suggest they all entered the ground at around the same time. These were then likely dispersed by historical and modern agricultural processes. The majority of the objects (Nos 1-4) are consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, probably the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 BC), when the burial of fragmentary hoards was a common practice. Examples from Wales include hoards from Tal-y-garn 1 and 2, Colwinston (all Vale of Glamorgan), and Glascoed (Monmouthsire) (Lodwick and Gwilt 2002; Gwilt and Lodwick 2003a; 2003b; Gwilt et al. 2012a). The rapier fragment predates the other objects in the hoard, in its manufacture, by up to 300 years, but it is likely it represents an old object that remained in circulation use and re-use, or perhaps as a piece of scrap metal, until the Late Bronze Age. Alternatively, it may represent the rediscovery of an older deposit that was then reburied. The proximity of the rapier to the other finds within a three metre square area, coupled with the lack of contemporary deposits in the surrounding area and the consistent condition of the artefacts means that on the balance of probability the rapier can be considered associated with the other material. In terms of size and composition, the Mawr hoard is most closely comparable with the Penllyn hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt et al. 2015).\n\n\n\nThe find-spot is located on a north-facing promontory about 163m above sea level and overlooking the River Cathan to the north-east, which feeds westwards into the larger River Loughor. A preliminary search of the Historic Environment Record revealed no other Bronze Age or prehistoric features recorded from the immediate area\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nBurgess, C.B. & Gerloff, S.
