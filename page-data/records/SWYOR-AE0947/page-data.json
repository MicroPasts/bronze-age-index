Only the socket and the lower part of the blade survives. There are side loops on the socket, and the recess only extends just into the blade. There is a casting flaw leaving a hole in one face of the lower blade. Most of the blade has broken off and is missing, and the break is patinated. The midrib has a lozenge shaped cross-section. The mouth of the socket may be broken too - it ends unusually close to the loops and the side curve outwards. There is also a tear in one face of the socket. One face of the spearhead is pitted except on the base of the socket, with a straight line between the two finishes, raising the question of what caused this differential patination. The spearhead is 70.0mm in length, width 29.6mm (including socket loops) thickness is 15.2mm tapering to 12.7mm at the flattened broken end. 45.3g.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead appears to fit into Davis Group 2 \"Early Socketed\" because the socket does not extend far into the blade (Davis, 2017,  Later Prehistoric Finds Group Datasheet 5). He dates these spearheads to the Arreton phase, 1700 BC - 1550 BC.","fourFigureLat":"54.21320508","fourFigureLon":"-1.21947528","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1550","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Diane Gourley","datefound1":"December 09, 2018","datefound2":"December 09, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Diane Gourley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kilburn High and Low","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYORAE0947BronzeAgeSpearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"70"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
