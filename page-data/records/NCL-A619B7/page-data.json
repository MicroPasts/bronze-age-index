The butt has suffered some minor damage to its rounded end. There is no  evidence for a loop on the upper face of of the axehead.\n\n\nThe surface is relatively consistent in pitting/quality and colour.","fourFigureLat":"54.168561","fourFigureLon":"-1.266268","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"December 06, 2011","datefound2":"February 02, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"44.26","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.38","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thormanby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/NCLA619B7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"143.77"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
