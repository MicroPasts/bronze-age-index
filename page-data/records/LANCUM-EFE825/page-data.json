It is difficult to judge from the photograph, but the axe seems plain or might possibly have a long thin rib in the centre of each face. The loop and mouth moulding are damaged/missing and there is a long tear in the side opposite the loop. Judging from the picture this is either a long narrow variant of a Yorkshire three-ribbed axe or a variant of Type Everthorpe, both of which are socketed axe types of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage of Late Bronze Age Britain. \nFind not seen by FLO; photograph of find kindly supplied by finder.","fourFigureLat":"53.89189623","fourFigureLon":"-2.26015381","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"April 30, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dot Boughton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Middop","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dboughton/MikeSteve386501-446903b.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lancashire County Council","length":"82"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
