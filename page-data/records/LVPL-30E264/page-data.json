The cutting edge is curved and expands slightly outwards. The edge is worn and abraded and measures 39.28mm in width. At the base of the object is a broadly sub-rectangular shaped mouth with an expanded moulded collar, measuring 39.43mm in length, 33.45mm width and 5.94mm thick. Below the mouth is a moulded collar from which a single raised line of decoration travels down the centre of the surviving side until almost the halfway point. The other side is incomplete and is missing part of the body and mouth. A single loop is positioned to the side and presents a prominent casting seam along the length of the object.\n\n\n\nThe object has a dark green patina and brown patina with patches of brighter green corrosion. Worn striations are present on the incomplete side.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 82.62mm; width 39.28mm; thickness (body) 23.7mm; weight 157.97g\n\n\n\nThe object can be dating to the Ewart Park phase of metal work which corresponds with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC. This axe is likely to date from about 1000-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.15454021","fourFigureLon":"-2.37530166","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Heather Beeton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Heather Beeton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bradwall","county":"Cheshire East","district":"Cheshire East","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/heatherbeeton/LVPL30E264.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"82.62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
