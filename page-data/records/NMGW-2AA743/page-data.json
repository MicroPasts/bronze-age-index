One upper face and most of the mouth top has broken away, whilst the loop is broken. This medium sized axe is slender in form, with slightly divergent sides, widening near the blade end to form an expanded blade with slight recurving at the edges. The casting seams down each side of the axe remain prominent, though seem to have been blunted and rounded, possibly through hammering. The axe has a rectangular cross section, though the face edges are slightly curved. Three well-defined longitudinal ribs extend from the underside of a prominent outsplayed mouth moulding, converging slightly towards the blade end. The blade edge has entirely corroded away, although hammer marks and striations on the blade bevel, parallel to the blade edge, indicate that the axe blade was prepared and sharpened for use. The axe has minor casting blemishes upon the inner socket surfaces and on one outer face, though not serious enough to affect it functioning as an axe, whilst the socket base is flat and deep. The mouth, break edges and blade edge are severely corroded, light green and powdery. When reported for identification there were a number of additional corroded small fragments, which had detached themselves from the axe. Most of the axe surfaces are original and have a good dark-brown to black patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.662493","fourFigureLon":"-3.476113","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"\nInside the socket of the axe were found well mineralised plant fragments, possibly grass stems, which were removed for study. These may have been within the socket when it was deposited within the ground.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"May 31, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ferndale","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2234.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"96.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
