The ingot would have had a diameter of 110mm and the quarter ingot has a weight of 1,140.2g, indicating an approximate weight of 4,560g for the whole ingot. This would imply a comparatively large ingot. The surface of the metal is corroded and has a pale green patina with areas of red-brown surface.","fourFigureLat":"51.457637","fourFigureLon":"-3.311162","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefact was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Analysis was able to confirm that the ingot is of pure copper with no minor elements detected. The ingot was said to have been found with another fragment of similar size but both were initially not recognised as artefacts and discarded. The copper composition is of interest since it strengthens the argument for founders having precise control over metal composition in the Late Bronze Age rather than continued recycling leading to Copper ingot are generally associated with Ewart Park metalworking (Cunliffe 1988 ) although they have been found with Llyn Fawr. Ingot fragments associated with Ewart Park metalwork are more typically c. 25-250g.
