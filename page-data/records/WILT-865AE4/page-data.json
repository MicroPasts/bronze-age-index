It is a narrow 17mm in width at the very end, which is also damaged. Its maximum thickness is 10.5mm.\nIt widens over 23mm to 20.5mm wide at the ancient break. There are casting flashes worn down but not completely at the sides, sloping on both sides off centre towards the same side. Oval indentations on both sides below the butt accentuate the wings, just beginning.\nThe patina is very dark green/ black and shiny. The fragment weighs 14.96g.\nThe narrowness of the butt end suggest this is more a Middle Bronze Age palstave than the more square types which overlap into the beginning of the Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.338741","fourFigureLon":"-1.714275","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1201","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"September 27, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Easton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/PHaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society","length":"23"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
