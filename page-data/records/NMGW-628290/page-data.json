This is a side fragment from near the blade of a socketed axe of undetermined type and dating from between 1100 and 600 BC. The fragment has a height of 32.5mm, a width of 24.3mm and a maximum thickness of 14.8mm (minimum thickness of 7.2mm). The axe was likely to have been made from a heavily-leaded bronze and the fragment weighs 51.8g. The base of the socket is visible at the top of the fragment with a surviving depth of 7.4mm. The side of the axe is slightly convex and is beginning to curve outwards at the bottom, probably implying a somewhat expanded blade edge. The casting seam is not visible on the side of the axe suggesting the axe was well-finished or used. Both faces of the axe have been heavily-battered, leaving pounding marks and partially closing the socket. The surface of the axe fragment is in good condition with a mid to dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/axecomp.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
