The fragment is 30.90mm long, with a pronounced but narrow lozenge-section midrib. The blade wings are largely complete, although one wing is bent at the cutting edge.  The width of the fragment narrows from 34.87mm to 23.89mm  towards the tip which is missing.  There is no central cavity visible within the midrib, although the terminals of the midribs are partially obscured by soil. The fragment weighs 18.58g.\n\nA lightly pitted dark brown patina is visible on a small area of one of the blade wings, but generally the fragment has a light to dark green surface colouring.  As previously mentioned, there is some obscuration of the surface by soil.\n\nIn cross-section the object is similar to known Bronze Age forms for edged blades, and particularly spear tips: a lozenge-section midrib with thin triangular wings on either side (see for example, the spearheads illustrated in Ehrenberg, 1977, figs 3ff ).  However, the majority of the object is missing, which would have the diagnostic features to enable more precise identification and dating.","fourFigureLat":"52.69657","fourFigureLon":"-1.838671","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Duncan Slarke","datefound1":"July 31, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Duncan Slarke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.39","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lichfield","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/BA Blade frag copy 2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"30.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
