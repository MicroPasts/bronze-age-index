The axehead is sub-trapezoidal with a curved blade tapering to a rounded cutting edge. The sides are slightly concaved and the axehead is undecorated. \n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark green/brown patina and is worn. The axehead is 44.8mm long, 18.3mm tapering to 4.4mm wide, 4mm thick and weighs 9.4g.\n\n\n\nThis object is too small to have functioned as an axe and current archaeological thinking suggests they played a role in votive/ritual practices or functioned as amulets. Despite the obvious lack of contemporaneity, those modelled on later Bronze Age axe types, socketed and looped, have been found in secure Iron Age and Roman contexts.","fourFigureLat":"54.22616646","fourFigureLon":"-0.65167675","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Allerston","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/MLS0008.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"44.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
