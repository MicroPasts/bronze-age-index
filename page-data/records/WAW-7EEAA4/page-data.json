The fragment that remains is an elongated trapezoidal shape in plan. The upper narrow edge is broken as the tip is missing. This break is not recent as the patina covers the break. The lower edge is also broken and again not recently. In section, at the upper edge it is a lozenge shape. This continues but the lozenge has slightly concave edges. A short portion of the socket is visible on one face of the spear. It is off-centre and therefore not positioned in the thickest portion of the spear. This damage may be due to miscasting or was later damage which revealed the fragile nature of the position of the socket. A waxy coating deposited in the socket, but this is probably a recent application. The surface of the spear has an incomplete heavy dark green patina. The spear measures 32.23mm long, 16.41mm wide and 7.61mm thick. It weighs 12.5g.\n\nThe heavy patina, and shape in section suggest this is a Bronze Age spearhead. However, as the majority of the object is missing which has the diagnostic features, such as side-loops missing the dating cannot be narrowed down further.","fourFigureLat":"52.30101","fourFigureLon":"-2.162733","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"February 23, 2005","datefound2":"February 23, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.61","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Elmbridge","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-7EEAA4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"32.23"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
