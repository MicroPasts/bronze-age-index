The incomplete axehead consists of the blade, loop and roughly half the butt end.\nThe blade has incurved long edges and an expanded cutting edge (38.7mm wide and 2.3mm thick), which has suffered some slight damage and has a shallow curve. On both faces is a prominent central mid-rib extending vertically below the stop-ridge and expanding, shallowing-out, into the lower blade. On one face it is wider and shallower, on the other narrower and higher.\n\nThe loop extends in a C-shape to the side, measuring 28.9mm in length and 11.0mm in thickness and projecting c.15mm. The casting flash is apparent both above and below the loop (where it is slightly to one side of the loop) and has been smoothed down.\n\nThe stop ridge has squared-corners and a depth on either side of c.8mm. It is 27.1mm wide and 12.7mm thick at this point (inside the flanges 8.9mm thick). At the old break (which has an H-shaped cross-section) it measures 26.2mm wide and 10.3mm thick.\nThe axehead measures 115.6mm in length, 39.0mm in max.width (across the loop), 31.4mm in max.thickness and weighs 268g (to the nearest 2g). It has a greyish-green patina with brighter green corrosion at the butt end and some pitting towards the cutting edge.","fourFigureLat":"51.55191577","fourFigureLon":"-1.16487958","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Moulsford","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP6F007F.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"115.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
