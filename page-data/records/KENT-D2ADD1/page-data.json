The flanges begin about a third of the way along the butt's length. The cleft between the flanges is raltively smother perhaps from use. There is a significant casting fault in one side of the butt, rectangular in shape. The casting seem is visible along the sides of the axehead, though some effort to reduce it appears to have taken place. The stop is pronounced and overhangs a little which accentuates the wasting effect of the blade's flare. The stop has right-angled corners with the flanges. The loop is on one side which arcs over the position on the stop. The blade is long, thin and narrow and extends extensively before flaring out at the blade end. there is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is has a heaivly modttled patination. Within the flanges it has a dark grey-green patination, towards the butt end and along the flanges it has a much lighter green-white corrosion cause by wear and corrosion. The blade end is a medium mid green colour. There are some areas of historic damage across the blade indicated by their patination.\n\n\n\nTotal Measurements: 157mm long, 39.27mm wide at the loop (26.20mm wide at stop-ridge without loop, 43.92mm wide at blade edge and 500g in weight\n\n\n\nBlade 93.6mm long, 43.89mm wide.\n\n\n\nLoop: 32.03mm long, 13.07mm high, 9.08mm thick.\n\n\n\nButt: 61.46mm long, 24.91mm wide, 32.644mm thick.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:  Burgess and Schmidt, which despite being focused on metalwork from Northern Britain has a similar types illustrated, specifically the Transitional Palstaves of Roundhay mid ribbed variety. Catalogue number 890 from Aikbrae and no 899 from Haydon Bridge are particularly close examples.","fourFigureLat":"51.28151032","fourFigureLon":"0.24976047","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"39.27","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Seal","county":"Kent","district":"Sevenoaks","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTD2ADD1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"157"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
