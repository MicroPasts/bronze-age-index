The outer cutting edges of the blades are abraded, showing a green tint against an overall brown patina, on the other side there is heavy damage with a gaping sub-triangular shaped jagged hole. No decoration is visible. The patina on the ragged side indicates that this damage might have occurred in antiquity. \n\n\n\nAn example of a similar spearhead in a better condition includes NLM-572E82 from Wrawby, North Lincolnshire.
