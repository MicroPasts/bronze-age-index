Only the butt survives; the fragment is sub-rectangular in shape. The axe has an uneven, angular butt, with sides that gradually taper towards the break. One side of the fragment has slight flanged sides, which develop close to the break, created a 'T'-shaped cross-section and both faces of the axe fragment are slightly concave. The faces of the axe show signs of wear, such as scratches and the break is patinated, suggesting that the object was broken in antiquity.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 26.2 mm in length, 22.1 mm wide, 10.7 mm thick and weighs 21.6 g. \n\n\n\nDue to the fragmentary nature of the object, it is difficult to confidently assign a Type, although the fragment does appear to be indicative of a palstave rather than a developed axe.","fourFigureLat":"51.01537053","fourFigureLon":"-1.95860828","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Chestnutt","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Chestnutt","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Broad Chalke","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILTA17D02.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"26.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
