The axehead is a South Eastern type and part of the Ewart Park metalworking assemblage. It has a round section socket and is undecorated except for a single moulded ridge around the socket apeture. There is a single integrally cast loop on the underside of the axehead and a casting seam that runs the length of the object from blade to socket on the upper side. The blade of the axe has been damaged and there are patches of corrosion across the surface. The axehead is triangular in plan, tapering to the blade which is flaired and so wider than the socket end. The object has a dark olive green/brown patina except in the places where the corrosion has occurred and it is a light green.\n\n\n\nA parallel can be found in Savory 1980 No. 184.\n\n\n\nLength: 81.02mm\n\nWidth of Blade: 38.37mm\n\nThickness at mid point: 23.19mm\n\nWeight: 131g\n\nDiameter of Socket: 36.45mm\n\n\n\nRef: Savory, H.N. 1980, A Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections, National Museum of Wales: Cardiff","fourFigureLat":"51.68799042","fourFigureLon":"0.15411415","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edwin Wood","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"36.45","edge":null,"thickness":"23.19","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stapleford Tawney","county":"Essex","district":"Epping Forest","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/AxeheadSUSSE33637.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"81.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
