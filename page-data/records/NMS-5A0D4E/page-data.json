The mouth of the socket has become squashed and broken (and the breaks worn). Approximately half of the mouth is missing to a depth of 16 to 20mm. Another quarter of similar depth is detached but extant, while the fourth quarter is in-situ and integral. The detached fragment fits back onto the axehead well, in a position opposite and squashed against the integral quarter. Both parts are thickened at the rim and their shape indicates that the mouth was originally oval.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is sub-rectangular in transverse cross-section (rounded corners and slightly convex faces). In width, it tapers concavely from the mouth to the centre and then expands concavely to the lateral tips of the curved cutting edge.  In thickness, it expands convexly from the mouth to a point about a third of the way along of its length (mainly or wholly due to having been squashed) and then tapers convexly from there until it terminates in a point at the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nThe two narrow faces each bear a longitudinal casting seam, and one bears a loop, which is biconvex in cross-section and situated close to the mouth. A small fragment of the cutting edge has been lost from a worn break near its centre. The whole object is patinated bright green. 10th to 8th century BC\n\n\n\nLength: 97.4mm. Width (at cutting edge): 50.8mm. Thickness at centre (broad face to broad face): 22.2mm. Thickness of rim: 5.4mm.
