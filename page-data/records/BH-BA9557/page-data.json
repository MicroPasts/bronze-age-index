Two C-shaped notches, located below this upper portion, mark the points at which the now-missing handle plates would have been attached. The widest point is at the shoulders, beneath which the concave sides angle inwards, smoothly extending into the parallel-sided blade. This blade is of lozenge-shaped cross section and has been broken in antiquity. The piece has a mid to dark brown surface patina (slightly pitted in places) which suggests deposition within a damp environment.\n\n\n\nLength: 81.8mm; width: 31.7mm; thickness: 4.4mm. Weight: 34.01g.\n\n\n\nThis rapier forms part of a dispersed group of Middle to Late Bronze Age metalwork found to the north of Faringdon and concentrated on the northern side of the River Thames. Close parallels include a complete (albeit broken) rapier (GLO-036A39) and pieces of two further such implements (SUR-A18104/Treasure case 2015 T331). All of these rapiers are of similar form, being of Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV (1981) and dating to the period c. 1500-c. 1150 BC. Other similarly dated implements from the area include razors (see SUR-D8D06E and LEIC-081BB1), a disc-headed pin (SUR-1EFCC6), a socketed axe (WILT-A30E3C), socketed spearheads (WILT-1F3709, BERK-2CF486, BERK-2D0061, BERK-4D4F74) and a palstave (BERK-CD4525).","fourFigureLat":"51.70699339","fourFigureLon":"-1.58171638","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julian Watters","datefound1":"October 03, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julian Watters","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clanfield","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jwatters/BA_rapier_15_145_2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"St. Albans District Council","length":"81.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
