The butt (with a width of 18.4mm) has broken across one side. The sides are straight and near-parallel, diverging slightly as far as the stop (with a width of 20mm to 25.1mm at the stop). The sides are then concave and divergent to produce a comparatively wide blade. The blade is asymmetric, seemingly differentially worn or damaged on one side (with a blade width of 64.2mm). The casting seams are clearly discernible on both sides but have been neatly finished, surviving as a ridge where the surface is preserved. The flanges begin (9mm) beneath the butt and appear to be damaged and truncated. The more complete flange appears to be moderately straight, reaching its highest point beneath the stop (with a maximum surviving height of 30.4mm). The septum (with a thickness of 8.0mm) is flat across its length and has a slight concavity across its width. The stops appear more rounded on one face than the other (with heights of 8.6mm and 11.7mm). There is a bevel from the stop to the blade faces (where the blade has a thickness of 20.0mm) and the top of the faces is decorated with a subtle depression or sunken shield decoration but is without mouldings. The blade faces are flat and gradually convergent, increasing in convergence near the edge but without a discernible blade facet. The blade edge is comparatively straight. The surface has surviving remnants of a very dark, near-black patina and elsewhere has a pale to mid-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe general form of the palstave would seem to suit Type Wantage, although the absence of decorative mouldings would make the axe a variant of the type. The features would seem 'developed' for an unlooped palstave and if the loop represents a typological progression , this axe may be seen as at the cusp.\n\n\n\n1.
