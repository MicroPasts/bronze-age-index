Only the cutting edge remains; the fragment is hollow and has a triangular section. Corrosion of the copper-alloy has resulted in a patchy pale green patina and the edges of the axe head fragment are worn and chipped. The edge of the break is rough and jagged. Unfortunately not enough remains of the axe head to be able to identity it more precisely or attribute a closer date. The length of the fragment is 33.88mm, its width is 45.77mm and the maximum thickness of the fragment is 13.69mm. The weight of the socketed axe head fragment is 64.00g","fourFigureLat":"53.94009431","fourFigureLon":"-0.79802777","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss.
