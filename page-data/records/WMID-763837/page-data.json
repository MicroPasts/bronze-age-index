At this widest section the palstave measures 27.06 mm in width.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The flanges have suffered some damaged at the edges. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 26.38 mm in width and 6.12 mm thick. No side loop is present.\n\n\n\nBeneath the stop-ridge descends a vertical rib that extends to the mid point on the upper blade. The blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical. The original surface is damaged. The cutting edge measures 59.11 mm in width and is 14.05 mm thick which includes the rib.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.\n\n\n\nEarly Midribbed Palstaves belongs to the Acton Park metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. This example is similar to Group II - Early Midribbed Type Chepstow; similar to an example from Kilnoterie, Scotland (p127 cat no 794 plate 58, No. 789). \n\n\n\nThere are other axeheads of the Early Palstave Group II - Early Mid-ribbed Type recorded on the PAs database and discovered in Warwickshire such as WAW-245FB6 and WMID-7493D3. \n\n\n\nOverall the palstave measures 150.8 mm in length, a maximum width of 59.11 mm at the cutting edge, and a maximum thickness near the stop ridge of 27.06 mm. It weighs 292.3 g.\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P. K. and Burgess, C. B., 1981. The axes of Scotland and Northern England Munchen : C.H.
