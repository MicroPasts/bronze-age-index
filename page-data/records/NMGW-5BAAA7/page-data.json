The mouth is comparatively square with an external width (between sides) of 37.0mm (27.9mm internal) and breadth (between faces) of 34.1mm (25.8mm internal). The socket has a depth of 72.4mm with no evidence of internal ribs. The mouth is uneven and appears to have had a prominent rounded mouth moulding. The axe has a weaker moulding beneath the mouth. The loop springs from the top of the lower moulding, and had a length of 22.2mm. The sides of the axe are straight and parallel, until they approach the blade, where they diverge to produce a moderately expanded blade edge. The blade edge is moderately curved with a slightly eroded width of 36.0mm. The unlooped side has a slight angle across its thickness and the casting seam is just about evident. There is no discernible decoration on the faces. The axe currently has much of the surface surviving with a mid brown patina. The surface however is deteriorating and is powdery to the touch with areas of active bronze corrosion beneath.","fourFigureLat":"51.630435","fourFigureLon":"-3.836293","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"South Eastern type axes are often associated with the Carp's Tongue complex of North West France (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 217), which heavily influences hoard composition in Lowland England. The type is also well represented throughout Britain and is present in the Llantwit tradition of south east Wales, represented within the eponymous hoard and elsewhere.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Briton Ferry","county":"Neath Port Talbot","district":"Neath Port Talbot","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20061831.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"86.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
