The fragment comprises most of the handle. It has marginal ribs running down its edges and two circular perforations. One is filled with iron corrosion. This suggests that this fragment might be dated to the cusp between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (c. 600BC). The handle has an expanded, flared terminal, which tapers to a convex-sided grip. The blade-end of the handle is incomplete, but the 'break' is very neat and linear, and possibly suggests that it was intentionally cut in antiquity. The section of the break bears the same mid-green patina with patches of brown staining.\n\n\n\nIn section, the handle is 'H'-shaped, and when viewed from the side the lips of the 'H' widen towards the middle. The body of the handle thickens at this point also, and a circular rivet hole is located in the centre.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the object is smooth and has a mid-green patina with patches of brown staining. The sides of the flared terminal both have what appears to be a shallow ridge of casting running along the centre. The butt-end is rounded.","fourFigureLat":"53.30769963","fourFigureLon":"-0.51569156","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"November 01, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welton","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"69"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
