On the upper and lower surface there is a raised casting flash, following a seam along the length of the object. The object narrows from 30.7mm to 18.6mm in width where it terminates in a rectangular break measuring 18.6mm x 11.5mm. To one of the sides, just below the mouth, is a 22.1mm long loop. The object has a dark green patina with a lighter green pitted surface, and a small patch of original patina survives around the loop.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is 86.6mm in length, 30.7mm in width, 29.5 thickness, and weighs 127.68g.\n\n\n\nIt could possibly be a MBA axe of Taunton Hademarschen type:\n\n\n\nOn record WILT-C4C954 Brendan O'Connor comments there is a small group of similar slender socketed axeheads from East Dorset (A Group of Middle Bronze Age Socketed Axes from East Dorset, Brendan O'Connor and Peter J. Woodward, PDNHAS 125, 2003, 144-6), and another in the Salisbury hoard. More recently one has turned up on the Isle of Wight in a hoard of Taunton phase palstaves (Treasure Annual Reoprt 2003, p. 197), confirming the Middle Bronze Age date and distribution. The Marlborough example is a little further north.","fourFigureLat":"51.22761103","fourFigureLon":"-1.08483314","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helena Costas","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helena Costas","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cliddesden","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/helenacostas/BERK897467.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"86.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
