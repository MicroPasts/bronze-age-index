The cutting edge is worn and rounded. It is wider than the rest of the axe; the sides curve inwards. The casting seams are visible on the edges, but they have been smoothed. The break is also patinated suggesting the axe has been broken in the ground for a long time. The patination on the inside of the socket is darker. On the outside, the smooth olive green patina survives in places, but patches are missing showing lighter coloured corroded metal beneath.
