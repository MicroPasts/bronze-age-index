The butt is straight, now worn to a slight angle (with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 5mm). The sides are near parallel, very gently convex (reaching a width of 23.5mm above the loop and a width of 20.8mm at the stop). The loop has been lost but the stubs indicate that it was positioned either side of the stop (with a length of 25mm and internal length of 9mm). The sides of the blade are gently curved and divergent, producing a moderately expanded blade edge with prominent curve (with a blade width of 37.4mm). The casting seams are raised and discernible on both sides but were neatly finished. The sides are appear to have been flat across the depths above the stop but convex on the blade. The flanges have been truncated but the better preserved flange appears to have been straight, gradually rising from the butt to the stop (with a maximum surviving thickness at the stop of 24.0mm. The stop has a gentle curve and near-vertical sides, perpendicular to the septum. The septum is moderately concave across its width and flat across its length. Both faces are ribbed, with a prominent midrib, flanked on each side with weaker ribs, positioned near but not at the sides. The ribs appear to have extended all the way along the blade to a blade facet. A single blade facet is evident on the blade. The surface is corroded but has mid to dark-green patina where it survives.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has a number of unusual features; Type Roundhay palstaves are generally smaller but this example is unusually small and also the three-rib decoration arrangement is difficult to parallel. The form is broadly consistent with Transitional Palstaves and specifically of Type Roundhay.\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
