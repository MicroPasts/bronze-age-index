The object is trapezoidal in shape and sub-rectangular in cross-section. One end of the plate consists of a narrow sub-rectangular shank with a broken terminal. From here the plate gradually widens and flattens with concave outer edges to form a wide terminal with a narrow rounded edge. The upper and lower surfaces are plain and undecorated, though the entire object is covered by a green patina. The object measures 26mm in length. The narrow terminal measures 7mm in width and 7mm in thickness, while the wider thinner end is 18mm in width and 4.5mm in thickness. The object weighs 15.29 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.0532968","fourFigureLon":"-0.17841006","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"42","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"February 24, 2016","datefound2":"February 24, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ashwell","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"North Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/MiniAxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
