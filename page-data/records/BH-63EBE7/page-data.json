The fragment comprises a small portion of the blade and the tang. The blade is missing its tip but is lentoidal in section. The edges of the blade are either missing or heavily corroded. The tang extends from the blade and is approximately trapezoidal in plan. The remains of a hemispherical section rib are visible on both the upper and lower surfaces of the tang. The fragment measures 49mm in length, a maximum of 25mm in width and a maximum of 7mm in thickness.\n\n\n\nTwo small fragments of copper-alloy waste/slag were found at the same findspot. They measure:\n\n\n\na) 22mm in length, 16mm in width, 8mm in thickness and weighing 7.4g.\n\n\n\nb) 23mm in length, 21mm in width, 8mm in thickness and weighing 7.86g.\n\n\n\nThe dagger is similar to BH-2DF409 and LANCUM-EDDE97 which both date from 1300 to 1150BC. This fragment with its pronounced midrib resembles both daggers and might therefore belong to the Penard phase, too, dating to the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age 1300-1150 BC. It would be a smaller bladed/pointy weapin, i.e. a Ballintober type dagger - the term 'Ballintober type' normally referring to swords. Most British Ballintober swords come from the Thames Valley and a small number was found in South West England and South Wales.","fourFigureLat":"51.79711553","fourFigureLon":"0.08679681","fromdate":"1300","todate":"1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philippa Walton","datefound1":"January 01, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philippa Walton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"3","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gilston","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"East Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH63EBE7B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"49"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
