It consists of the hilt, with the remnants of two rivet holes, with a short length of the blade.  On one side, the rivet holes are delineated by a circular cast ring, surrounding the holes. The surface has a dark green patina with brown staining.  This dagger is perhaps typical of the Penard phase of the Bronze Age (1275 BC to c. 1140 BC). It is very similar to a Grp III rapier, or more likely, a dirk.\n\n\n\nA similar item can be seen at - WMID-D54E37","fourFigureLat":"51.54448457","fourFigureLon":"-1.42458361","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"September 05, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.61","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wantage","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/DSCN6865.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"41.46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
