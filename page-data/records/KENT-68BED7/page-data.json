It is long, tapering and narrowing, with a very high angular midrib flanked by moulded channels. The fragment is very warped and bent, typical of intentional 'killed' bronze age objects, leaving it almost S-shaped in profile. On one side of the edge there is another possible intentional bend. The break at the point and towards the butt end are both jagged but worn and patinated. At the butt end break it is shown to be hollow indicating it would have been socketed. The fragment is patinated a dark brown colour with very sparse tiny green speckles. There is a red concretion in parts of the moulded midrib channel.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 95.96mm long, 20.35mm wide (at widest remaining), 9.86mm thick (at thickest remaining point) and 33.23g in weight.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments 'Most Bronze Age spearheads are classified by blade shape or socket arrangements - so without those [there will be some uncertainty in classifying this example]. The blade is very large - given that this is just the upper part - so [dating cannot be narrowed further] than very late MBA (III) or LBA - Wilburton, Blackmoor / Ewart Park. so 1200-750. The blade though is very narrow and has a high mid-rib as well as raised flanking mouldings so would guess it is either a Davis Group 9 (1100 -975) Group 16 Lunate blade opening (1100- 800) or a Group 17 channelled blade (950-750). [It is likely that this fragment represents] the top 1/3 of the spearhead, [so when complete would have been a] massive one.\n\n\n\nMatt Knight (pers. comms.) from National Museum Scotland has pointed out that the deformation of this object is certainly intentional and occurred when the object was heated, becoming plastic and then struck with a hammer causing some breakage but also the aforementioned deformation. This heated damage also explains why the breaks are not as jagged as one would expect from a cold break.","fourFigureLat":"52.0221296","fourFigureLon":"0.53454026","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.86","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Yeldham","county":"Essex","district":"Braintree","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT68BED7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"95.96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
