The blade fragment is rectangular in plan, with parallel long edges, that narrow to terminate in a blunted point. It has a lozenge shaped (lentoid) cross section with a raised central rib that tapers slightly in width and terminates at the tip of the blade. The remainder of the rapier (upper blade and hilt) is now missing. The surfaces have a dark green coloured polished patina which is abraded in places. The blade fragment has been bent midway though its length; the lack of stress fractures in the surface patina suggest this could be post depositional deliberate damage. c. 1500 - 1150 BC.\n\n\n\nThe rapier fragment measures 103.25mm in length, 21.01mm in maximum width, 5.51mm in thickness, and weighs 36.90g.","fourFigureLat":"51.138007","fourFigureLon":"1.029081","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"\nFinder/recorder name obfuscated and shown as Kent FLO for site security.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"August 27, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.51","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stowting","county":"Kent","district":"Shepway","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/louis3/1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"103.25"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
