Almost the entire butt end is missing (old break), making it difficult to determine its original length. It has the remains of one side loop (old break).\n\nThe long edges of the blade flare gently in a straight line, subtly expanding just above the curved cutting edge which has suffered some damage (now worn but leaving indents along the edge). The blade is 27.7mm wide just below the loop and increases to a width of 41.8mm at the cutting edge. Just above the loop is the stop ridge, deeper than it is wide (27.8mm wide x 33.7mm deep). From this and extending longitudinally at the centre of both faces, is a ridge-like moulding (rather than a defined mid-rib), which shallows-out towards the cutting edge.\n\nThe remains of the loop measure 10.6mm in length, 7.0mm in width and 8.2mm in thickness. It is oval in cross-section. Extending from the base of the loop to the cutting edge and slightly more towards one face than the other is the remains of a worn casting flash. This is also apparent to the opposite side of the axehead, again leaning slightly more to one face than the other.\n\nThe stop ridge is convex to front and back while its side edges are straight; in cross-section it forms an 'H'. The depth between ridge and face of the butt end is 10.8mm to one side and 12.8mm to the other. The flanges are of uneven thicknesses: with the loop facing left and looking at the stop ridge from above (in cross-section) the flange on the bottom right measures 5.9mm, the top right measures 4.5mm, the bottom left measures 5.1mm and the top left is missing. The remains of the face measures 9.7mm thick and c.6mm in length.\n\nThe incomplete palstave measures 98.0mm in length, 41.8mm in max.width, 33.7mm in max.thickness and weighs 304g (to the nearest 2g).
