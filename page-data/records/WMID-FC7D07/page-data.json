The object has a flared, sub-triangular terminal which appears to have been the working end. From here the object tapers to the handle, which flattens out and widens adjacent to the chisel end of the tool. The object then terminates in a worn break. The tool has no decorative features and has a mid to light green patina.\n\n\n\nComparable objects can be seen in Leahy and Lewis (2018: 221-222), where more complete examples from Barnham in Kent and Swinfen and Packington in Staffordshire have been cited.
