The socket of the axe is sub square, with an irregular mouth. The socket is 44.8 mm deep. The top edge of the socket shows little evidence of casting jets that have been trimmed flush with the socket mouth. A raised band (9.6 mm deep) is present at the level of the top of the loop beyond to the mouth of the socketed axe. The loop is well preserved and relatively small and wide with a irregular lentoid shaped cross section. It measures 14.0 mm in length and 5.4 mm wide. It is positioned below the raised band.The horizontal cast moulding is present on both faces and the edges of the axe; however this is better preserved on one face. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade.The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion. Here a lighter green area can be seen, predominately around the blade edge, socket and the edge of the loop. These areas of exposed metal should be monitored for signs of active corrosion (bright greeny powdery residue). To reduce the risk of this occurring, the axe head should be stored in an dry acid-free environment, such as a sealed tupperware box, with silica gel and acid free tissue paper.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures  65.7 mm in length, 25.5 mm wide (at the socket), 31.4 mm wide (at the cutting edge), is 24.4 mm thick (socket) and 3.7 mm thick (cutting edge). It weighs 70.5 grams. \n\n\n\nTwo similar socketed axes have been published as no 28 (probably from East Anglia) and 31 (Oundle, Northamptonshire) in Watson (1993, 6). These are considered to be Late Bronze Age in dating (Needham Period 7, c. 950 BC to c. 700 BC).\n\n\n\nReference:\n\nWatson, P. 1993.
