The object is now folded in two and the band has corroded. It is possible that it has broken but in its current condition it is also possible it was a penannular design. It has a D shape section band and there is no visible decoration to the surface, the copper alloy has a dark olive green patination. When complete the bracelet would have been quite small in diameter. The band is a relatively regular width and thickness along its length, save for a small area where corrosion has narrowed the band considerably. A Bronze Age date is possible based on its context, close to other finds of prehistoric date.\n\n\n\nLength: 75.07mm\nWidth: 4.92mm\nThickness: 2.43mm\nWeight: 12.35g","fourFigureLat":"51.4770308","fourFigureLon":"-0.1294578","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dick Read","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.43","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Oval","county":"Greater London Authority","district":"Lambeth","regionName":"London","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwood/braceletLONFD49EB.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"75.07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
