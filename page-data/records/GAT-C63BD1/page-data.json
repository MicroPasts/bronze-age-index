It belongs to the phase I classification of types  (c. 2500 – 1450 B.C.) in Savoury’s Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections of the National Museum of Wales and appears to be of Migdale tradition.  It is not one of the earliest types of axe due to the flared blade and central thickening, which were improvements on the earliest types.\n\nThe convex blade is splayed on either side by roughly 10mm and the butt is slightly rounded.  Across the axehead run concentric ridges mimicking the shape of the blade.  The cutting edge remains quite sharp although the outer surface has flaked away in some places since discovery.\n\nThe longitudinal section is lozengic, created by a slight transverse median ridge and tapered ends.  This thickening at the centre was an attempt to prevent the blade from moving in the handle and ultimately damaging it.\n\nThe axehead is not symmetrical and may have been hammered at some time as there appear to be some marks on the pitted surface.  The patina remains across the majority of the object and is brown in colour, although there appears to be some surface decay.  Despite this, the axehead is in good condition.","fourFigureLat":"53.151952","fourFigureLon":"-4.244556","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Nina Steele","datefound1":"September 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Nina Steele","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Caernarfon","county":"Gwynedd","district":"Gwynedd","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/nsteele/PRN 24019-002.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Gwynedd Archaeological Trust","length":"97.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
