The palstave has a narrow form and is parallel sided at the rear, extending as far as the beginning of the blade. The blade sides gradually diverge to a point corresponding to a blade facet on the face, after which it expands into wide blade producing a deep crescentic blade edge. Remnants of the casting seams are visible on both sides. The butt is concave and the flanges at the rear of the axe are straight as far as immediately before the straight stop. The blade thickness is shallower than the flanges, producing a gradient from the blade to the stop. The stop on one face extends beyond the height of the flanges. The sides of the face on the blade have low flange extensions, which continue as far as the blade facet, as does the single rib on each face.","fourFigureLat":"53.399277","fourFigureLon":"-4.468163","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-1350","notes":"Dating early palstaves remains problematic, Norhtover (forthcoming) has stated that Group II palstaves belong to the earlier stages of Acton Park (or Acton Park 1), and Needham (1996) argues that no true metalwork assemblage can be defined as Acton Park 1 and groups Acton Park 2 with Taunton in his Period 5 (1500-1150 BC), Needham's (1996) C14 dating of a broad-bladed shield pattern palstave, however, was dated to 1 sigma to 1610-1420 BC (OXA -4651). Northover (forthcoming) notes the composition of some Liswerry palstaves, including Liswerry itself produced signatures consistent with Taunton phase metalworking (c. 1350-1200 BC) The distribution of early midribbed palstaves in Wales and the Marches is generally south eastern in contrast to a mainly northern distribution of shield pattern palstaves.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"May 31, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"33.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanbadrig","county":"Isle of Anglesey","district":"Isle of Anglesey","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1421.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"151"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
