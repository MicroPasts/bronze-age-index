The gouge is of circular mouth section and has a low-raised collar, which is very slightly concave and is 10mm deep from the mouth. The casting seams are prominent on both sides and are likely to have been finished by hammering. The sides are straight and diverge slightly at the blade. Sharpening striations are visible on both of the blade faces. The striations are angled across the blade, towards the sides on the front (gouged) face, and are positioned along the blade circumference on the (circular) back face. Inside the socket at the mouth are two incised or possibly cast lines; one on the rim and the other 2.5mm into the socket. The gouge is in good condition, with only a little damage to the blade edge, and has a dark brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"David Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class IIa category, which is characterised by a deep collar and narrow blade. Classes of gouges are difficult to distinguish chronologically, but can be broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age, particularly the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (c.1150-750 BC), though different forms continue in use into the Early Iron Age. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a similar collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cowbridge with Llanblethian","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/dscn2255.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"75.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
