Most of the socket is missing due to a break. The cutting edge is C-shaped in cross-section exapanding in to the socketed oval cross section at the break. The gouge hollow is C-shaped in section and both narrows and reduces in depth as it extends further away from the cutting edge. According to Pearce (1983:43), socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart Park phase of between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.93045132","fourFigureLon":"-1.30331237","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.2","discoveryContext":"Chance find during metal detecting","parish":"Middle Aston","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/oxpas2016434.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"29.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
