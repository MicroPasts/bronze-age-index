The ring weighs 15.51g, measures 25.7mm in diameter (21.1mm internal diameter) and is 7.9mm thick. It is circular in shape with a 2.2mm wide rib running around the circumference. The interior surface features a circumferential ridge, to give a lozenge-shaped cross-section. Both edges are flanked by a 1.3mm wide rib. The object has a very smooth, shiny dark brown patina.\n\nA ring with similar decoration recorded on this database is WILT-1A5240, of which the author writes 'Similar rings have been discovered in a number of Bronze Age hoards and have been suggested as horse harness fittings, as being part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron of Class A1 (Type Tul-na-cross) and Class B1 (Types Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg) (Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g), or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire'.","fourFigureLat":"51.22073082","fourFigureLon":"-1.41430842","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"25.7","edge":null,"thickness":"7.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hurstbourne Priors","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP6F9658.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
