It is broken into two pieces, but the break is partially patinated and the object is otherwsie almost complete.\n\n\n\nThe socket below the blade is 66.6mm in length; it has a width of 10.8mm broadening to 12.3mm at the base. It weighs 30.2g. The socket is hollow for at least 50mm, and extends into the blade with a ridged mid rib extending to the tip. The blade is narrow in shape with smooth oval edges. There are the remains of cast loops, one on each side, halfway down the socket. Above the loops the shaft narrows before widening to form the base of the blade.  It measures 34.1mm in length, 10.6mm in  width, 5.8mm in thickness and weighs 10.16g. \n\n\n\nDavis describes spearheads from the earlier MBA as those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket. He dates these to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC. (Classified as type 6).\n\n\n\nRef: Later Prehistoric Finds Group : Object Datasheet No.5 , Richard Davis PhD, A Short Guide to Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads.","fourFigureLat":"54.12584779","fourFigureLon":"-2.04739907","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Diane Gourley","datefound1":"April 05, 2021","datefound2":"April 05, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Diane Gourley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kettlewell with Starbotton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR91F965BronzeAgeSpear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"66.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
