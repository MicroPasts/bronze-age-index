Both items have irregular and very worn surfaces.\n\nThe larger piece measures 33mm in length, 26mm in width and 9mm in thickness.  The piece has an irregular flat base and a slightly concave inner with a raised crescentric lip.  The lip is in the form of a channel, and may have been formed by either pouring into or spilling out of the casting chamber.  The flattish base would support this too.\n\nThe smaller piece measures 24mm in length, 14mm in width, and 8mm in thickness.","fourFigureLat":"52.87484","fourFigureLon":"-0.411641","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"1699","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Folkingham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"South Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN2505B.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
