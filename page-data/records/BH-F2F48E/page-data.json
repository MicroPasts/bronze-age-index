The fragment is long, retaining the corner of the mouth moulding and a smaller moulding below. The surfaces are very worn and slightly pitted. There may be a fragmentary loop/break left on one side. The fragment is too small to determine type and metalwork assemblage, but it's likely to be a Late Bronze Age axe, possibly of South Eastern type,","fourFigureLat":"51.96614523","fourFigureLon":"-1.25909308","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julian Watters","datefound1":"December 01, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dot Boughton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Souldern","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jwatters/BA_gouge_15_172_18.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"St. Albans District Council","length":"35.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
