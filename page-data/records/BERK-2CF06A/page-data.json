The pin has a globular head with flat, indented top. Below the head is a slightly swollen collar decorated with two circumferential lines of simple incised linear scores of shirt length, arrange vertically around the pin. The shaft of the pin then tapers slowly with a sub-circular section into the almost rectangular terminal, which appears to be missing the very tip. The pin has been bent round and is now penannular; this may have been purposeful and reused as a bracelet. The pin does have similarities with an example of Cool's (1990:170) Class 24 pins of probably second century AD date, however identations on pin heads are seen throughout the Iron Age too. This pin does share similarities to Early and Middle Iron Age 'cup-headed pins' however examples of this period display a deeper cup than seen on the example recorded here. The patina, head style and otherwise simple form and decoration of this pin does suggest an early date - possibly Middle Bronze Age (1400-1250 BC) through to the Middle Iron Age (to c. 400 BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.66143571","fourFigureLon":"-1.4375616","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-400","notes":"Picardy type pins are dated from the early Taunton phase of the Bronze Age and according to the most recent interpretations probably go out of use by the Renard phase, giving a date range of between c.1400 and 1250 BC (Roberts, 2007: 141). These pins are still very rare along the Atlantic seabord although there are two others known from Suffolk and at least one from Norfolk, but in general they seem confined to southern and south-eastern Britain.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"August 22, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"10.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/oxpas2016377.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"65.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
