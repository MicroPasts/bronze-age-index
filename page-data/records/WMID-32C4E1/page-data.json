The fragment is sub rectangular in plan, and triangular in section. The socket is rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are faintly present along both of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at the sides. Filemarks are present on the front and back of the axehead.\n\n\nThe socketed axehead fragment measures 74.37 mm in length, 35.61 mm wide (at the blade), 29.20 mm wide (at the body), 18.53 mm thick (at the body), 2.11 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 27.59 mm deep. The sides are 3.20 mm thick. It weighs 89.0 g.\n\n\nThe socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.","fourFigureLat":"52.858249","fourFigureLon":"-2.239072","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eccleshall","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-32C4E1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"74.37"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
