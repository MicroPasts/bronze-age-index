(Rowlands 1976: 45). It has a sub-rectangular mouth with a narrow collar moulding, the sides of the hammer taper gently from the mouth towards a rectangular working face. There is no evidence of it having any loop. That working face has been well used with the typical side/edge protuberances from that use. There is a thick casting seem running along the length of both narrow sides and the narrow collar is fritted around the edge.\n\n\n\nThe inner dimensions of the socket at the collar are - 17.3 mm x 15.4 mm with the wall thickness at that point varying from 2.38 mm to approximately 3.6 mm and the base measures 19.97 x 15.9mm The surface has a dark green bronze patina with some corrosion scars to the edges.\n\n\n\nA similar type can be found at - IOW-8B13A7 & IOW-A05DE6","fourFigureLat":"51.16796372","fourFigureLon":"-1.7439355","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Amesbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BAaxe01.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"71.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
