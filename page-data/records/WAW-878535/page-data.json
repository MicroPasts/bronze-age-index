The razor has a leaf-shaped blade with the side edges forming the cutting edges. There is a slight central mid-rib on one face, running the length of the blade. Usually this mid-rib is quite prominent, but this is not the case on this example. In profile, the blade is bent at one tip at 45 Â°. Protruding from one tip is an integral rectangular sectioned tang. The tang tapers and the tip is curled. The surface of the razor is just developing a slight green/brown coloured patina. One face has more patina on the surface than the other, but there is no active corrosion. The razor measures 107.9mm long, 33.2mm wide and the thickness of the tang is 2.9mm. It weighs 28.16g. \n\nBronze Age razors were first classified by Hodges (1956) as Class IV, a possibly derivative of Class I.","fourFigureLat":"52.157188","fourFigureLon":"-1.855243","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Warwickshire","district":"","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-878535 drawing.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Candy Stevens","length":"107.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
