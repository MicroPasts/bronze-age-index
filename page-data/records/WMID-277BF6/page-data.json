The blade tapers towards either edge. The edges to the top and bottom are old, pre depostional breaks. No evidence of rivet holes are present at the top of the blade fragment. No decoration is present on either the front or back of the blade.\n\n\nIt measures 62.34 mm in length, has a maximum width of 22.69 mm and a minimum of 14.43 mm. It is 2.82 mm thick in the centre of the blade and 1.06 mm thick along the blade edges. It weighs 11.6 g.\n\n\nThe blade fragment is a mid to dark brown colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has been removed in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze diseases) occurring. This would be a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue and silica gel.","fourFigureLat":"52.903393","fourFigureLon":"-1.897374","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"Comment from Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO): As for the blade fragment - from the  size I think you are looking at either a large dagger or probably more likely a rapier fragment. The hilt would have been trapezoidal - and it has lost its rivets and upper part - it has also lost the shoulders but you can then see the blade thickening away from the hilt to for the mid rib. I expect the other end continued for maybe 1/3 again as the rib is parallel even if the sides aren't due to plough roll. \n\n\nSimilar rapiers have been dated to the later Middle Bronze Age (MBA III - specifically the Penard phase / industry) - Rowlands 1976 p68-70) which corresponds with Needham's Period 5 (1500-1150 CAL BC).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"February 03, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.82","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Uttoxeter","county":"Staffordshire","district":"East Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-277BF6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"62.34"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
