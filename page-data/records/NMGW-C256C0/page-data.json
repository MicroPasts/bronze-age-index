The break has occurs in antiquity across the thickest surviving part of the axe (where the axe has a width of 27mm and a thickness of 7.3mm). The sides are worn and corroded but appear to have been straight and divergent but widening more sharply at the blade. The blade tips have been lost (giving the blade a surviving width of 40.8mm). Both blade faces are gently convex across their width and flat across their lengths, before narrowing more sharply at a poorly defined blade facet. The original blade edge has been lost but now has a comparatively deep curve. The surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-green patina with areas of bright-green active corrosion. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the object makes any definite identification difficult and typological identification more problematic. The general form, with a lack of developed features and straight, divergent sides are broadly consistent with Type Migdale axes, dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2200 – 1900BC). Metallurgical Analysis was undertaken by Mary Davis[3], with three readings taken from a micro-sample and analysed by Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy; minor and trace element analysis is included; although possibly inaccurate, particularly when below 0.1%, but give an indication of presence and absence, which researchers are finding significant for analyses of Early Bronze Age material. The results indicate a tin-bronze with significant trace elements of zinc and lead.
