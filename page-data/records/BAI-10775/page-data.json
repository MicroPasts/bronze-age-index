TQ 377\", and aligned under the \"377\", \"393\". I'm not sure if this is a grid reference. Although the Site doesn't say \"25 North End\", but just \"North End\", the circumstances mention that specific address. I wasn't sure whether to enter that info. in the Site address. The Site didn't say \"England\" either, but I have added that because I have seen it done that way on most other cards. I transcribed Context into Associations. Note - I haven't always included the  Context code as well as the words on some previous cards - sorry. I transcribed Typology, Manufacture, Condition into Description. I transcribed Surface into Surface, but I think some of it may relate to patina. I transcribed the Metallurgy - Analyst bit (I assume BM Res. Lab. stands for British Museum Research Laboratory)   into Composition. (I put this bit in in Remarks on an earlier card, but Composition seems more appropriate). Boxes at bottom right of card contains some info: Rec. \"SN .Feb '81\", Sub.Inf. \"Miss Chewter 27/10/80 (& Fiona Marsden, Lewes)\", unlabelled box \"RSO 27/10/80\", Source \"Sb.A.\". There are also ticks in boxes labelled PIF, DF, SI and CI.,  PS do we transcribers ever get any feedback if we are doing it all wrong?","composition":"Metallurgy - Analyst BM Res. Lab.
