Davis Group 10, 'protected looped'. Only one side (wing) of the leaf shaped blade survives, and the tip is missing. The centre rib is circular in section and hollow (socketed). The lower edge of the blade is rounded, though this is emphasised by also being bent. There is a carefully made hole through the wing next to the rib at the base. The hole has corroded edges and its original shape is not clear. It has a D shaped (in plan and section) cast raised flange on the side opposite the rib, on both faces. The spear has a grey green patina with corrosion where the original surface is missing. The breaks are also patinated. Compare BH-16AD90, LEIC-96FB06, BERK-2CF486 and DOR-FD69C8. Davis (2017) notes that spearheads of this type, with 'small loops in the lower quartile of the blade, adjacent to the midrib' belonged to the same range of 'generally larger' spearheads with basal loops, and 'were current in the Taunton and Penard phases', about 1400 – 1125 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.838391","fourFigureLon":"-0.542582","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kevin Leahy","datefound1":"September 23, 2011","datefound2":"September 23, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.91","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishop Burton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1621_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"116.54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
