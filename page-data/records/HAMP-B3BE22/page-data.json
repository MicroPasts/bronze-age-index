At this point there is a slight imitative stop ridge on both faces. The flanges are low (c.1mm high), extending from below the butt end and tapering out as the sides curve into the cutting edge. The butt end is narrow and thin (6.3x0.9mm) with a slight convex curve and possibly a small area of damage at one corner. The cutting edge has a more pronounced curve, is 14.8mm wide and 0.8mm thick at the very edge. In profile, the object is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval. The max. thickness is at the centre of the object, where it is 3.8mm thick. The sides expand to 10.7mm before curving into the cutting edge. There are vertical scratch marks along the body of the axe on both faces.\n\nThe object measures 49.2mm in length, 14.8mm in max.width, 3.8mm in max.thickness and weighs 7.91g.\n\n\n\nThis object is clearly modelled on the low-flanged axe, characteristic of the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage. Arreton types date to metalworking stage VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 4 circa 1750-1550 BC. It is uncertain whether this is a miniature axe intended for use (it seems rather small for axe-purpose) or perhaps had use as a votive object; it is larger though in its miniature form similar to miniature socketed axes (for eg.HAMP-657353) thought to have an amulet or votive function and believed to date between the Bronze Age to the Roman period (Robinson, P; 1995).","fourFigureLat":"51.14037943","fourFigureLon":"-1.54397191","fromdate":"-1750","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jordan Gamble","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jordan Gamble","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nether Wallop","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPB3BE22.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"49.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
