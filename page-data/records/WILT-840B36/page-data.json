It measures 24.43x(max)26.86x(max)8.77mm and weighs 25.15g.\n\nThe damaged butt end appears to be complete at one corner and broken at the other. Just off centre is a bubble in the metalwork, possibly contributing to the break by weakening the metal.\n\nThe break at the other end of the fragment is I-shaped in section, just as the flanges are beginning to develop. The fragment is too small with not enough surviving of the flanges to tie it down further.\n\n1900 â€“ 1100 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.952185","fourFigureLon":"-1.759358","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"March 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.77","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hale","county":"Hampshire","district":"New Forest","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Bolger0509flangedaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"24.43"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
