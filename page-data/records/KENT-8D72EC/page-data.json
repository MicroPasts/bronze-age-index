The awl's shaft at the head end is octagonal in cross-section alternating wide and thin faces until it reaches its widest point (19mm from the head), after which it becomes cylindrical and thins gently until it reaches its point, the point has a pinch just behind the nib.\n\n\n\nTanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The attention to detail with the decorative facets around the head, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date. Bronze Age awls and narrow chisels are not common finds and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC, but maybe much later.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 88.11mm long, 6.81mm in diameter and 18.66g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"51.50034504","fourFigureLon":"0.08761954","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"6.81","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Erith","county":"Greater London Authority","district":"Bexley","regionName":"London","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT8D72EC.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"88.11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
