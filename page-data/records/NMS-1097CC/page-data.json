A casting seam runs the full length of the sides from the almost circular mouth over a double collar to the break&nbsp;(that on one side over the side loop as well). All four corners below the lower collar are chamfered so that the cross-section is octagonal. Each chamfer, running between two&nbsp;ribs, narrows and curves outwards as it descends. At the break there is a strong difference in the thickness of the metal, between 2mm on one side and 4.5mm on the other. In quite fresh condition with a few thin patches of grey chalky soil adhering. Weight 135g. Extant length 77mm. Width at loop 40.7mm. Thickness at mouth 33.8mm. c.1000 - c.700&nbsp;BC.\n\nField WE3","fourFigureLat":"52.47023726","fourFigureLon":"0.60439104","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-701","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"March 01, 2020","datefound2":"March 31, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Rogerson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"33.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weeting-with-Broomhill","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/PFd_37699_1097CC_INDSE21042020HG_BA_SocketedAxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"77"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
