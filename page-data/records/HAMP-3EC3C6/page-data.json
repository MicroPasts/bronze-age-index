The object has a gradually tapering triangular blade with a central midrib on both faces. The tang is thicker and rectangular in cross-section. Between the two is a curve out to a highly abraded side protrusion that may have been perforated to take rivets. The blade has been bent at an angle of around forty-five degrees around halfway along and upwards again at the tip. The sides and the terminals have suffered abrasion in addition. The metal has corroded to a dark red-brown colour with mid-green metal below this patina. This piece is somewhat longer than an example illustrated in Moore and Rowlands (1972, 66/Plate XVI; ref. 89).","fourFigureLat":"51.202955","fourFigureLon":"-1.457474","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.65","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Andover","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-3EC3C6knifeblade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"153.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
