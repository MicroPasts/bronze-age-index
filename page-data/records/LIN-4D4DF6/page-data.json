The axe is dark yellowish brown with an even surface patina except in a few places where green patina is visible. There are a number of shallow grooves on both faces of the blade indicative of use rather than recent damage in the ploughsoil. It measures 58 mm in length but the butt is missing. The break is just behind a median bevelled stop and is patinated consistent with the rest of the axe perhaps suggesting breakage in use. Width at the crescentic cutting edge is 50.5 mm and the axe weighs 89.3 gm with a maximum thickness of 9.2 mm. It has vertically faceted sides worked into slight flanges. No evidence for decoration. It is very similar to an axe from Hutton Cranswick, East Riding, Yorkshire (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p. 61 & Plate 37, 316). The axe fits within Needham's Period 3 (MA IV) 2050-1700 CAL BC (Needham, 1996).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nNeedham, S. (1996). Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age.
