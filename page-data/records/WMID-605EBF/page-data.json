Early or primary palstave of Group I - shield patterned type.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has a triangular shaped blade in plan. The palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 28.7 mm in width and 8.1 mm thick.\n\n\n\nBeneath the stop-ridge descends a shield shaped hollow, this is visible but worn on both faces.\n\n\n\nThe blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical and shows wear. The cutting edge measures 64.7 mm in width and is 9.6 mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of most of the original surface.\n\n\n\nThis form and style of palstave fits can be classified as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC specifically within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. A close comparison to this palstave has been recorded from the Albrighton Area, Shropshire (HESH-D05FE3) and (WMID-755304) discovered in the Staffordshire Moorlands. Schmidt and Burgess (1981) have parallels for this type on plate 57.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill adds that the Palstave is heavier than normal, it was in this period that the makers were experimenting with adding more lead in to the composition. This was because by adding more lead it helped fill all corners of the mould.\n\n\n\nOverall the palstave measures 152 mm in length, a maximum width of 64.7 mm at the cutting edge, and a maximum thickness near the stop ridge of 28.8 mm. It weighs 468.7 g.\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P. K. and Burgess, C. B., 1981. The axes of Scotland and Northern England Munchen : C.H.
