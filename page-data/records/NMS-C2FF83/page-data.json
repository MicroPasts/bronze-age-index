It comprises a strip of sheet gold with worn transverse breaks at either end. Now bent approximately mid-way along its length at an obtuse angle, probably after deposition; the bend shows stress marks and there is a small tear at the apex. Both surfaces have traces of hammer marks, indicating that it was hammered flat from a thicker wire or bar. \n\n\n\nDimensions: Length (bent): 49.5mm, approximate unbent length: 66.7 maximum width: 11.8mm, minimum width: 8.5mm, thickness: 0.8mm, weight: 3.8g. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: Gold artefacts of sheet gold bearing similar hammered manufacturing marks include NMGW-09A1A5 (2008W8), described as an armlet, PAS-446915 (2013 T674), described as a ribbon and CORN-8EC344 (2014 T39), described as a mount. All three are described as being of probable Bronze Age date. BH-1BE953 (2014 T901), also described as an unidentified object states: “There is a range of gold strip and ribbon ornaments datable to the British Bronze Age. The less numerous types include arm and possibly ear ornaments fastening by means of a hook at each end, or a hook and eye (piercing)… There are also an increasing number of (often) thin gold strips and fragments with terminal piercings which on grounds of composition could fit into a Bronze Age context. Again, there are continental analogues, beginning within the Early Bronze Age sheet gold tradition.”\n\n\n\nDate: c. 1500 – 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.72484481","fourFigureLon":"0.87132838","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"The object appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"August 19, 2018","datefound2":"August 19, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mileham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/64315_C2FF83_IND28102018JS_BA_UnidentifiedObject.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"49.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
