The fragment is partially hollow, with the socket surviving to a depth of 14.2 mm. Longitudinal ridges are present on either edge; these are all that remain of the plough rolled blades. The spearhead tapers to a sharp point.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead fragment is a dark brown with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of most of the original surface detail and the finder has coated extant remains with a preservative substance.\n\n\n\nFrom what remains of the fragmnet it is impossible to refine the dating of the piece, although given its small size it is most likely to date from the Middle Bronze Age period c. 1600-1200 BC.\n\n\n\nThe fragmnet measures 57.4 mm in length, a maximum width of 13.7, a minimum width of 1.2 mm, a maximum thickness of 11.7 mm and a minimum thickness of 2.0 mm. It weighs 15.8 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.57955073","fourFigureLon":"-1.75055595","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"May 22, 2014","datefound2":"May 22, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Middleton","county":"Warwickshire","district":"North Warwickshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-EB0842.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"57.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
