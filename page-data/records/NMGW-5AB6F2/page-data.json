The mouth is oval (33.0mm wide and 27.4mm deep external and 23.8mm x 17.8mm internal). The top of the mouth has a lip-ridge from casting and appears to have been a four-runner casting, now with two stubs evident. The collar is rounded and bevelled to the face. The loop springs from the base of the moulding and is of rounded, sub-lozenge section (with a length of 21mm, 9.0mm internal, 4.8mm wide and 4.3mm thick). The sides are moderately straight and near-parallel (with a width below the loop of 28.2mm) before diverging sharply to produce an expanded and curved blade edge (with a width of 37.6mm). Both sides have a clear ridge from the casting seam, which has been neatly finished. The casting seam on the unlooped side is notably flattened opposite the loop, perhaps from the binding. The blade edge has some post depositional damage. Both faces are decorated the three converging ribs, with the side ribs beginning at the corners of the faces. The faces are convex across their widths and also have a gentle convexity across their lengths, before converging sharply below a blade facet (19mm from the blade edge). The body of the axe has a rounded, sub-rectangular section. Sharpening striations are evident on both on faces, running along the blade. The surface is corroded with a patchy dark-brown patina over a mid-brown surface.\n\nThe ribbed socketed axehead with no moulding beneath the collar and probable four-runner casting is likely to indicate an axe allied to the South Wales (Stogursey) type. However, the axe is considerably smaller than would be expected and also has a rounded body section with a blade facet and recurved blade, which are all features atypical of the type.","fourFigureLat":"51.52006907","fourFigureLon":"-3.35619487","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pont-y-Clun","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20161491.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"62.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
