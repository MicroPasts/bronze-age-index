The socket is sub-square in cross-section at the mouth with a double moulding on the exterior. The main body of the hammer is narrow below the moulded collar and flares slightly to the working face. The face and body are as one unlike modern hammers so the bell/poll is from the socket to the working face. The face has a convex surface and is a rounded square in plan, with convex sides and smooth, rounded edges. The face is relatively smooth and its edges are marked by a range of numerous irregular and differently aligned indentations, some of which could be recent agricultural damage, but most of which are probably use wear.\n\n\n\nThe surface condition of the hammer is good, though there are several patches of surface loss where pale green corrosive products are visible. Otherwise the surface is patinated dark green.\n\n\n\nMeasurements:  55.16mm in length, 31.38mm wide, at the bell/poll; 29.75mm thick, and weight of 166.75g in weight.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Socketed hammers are a rare find, especially when compared to socketed axeheads with, at the date of writing less than 60 examples reported to the PAS Database and only a small number of examples found in Kent;  KENT-FDBC44 and another in Crundale Hoard KENT-7C3863. The Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website comments that the \"socketed (hammers are) only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976: 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA' With regard to decoration, they are found with or without a single rib band, and in the case of a few hoards in Brittany, some hammers were found with chevron decoration.\" Another example on the PAS database with decoration similar to this example is NMGW-475C27.\n\n\n\nThe YORYM-ABCCE1 record for another hammer discusses the dating of socketed hammers stating that 'early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding'. with this in mind this example appears to date to the Late Bronze Age. Other similar examples on the PAS database include: WAW-762B82; YORYM-86F1B4; and SF-B89096.","fourFigureLat":"51.2595163","fourFigureLon":"0.44935482","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.75","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barming","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68/KENT73D8B4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"55.16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
