The blade is broadly triangular and has a flat, pointed-oval cross-section. There is a ridge along the edge of the blade, where it was hammered to sharpen the edge. At the tang end the blade narrows sharply from 35.6 mm wide to 14.1 mm wide and then the tang projects from there and tapers gradually, measuring 11.4 mm wide at the break. The tang has a rectangular cross-section.\n\n\n\nOverall, the dagger measures 114.6 mm long, 35.6 mm wide and 6.7 mm thick. It weighs 105.65 g.\n\n\n\nThe surface has mid to dark green patina, but the surface is pitted and in some places quite corroded and covered in light green and brown corrosion product.","fourFigureLat":"53.07355488","fourFigureLon":"-1.59845526","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-2300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"Alastair Willis","datefound1":"March 01, 2016","datefound2":"March 30, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alastair Willis","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wirksworth","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Derbyshire Dales","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENOD366D7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"114.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
