This artefact could be further classified as dating from the Ewart Park phase, between 1000 – 800 BC.\n\nThe axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a hollow triangular section.  At one end of the artefact, the open socket is square with a moulded and lipped edge protruding outwards from all four sides.  The inside of the socket is completely empty.  To either side and immediately below the lipped top of the axe, there are three vertical ribs protruding upwards on each face, with four alternating recessed indentations.  Each rib is approximately 33.5mm in length and 3.5mm in width.  Additionally, each rib tapers inwards slightly as they continue down the artefact’s length whilst becoming less prominent and worn as they seem to blend in with the axe’s expanding blade.  To one side of the artefact, there is a single and integrally cast copper alloy loop (length of loop: 24mm; width of loop: 11mm; thickness of loop: 9mm; length of oval loop hole: 8.5mm; width of loop hole: 5.5mm).  The blade tip curves outwards along the outside edge to either side of the artefact with the blade’s cutting edge still intact.  Additionally, a prominent casting seam is visible down the length of the axe’s sides, running from the lipped open socket to the blade tip.  Although this artefact does appear to have been possibly coated in a substance, the axe is in a slightly worn but good condition with a very dark brown patina.  Some areas of the artefact (near the blade) have small patches where the original patina has corroded and there is a probable scrap/ scratch on the artefact’s side.\n\nA similar example is illustrated in Evans, J, 1881, ‘Ancient Bronze Implements of Great Britain’, pages 117-8, fig 124, line 9, which was found at Reach Fen, Cambridgeshire.","fourFigureLat":"52.732054","fourFigureLon":"-2.371661","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"George Potts","datefound1":"May 13, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"39.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chetwynd Aston and Woodcote","county":"Telford and Wrekin","district":"Telford and Wrekin","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-8865D5.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"87.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
