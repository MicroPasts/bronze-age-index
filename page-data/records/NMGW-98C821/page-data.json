Taunton / Cemmaes metalworking falls within Needham's (1996) Period 5, c. 1500 - 1150 BC. The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 163mm and weighs 494.8g. The butt is square and irregular with a width of 20.7mm and has a thickness of 4.0mm. The sides are slightly convex as far as the stop and are then straight and divergent before flaring to the expanded blade. The palstave is wider around the flanges (26.2mm), than on the blade near the stop (19.8mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished (by hammering and filing), with particular attention paid to the blade area and the unlooped side. The loop is wide at 11.5mm. The septum is rounded and concave with a straight stop, which meets the septum at a right angle. The flange facets meet the septum before the butt and are highest (37.3mm) at the stop. The stop has a height of 14.3mm above the septum and rises 9.4mm above the blade. The blade is decorated with a weak mid rib and side ribs. The ribs are defined by two small cast hollows (c. 20-28mm long and 3-4mm wide) flanking each rib. The blade has a maximum thickness below the stop of 23.7mm and gradually thins to 12.9mm at the prominent blade facet. Hammer dimples are evident on the blade facets of both faces. Some sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge are discernible. A single casting flaw on the septum of one face is visible. The palstave has good surface preservation and has a dark green to black patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.464384","fourFigureLon":"-3.498502","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"In form this palstave appears similar to Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Group III, it should be noted that the breadth of the stop/flanges, and the height above the septum, is very significant. Typically, low-flanged palstaves have a stop/flange breadth of no more than approx. 31mm and a stop/flange height around 10mm. A breadth of 37.1mm is closer to the criteria as defined for south-western palstaves, though that type are also characterised by angular flanges that rise above the height of the stop (Smith 1959). Examples with high flanges that do not rise above the height of the stop are known from Somerset, such as one found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012). However, parallels with flanges as broad as the Llandow palstave could not be identified.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llandow","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20063lowres.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"163"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
