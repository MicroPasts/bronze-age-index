Early or primary palstave of Group I - shield patterned type.\n\nThe palstave has a triangular shaped blade in plan. The palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 22.1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;in width and 5.1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;thick.\n\nBeneath the stop-ridge descends a shield shaped hollow, this is more visible on one side than the other. \n\nThe blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical and shows wear. The cutting edge measures 61.2&nbsp;mm&nbsp;in width and is 3.8&nbsp;mm&nbsp;thick.\n\nThe palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of much of the original surface.\n\nThis form and style of palstave fits can be classified as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250&nbsp;BC&nbsp;specifically within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. A close comparison to this palstave has been recorded from the Albrighton Area, Shropshire (HESH-D05FE3) and (WMID-755304) discovered in the Staffordshire Moorlands. Schmidt and Burgess (1981) have parallels for this type on plate 57.\n\nOverall, the palstave measures 162&nbsp;mm&nbsp;in length, a maximum width of 61&nbsp;mm&nbsp;at the cutting edge, and a maximum thickness near the stop ridge of 25.9&nbsp;mm. It weighs 449&nbsp;grams. \n\nSchmidt, P. K. and Burgess, C. B., 1981.&nbsp;The axes of Scotland and Northern England&nbsp;Munchen : C.H.
