In plan the spearhead is a sub-lozenge with abraded blade facets, thereby being misshapen. The tip is also abraded and missing. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is circular. The break at this point is not recent. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has traces of a dark brown patina, otherwise the surface is pitted and abraded. It measures 45.72mm long, 11mm wide, 8.14mm thick and weighs 8.2g.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.","fourFigureLat":"52.25609923","fourFigureLon":"-1.86957146","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"April 23, 2015","datefound2":"April 23, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Spernall","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW71CFCF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"45.72"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
