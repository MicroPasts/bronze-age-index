The base of the socket is present at the top of the fragment (where the axe has a surviving thickness of 13.4mm, the axe faces have a thickness of 5mm and the socket has a maximum width of 3.8mm and a surviving depth of 9.6mm). The axe side appears to flare outwards towards the mouth, although corrosion may have eroded the shape. The surviving side was likely to have been convex across its width or have had a hexagonal body profile. The faces of the fragment are straight and converge to the blade. The blade edge has been lost. The axe has a significant crack across one face and the side, which is likely to have occurred in antiquity. The broken side of the axe is patinated, suggesting that the axe was broken in antiquity. Areas of brown surface patina survive, elsewhere the fragment is pale green with a powdery surface.\n\n\n\nSocketed axes occur in the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age and continue to Llyn Fawr phase, however most recovered axes date to Ewart Park industry and the comparatively heavy weight suggests a high lead bronze alloy, which is a feature common in Ewart Park axes.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanfair","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.52.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"PAS","length":"41.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
