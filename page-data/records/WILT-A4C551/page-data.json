The edges of the blade are quite jagged, but otherwise the patina is smooth and shiny and brown.\nThe socket (diameter 20mm, internal 16mm) is decorated with a series of vertical nicks, which are visible with socket end facing. Above this are four crude incised lines - rather wiggly and in one place one line vears off as though the designer has made a mistake. Directly above these is a ring of vvvvvvvv. Then two more groups of five incised lines, the top-most of which runs through the peg holes, 11.5mm from the socket end.\nThe spearhead is 92.5mm long and the maximum blade width is 24mm. The edges are bevelled and the tip (now worn) has the classic bullet-shape for this type. Weighs 28.04g.\n8th/ 9th century BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.09627451","fourFigureLon":"-2.08705964","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"October 10, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fonthill Bishop","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/DicksonSpear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society","length":"92.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
