The Liss-type bracelet is solid and oval in section and in good condition with brown patina. The body is decorated with incised or engraved panels which are relatively deep and have been applied with some degree of care. The complex decoration comprises of panels of lines or rows of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern separated by 'dividing' sections of 10 or more lines of vertical bands (to the circumference of the bracelet-arming). The three central panels are comprised of 8 or 9 horizontal bands that widen to create an oval, the centre of which are decorated with 6 vertical bands.\n\n\n\nAs an oval, the external diameter is 95.5mm by 83.7mm with an internal diameter of 66.8mm by 52.1mm and a width of 12.9 mm.

They are known from the Taunton phase (1,400 -1,200 BC) of the Bronze Age onwards, mainly from Southern Britain. These bracelets concentrate in the southern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and West Sussex and examples are also known from Suffolk and Norfolk. Incised decorated bracelets form part of a North European tradition, which has led to the suggestion that the examples from southern England may be imported from northern France, although this theory has been questioned (O'Connor 1980). While some of the known bracelets come from hoards containing items such as torcs, pins, axes, palstaves and other mid-Bronze Age artefacts, no other objects were found in association with this example. See Recent Metalwork Discoveries in Hampshire for a comprehensive report, published by Sally Worrell in Hampshire Studies (2002, no.1). They are comparatively rarer than tools and weapons. Similar examples were found in the Ebbesbourne Wake hoard (Moore and Rowlands 1972:63-5, Plate XV) and a hoard from Norton Fitzwarren (Needham in Ellis 1989:31-31, 36).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"83.7","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Merton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BAbracelet.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
