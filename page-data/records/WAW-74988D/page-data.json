The copper alloy spearhead consists of the central portion of the socketed spearhead. In section the spearhead is has a sub-circular, tapering cylinder with a broken upper and lower edges. The upper edge break has the patina covering the break. The break of the lower edge is more recent. On the exterior there are the remains of incomplete side loops, one on each side edge.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the spearhead has an incomplete well-developed mid brown patina.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 60.64mm in length, 15.28mm in width, and weighs 18.17g.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.","fourFigureLat":"52.05805129","fourFigureLon":"-2.27852735","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2016","datefound2":"March 08, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upton-upon-Severn","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Malvern Hills","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW74988D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"60.64"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
