The stop is slightly curved with very worn flanges. There is a very worn shield below the stop on one side and the flanges are cast as one with the stop. The blade narrows in width from 19.08mm at the stop to 14.74mm at the lower break. The thickness narrows from 12.22mm at the stop to 9.16mm at the lower break. The surface is very worn and pitted with green and brown patches. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: length 35.10mm, width 19.08 mm, thickness 11.80mm, weight 37.33g.\n\n\n\nOther examples on the database include;  SF-09D1D5; NMS-56CD12 and KENT-D5F626 which notes:  similar examples are noted by Rowlands (1976: pp. 44-45, form iii, pl. 34 no. 1132), who notes that flanged chisels with shield shaped mouldings have a typological relationship with flanged axes and palstaves and are particularly concentrated in East Anglia.  Peter Reavill, FLO for Shropshire and Herefordshire comments further that \"this form of relative rare flanged (palstave-like) chisel are most probably aligned with the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II) c. 1500-1300 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.89460542","fourFigureLon":"-0.26664987","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"July 17, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Timothy Locke","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Henfield","county":"West Sussex","district":"Horsham","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS40FA73.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"35.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
