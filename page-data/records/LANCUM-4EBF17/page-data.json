The lower part of the object consists of an inverted-sub-conical plug. The upper end of this plug bifurcates into 3 circular-sectioned arms, each with a vertical, flat outer face.\n\n\n\nCasting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below. As they represent re-usable metal, they were often retained and regularly turn up in founder's hoards of the period. Given the jets size it is unlikely to be from brooch production and is more likely to relate to a large object such as an axe, dagger or sword. Similar to BH-8BDE6E, BH-4D6780 and ESS-39BA43\n\n\n\nThe length is 29mm, the width is 26mm, thickness 17mm and the weight 25.93g.","fourFigureLat":"52.97224312","fourFigureLon":"-0.30382444","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"October 05, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harmston","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM4EBF17.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
