The implement is represented by the top of the blade and the beginning of the handle, but has broken at both ends and has a surviving length of 30.5mm. No rivet holes are evident at the top and much of the peripheries have been lost. The fragment has a maximum width at the end of the blade of 17.5mm. It is possible that the implement has broken across the rivet holes. The handle end thins towards the break. The blade is defined by blade edges either side of a poorly defined and rounded midrib, which diverges at the butt. No sharpening striations are evident on the blade. The fragment has a maximum thickness at the midrib of 2.3mm and weighs 4.8g. The fragment has a dark green to brown patina and has lost small patches of the surface. The slight nature of the fragment may suggest a dirk, small rapier, knife or dagger.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Malmesbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.25.3c.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"30.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
