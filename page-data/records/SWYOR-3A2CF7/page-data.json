One barb is missing and the edges are damaged. It has a rib along the centre on both faces, giving it a slightly lozenge shaped section. The end of the barb is rounded, as is the end of the surviving tang, though it is not clear if it is complete. The barb is half as long as the tang. The notch between the barb and tang has straight sides and a rounded end, but overall is fairly square and narrow (3.67mm wide at the widest point). The surface has a smooth golden brown patina which is well developed. There is some pitting which is green.\n\n\nThere are only 4 other Bronze Age flat, barbed and tanged arrowheads on the PAS database: NMS-F982A3, WMID-CE6A76, NARC-F9B223 and SF6680.\n\n\nSF6680 notes that: \"Tanged (usually with barbs) copper-alloy arrowheads are known from the  late Bronze Age in Britain and western Europe (cf. Brendon O'Connor,  1980), though they are rare\" and provides four parallels from Suffolk:  \"tanged, from ERL 050; barbed and tanged, from LKH and MNL 333 (neither yet on SMR); and uncertain shape, from EXG Misc. (from LBA  hoard)\".  The record also cites examples from Norfolk: \"examples include one from  Hockwold, one from Methwold, and two of uncertain provenance.\"\n\n\nNARC-F9B223 records that: \"Dr. Colin Pendleton (SCCAS) notes that there is no reason to doubt that  these are contemporary with Early Bronze Age flint examples of similar  form.\"\n\n\nWMID-CE6A76 cites other examples \"illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of  British and European Prehistoric metalwork in Birmingham City Museums',  page 11, ref no 90, found in Britain but with no provenance, as well as  page 26, ref nos 328 (found at the Swiss Lakes; no provenance); 329  (found at Lake Neuchatel) and 330 (found at the Swiss Lakes: no  provenance)\"\n\n\nNMS-F982A3 cites Stuart Needham, who having examined a photograph, commented:\n\n\n\n\n'It is interesting to learn of yet another of these arrowheads from  British soil. Many years ago I would have doubted the veracity of the  findspot, or suspected a collector's loss, However, there are now  sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard,  Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite  the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have  to be Early Bronze Age. Bronze barbed-and-tanged arrowheads in one guise  or another continue right through and my suspicion would be that most  finds are Middle to Late Bronze Age. The Penard example proved to have  an unusual metal composition suggestive of it being a foreigner.'","fourFigureLat":"53.489024","fourFigureLon":"-0.645021","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Carole Bloom","datefound1":"January 01, 2012","datefound2":"January 31, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carole Bloom","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.06","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Scotter","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1790_arrowhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"46.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
