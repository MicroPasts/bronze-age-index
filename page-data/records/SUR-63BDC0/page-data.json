The axe is poor condition although a recently-made groove reveals a rich shiny copper beneath the corrosion. Only about 20% of the original surface survives and there is no remaining trace of decoration or of sharpening striations. Also missing is some of the edge profile and the blade. The geology at the findspot is probably acid sandy clay.","fourFigureLat":"51.052499","fourFigureLon":"-0.645997","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"Also handed in for recording were an awl of grey flint and a translucent grey/brown flake, both from the same findspot.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"January 01, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Northchapel","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"100"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
