It is most probably from the period 1050-950 BC which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the later Middle and earlier Late Bronze Age; this corresponds with Needham (1996) Period 5-6 fitting with Metalworking Assemblage X. The axe is relatively diminutive (small) when compared to most palstaves being broadly rectangular in plan and ovoid in profile. The blade of the palstave has straight sides that flare to form a crescent shaped cutting edge. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete; although only a small part has probably been lost. The two sides flare progressively from the butt to the raised and thickened stop. The flanges are fused to the stop and the septum of the axe is smooth and undecorated. The casting seams and associated flashes on either side (long edge) have been trimmed and hammered flat. An integrally cast side loop descends on one edge; it is positioned astride the stop. The loop is D-shaped in cross-section. Below the stop ridge of the axe on the upper blade are three ribs - a central one and two tapering ones; these descend from the thickened stop and taper to an undefined edge at the mid-part of the upper blade. The ribs are present on both faces - although are better defined on one. The palstave has a well-defined polished mid-green coloured surface patina which is relatively well preserved. A small amount of surface abrasion and corrosion is present - mostly limited to the external edges. The break across the butt is patinated with a slightly lighter green patina suggesting damage in antiquity but more recent than deposition. More recent plough damage is visible on each surface but especially on the cutting edge, the loop and one face of the blade.\n\n\n\nThe palstave axe fits well with those known from the later period - most specifically defined as 'later palstaves' due to its size it is difficult to align it with a sub type - although it does have the majority of the traits identified as Type Isleham or more probably Type Nettlesham (after Burgess & Schmidt). This type is relatively uncommon with only a few examples being recorded on the PAS database. Good parallels can be seen from Hockenhul, Cheshire (LVPL-B27017) and also a mixed hoard of Late palstaves and socketed axes from Amport, Hampshire (HAMP-4DE734 etc). The nature of this hoard suggests this form of decorated axe has a potentially long life (well into the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (1000-750 BC).\n\n\n\nThe palstave measures: 152.5mm length, is 44.3mm width across the blade, 20.5mm width across the butt, the axe is 36.4mm thick across the stop and the septum is 6.7mm thick at the butt. The side flanges raise to a height of 6.7mm above the septum and the stop is 11.7mm.
