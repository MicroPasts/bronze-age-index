Only the tip of the axehead survives. The blade edge is mostly intact and has a convex curve. The fragment has a broadly rectangular cross-section at the break and the socket is revealed inside the break. One edge is bent inwards due to post depositional damage, and the edges are uneven and jagged. The fragment is corroded and pitted, with a green-brown patina.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 24.25mm from the break to the cutting edge, 36.29mm wide (length of cutting edge), and 10.19mm thick at the break. It weighs 29.05g. The internal measurements of the socket are 28.02mm by 5.67mm.\n\n\n\nCf.
