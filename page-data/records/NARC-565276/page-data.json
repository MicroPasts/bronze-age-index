The breaks are uneven and show signs of wear, suggesting ancient breaks. This fragment is the curved section of the blade, which is blunt.\n\n\nThis fragment is quite un-daignostic, and so closer dating and classification is difficult.\n\n\nAxes begin as flat axes at the start of the Bronze Age period and then develop into palstaves and then to  socketed axes. Many axes would have been used as modern axes are used as  a tool for chopping wood and organic materials. Some however have been  described as ingots and as votive offerings. They can be found as single  finds or in vast hoards of bronze Bronze Age objects.\n\n\nThe axe is 35mm long, 25mm wide and 5.mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"52.410773","fourFigureLon":"-0.693005","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Cassidy","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Cassidy","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weekley","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Kettering","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jcassidy/NARC-565276.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
