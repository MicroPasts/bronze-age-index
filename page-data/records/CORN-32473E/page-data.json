The broken end appears to have been deliberately cut to create a pointed apex which may have been to improve hafting if the fragment was re-used as some sort of perforating tool. This break is not typical of the deliberate breaking up of swords into fragments for deposition, which is often clean and perpendicular to the edge (Matt Knight pers comm). None of the original surface remains, as the fragment is so corroded and pitted from being in the sea, and there is no evidence of any mid rib which is common to Bronze Age swords. It is also very narrow for a sword blade but may come from a narrow Wilburton phase type sword or a blade that is stepped and narrowed in plan like the Carp's Tongue Complex sword, though the latter is not found in Cornwall.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a sword with a narrow blade and point from Weymouth, Dorset, on page 666, pl.105, no.476, which is dated from the Wilburton phase of the late Middle Bronze Age, c.1150-1000 BC.\n\n\n\nBurgess (1968) illustrates a sword found in the River Thames on page 22, fig.13, no.1 which dates from the Carp's Tongue Complex of the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.11214148","fourFigureLon":"-5.66600351","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"April 01, 2018","datefound2":"April 01, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Just","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN0207.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
