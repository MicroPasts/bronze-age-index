The object is slightly bent and flat in sub-section at one end and sub-rectangular in cross section at the point.  The blunt end gradually thickens along the tang to a wider mid-section 3.4mm in diameter before tapering to a point.  Found with a second, slightly larger complete copper alloy awl (OXON-D74956).\n\n\n\nThe awl is 42.5mm in length, 3.4mm at the widest section and 2.0mm in diameter at the blunt end.  It weighs: 1.7g.\n\n\n\nAwls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Referred to as \"pointed punches\" by Coles (1963-64 117). Plain awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).
