Gold ribbon ornaments are known from the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1300-1100 BC, but the ribbed effect is achieved here by grooving (cf the piece from Ilam, Staffs. (Treasure Annual Report 2005/6, 20, no.14). Solder is used at this date in the manufacture of other gold ornament types such as (probably) the pendant from Burton, where circular-sectioned wire has been spiralled to form the biconical element (Treasure Annual Report 2004, 198, no.485). In the same hoard was an unusual bracelet; the wires were here twisted and fixed at each end by flat rectangular terminals but also at intervals by solder. Solder was also frequently used in the making of Middle Bronze Age composite rings. Later during the Bronze Age the face-plates of lock rings were sometimes made from individual wires soldered together, a technique which may have originated in Ireland.\n\n\n\nAs the object is prehistoric and contains precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Designation Order 2002.\n\n\n\nGillian Varndell\n\n\n\nCurator, Department of Prehistory and Europe.","fourFigureLat":"51.31417","fourFigureLon":"1.169849","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a folded gold strip from Chislet, Kent, indicated a gold content of approximately 87-90%, a silver content of approximately 9-11% with approximately 1% copper.
