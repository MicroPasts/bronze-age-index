BC 1500 - c. BC 1150.\n\n\n\nThe fragment would have made the tip of the spear. The object is broadly triangular in plan and lozenge (diamond shaped) in section. There is a raised rib running the length of the fragment on both the front and the reverse face. From the rib each side of the fragment slopes down towards the blade. The cutting edges of the blade are damaged and much of the edge is now missing, presumed lost in antiquity. The tip of the fragment is also damaged, probably as a result of post depositional damage whilst within the plough soil. \n\n\n\nThe object measures 20.0 mm in length and is 18.8 mm wide at the base of the fragment and the tip is 4.8 mm wide. The tip has a thickness of 4.5 mm, the blade edge is 2.8 mm thick, and the base measures 15.6 mm thick. It weighs 5.8 g. \n\n\n\nThe object is a dark green in colour and has an even patina. There is evidence of post depositional damage on the surface of the object in the form of pitting and indentations. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. \n\n\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (c. 1500 - 1150BC).
