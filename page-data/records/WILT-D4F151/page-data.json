The chape has an oval opening, concave sides, a rounded bottom, and a perforation in each face. There are also two irregular perforations in the bottom, most likely resulting from ancient damage. The surface is smooth, with no decoration.\n\n\n\nChape is 18.4mm in height and 26.3mm at its widest point. The mouth of the chape is 21.2mm wide x 9.2mm thick, the internal measurements are 18mm x 6.3mm.\n\n\n\nA couple of these chapes are listed in O'Connor (1980, 190-191; ref. 161). They are associated with the 'carp's tongue complex' of south-east England and date to the Ewart Park metalworking phase.","fourFigureLat":"50.96132141","fourFigureLon":"-1.84474451","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Becky Hall","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Becky Hall","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"18.3","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rockbourne","county":"Hampshire","district":"New Forest","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILTD4F151.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
