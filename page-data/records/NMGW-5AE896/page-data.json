The tang is of square section and tapers to a curved edge. The base of the tang is defined by a rounded collar moulding, 6.2mm thick and 8.0mm wide. The blade sides diverge in a near straight (slightly concave) to a gently curved cutting edge of 24.3mm width. Some of the original surface survives on the chisel with a mid-green patina. The chisel weighs 18.1g.","fourFigureLat":"51.995445","fourFigureLon":"-2.015975","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-600","notes":"Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).\n\n\n\nTanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt 'C' sword.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Alderton","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Tewkesbury","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/Dscn2816.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"98.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
