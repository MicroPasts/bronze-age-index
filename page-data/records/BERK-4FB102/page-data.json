The spearhead is incomplete, missing its tip; the socket survives and has some damage to its edge, as do the blades of the spearhead, but otherwise it is in good condition with a dark green patina. The socket neck has two sub-circular holes for securing the spearhead to the shaft, by cord or possibly rivets. The socket tapers throughout the length of the spearhead producing a rounded midrib that extends to the (broken) tip.","fourFigureLat":"51.471674","fourFigureLon":"-1.267128","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"Another (incomplete) spearhead of the same date was found at the opposite end of the field; BERK-4F1825.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"October 22, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"24.88","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hampstead Norreys","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2011441.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"115.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
