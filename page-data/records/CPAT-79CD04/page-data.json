In style, it fits with the characteristics of the Sompting type and the Llyn Fawr Phase.  The axe is wedge shaped in both plan and profile view, with an ovoid socket.  There is a marked single strengthening collar to the mouth of the socket with the attachment loop being just below that collar, on the side seam of the axe. \n\nThere are pronounced moulding seams running from the mouth to the blade tips on each side.  The blade tips are slightly flared.  There is also a slight ‘chamfer', noticeable to each corner from the socket mouth, tapering down toward the blade.\n\nThe overall condition of the axe is poor, with considerable loss of the original surface, that which is left has a dull brown patina.  One side of the axe has been damaged and split, presumably in antiquity, that damage reveals how thin the walls of this axe are.  The apparent fragility of this moulding might explain the lightness of this axe at just 175 gms.\n\nAnother interesting feature of this axe is the internal moulding, which extends into the flare of the axe head.  That in turn, might suggest the possibility of reducing the metal content to a minimum, in conjunction with the thin walls.  Could this type of manufacture, with its lack of overall mass, indicate a more 'votive' aspect, than a practical tool?","fourFigureLat":"52.873748","fourFigureLon":"-2.803734","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"January 19, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"37","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wem Rural","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2456-0054r.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"106"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
