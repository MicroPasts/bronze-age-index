The dagger possesses a lentoidal-section tang which is rectangular in form and expands and flattens to form a rounded terminal. Extending from both the upper and lower surfaces of the tang are small, semi-circular projections measuring 14mm in length and 1mm in width. These projections would have helped secure a handle to the dagger. The tang expands to form the blade which is lentoidal in section and gently tapers to a point, now broken. It measures 180mm in length, the blade has a maximum width of 25mm and a thickness of 3mm. The tang has a width of 14mm.\n\n\n\nThe object was originally in two pieces and has been restored. It is difficult to fit this small dagger into existing typologies for Bronze Age weaponry and thus its identification must remain tentative. Dot Boughton comments 'that it might belong to the Penard phase, dating to the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age 1300-1150 BC and be a Ballintober type. Most British Ballintober swords come from the Thames Valley and a small number was found in South West England and South Wales. Until a sword of this type was found near Stranraer (Galloway), the most northerly find came from the River Trent in Nottinghamshire.'","fourFigureLat":"51.86116288","fourFigureLon":"-0.59281369","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philippa Walton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philippa Walton","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Edlesborough","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pwalton/BH2DF409.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"180"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
