Only the blade edge survives intact, the remainder now missing due to old breaks. The blade edge narrows to a flat tip, still relatively sharp, and is curved in form with expanded sides that narrow in towards the main section of the axe. In cross section the axe head is rectangular in plan and is hollow, showing the beginnings (or end) of a socket. The fragment has a light blue-green patina but much of this original surface is missing from one side of the blade. This is a fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe, possibly from the Ewart Park phase of metalwork c. 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.56308501","fourFigureLon":"-1.56861104","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Uffington","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2018445.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"23.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
