The artefact can probably be classified as a Trump Group II: Thetford Class rapier (see Trump, B, A, V, 1962, ‘The Origin and development of British Middle Bronze Age Rapiers’ in ‘Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society’, pages 80 – 102.\n\nOnly part of the butt, shoulder and blade remain.  In plan, the artefact is an inverted and elongated sub-triangle with a convex side-section.  The sides curve inwards below the shoulder/ butt to form the incomplete tapering blade (width at broken end of blade: 19mm).  At the shoulder/ butt of the rapier, there are two probably deliberate notches instead of rivet holes in opposing corners to the left and right, with an approximate diameter of 11mm, and a slightly incomplete straight edge above and between the rivet holes, forming a trapezoidal appearance at the top of the artefact.  A worn but prominent midrib is evident on both sides of the rapier commences from the butt, with an additional rib to either side which follows the curve of the each shoulder.  All three ribs continue to the break half way down the blade.  The blade edge is slightly incomplete in all areas due to corrosion and old breaks.  Overall, the artefact is in a worn but fair condition with a slightly pitted surface and little of the original green/ brown patina remaining.\n\nSimilar examples are illustrated in Trump’s paper (see details above), particularly on page 85, figs 10 (found at the River Ouse, Thetford) & 11 (found at the River Shannon), which are both of the Group II Thetford Class.  On page 87, Trump states that the distinguishing feature of this class is that instead of rivet holes, the rapiers have punched (probably) penannular and deliberate notches at the corners of the butt, as well as the strongly moulded blade with an arris.  Although no moulds of this rapier have ever been found before 1962, they have a wide distribution with a prominent number found in the Fens (where they seem to have generated from in England) as well as others from around England, but a large number have been found in Ireland and Scotland.\n\nAnother example of the Thetford Class is illustrated in Moore, C, N & Rowlands, M, 1972, ‘Bronze Age Metalwork in Salisbury Museum’, page 60 & plate XIII, ref no 69, from Pen pits, probably in Penselwood, Somerset.","fourFigureLat":"52.723443","fourFigureLon":"-1.779349","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"April 25, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Alrewas and Fradley","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-A78747.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"120"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
