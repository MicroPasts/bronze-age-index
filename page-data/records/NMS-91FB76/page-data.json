The present 73mm diameter annular shape is formed from circular-section bronze rod which has been twisted into a spiral. The ends slightly overlap and both have been broken in antiquity. On one of the broken ends the twist and cross-section begins to taper-off suggesting that the break is close to a missing hooked-end terminal. The other end is an abrupt break across full twist and cross-section. The evidence strongly suggests that this object is part of a larger penannular twisted torc, that has broken and been reformed into a bracelet-sized loop. It is a matter of conjecture as to whether this happened as a result of deliberate re-puposing, ceremonial practice or simple coincidence. Approximately 50% of the objects surface is covered with a dark green patina, the remainder comprises a lighter green mottled corrosion product formed from the breakdown of the patina. Examples of more complete twisted spiral torcs can be seen in the near Lewes hoard discovered in March 2011 (SUSS-C5D042).","fourFigureLat":"52.47765259","fourFigureLon":"1.04666728","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"July 26, 2017","datefound2":"July 26, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"73","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Old Buckenham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/IMG_0945.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
