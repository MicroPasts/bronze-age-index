It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). \n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced triangular cross-sectioned mid-rib on both faces, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. The edges of the blade are irregular and highly fragmentary due to corrosion. Some trace of edge bevels are discernable along parts of the blade edge, but it is hard to distinguish these from areas of corrosion. At the base of the blade is a socket, which is rectangular in plan, circular in cross-section, and is hollow, with no trace of wood remaining inside. Corrosion has created several holes in the sides of the socket. The socket has cast side loops roughly half way along its length, which are fragmentary.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is green and brown in colour and in poor condition. All surfaces of the object are pitted and have copper disease, and the edges of the object are very fragile. The spearhead is 154.1mm in length, 35.9mm in width, 22.3mm thickness, and weighs 102.2g. \n\n\n\nThis object corresponds closely with Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'. For this group, the most numerous of all Early and Middle Bronze Age spearheads, Davis suggests a chronology corresponding with the Acton Park and Taunton phases, about 1550 - 1250 BC.
