Alternatively, the object could possibly be part of a large arrowhead. The remaining portion consists of a short section of the socket together with the two small, integral side loops. The interior of the socket is circular; the outside tapers towards the blade of the spear and is triangular in section. The fragment is broken at both ends and longitudinally, so only half of the original thickness survives. Both the spear blade and the remainder of the socket are missing, and the breaks are very abraded and rounded. The fragment has a dark green patina. It is 30.7mm long, 14.4mm wide and 7.5mm thick. It weighs 5.99gm.\n\n\n\nMore complete examples of this type of spearhead can be found on the database. See for example references SF-26B707, WAW-F1A002 and LANCUM-ABC582. The object is unusually small for a spear, but arrowheads are not usually recorded with side loops.","fourFigureLat":"53.63823153","fourFigureLon":"-1.26037508","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"August 22, 2014","datefound2":"October 05, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thorpe Audlin","county":"Wakefield","district":"Wakefield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2382_spearjpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"30.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
