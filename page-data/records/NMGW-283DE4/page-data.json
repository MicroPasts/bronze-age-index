The gouge is comparatively short, with an overall length of 55.6mm. The socket is oval with an external width (across the blade) of 21.3mm and an external height of 19.7mm (internal: 17.7 x 16.6mm). The mouth of the gouge is plain, and 2.4mm beneath the mouth is a square collar moulding, with a width of 2mm. The sides of the gouge are slightly concave and expand at the blade tips, giving a width at the blade of 18.6mm. The casting flashes are visible on both sides and have minimal finishing. On one side, the flashes have been hammered for most of the length but are high and sharp near the collar. On the other side the flashes may have not been finished and are deep and wide. The blade edge largely survives and is convex. Sharpening striations are evident on the blade and run both along the blade and perpendicular to it. The surface of the gouge survives well with a dark brown patina. The under-face has an unusual linear effect, possibly the result of a mineralised organic. The gouge weighs 40.1g. The finder responsibly did not clean out the socket of the gouge. Excavation of the socket revealed remnants of the wooden handle preserved. The wood has been retained at NMGW.","fourFigureLat":"53.321749","fourFigureLon":"-4.298508","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-750","notes":"Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilburton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. Potential radiocarbon dating of the wood recovered from the socket could be useful in resolving this problem. The gouge can be paralleled with a larger and unprovenanced example in the Macalpine collection (Antiquities from Europe and the Near East, No. 11.61).\n\n\n\nDavid Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class III, which is characterised by its small, squat form and limited mouth mouldings, though typically this Class has a wider cutting edge.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katrina Deering","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llaneugrad","county":"Isle of Anglesey","district":"Isle of Anglesey","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/DSCN3377.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"55.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
