It has slightly rounded corners. One side of the awl tapers to a long blunt point becoming slightly more rounded in section. The other side tapers on the upper and lower face becoming sub-rectangular. The terminal of this portion is a broken edge, which is not too recent, but the patina does not cover the break. In profile the awl is an asymmetrical lentoid. The awl has a well developed mid brown coloured patina. It measures 34.76mm long, 5.49mm wide and 5.16mm thick. It weighs 3.5g. \n\nThe awl probably dates to the Bronze Age. Needham (in Longley, D. & Needham, S 1980 ‘Runnymede Bridge 1976: Excavations on the site of a Late Bronze Age settlement’, Surrey Archaeological Society Volume 6, page 19.) discusses awls and comments that they cannot be dated with accuracy within the Bronze Age period as they are found in Early Bronze Age contexts, such as graves as well as Middle and Late Bronze Age hoards.","fourFigureLat":"52.157188","fourFigureLon":"-1.855243","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bidford-on-Avon","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-C63EB7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"34.76"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
