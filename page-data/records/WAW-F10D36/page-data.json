In plan the spearhead is an elongated sub-triangle with the blade facets and tip both being abraded. The spear blades cutting edges have been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is oval. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has a light grey/green coloured patina which is incomplete. It measures 50.08mm long, 13.47mm wide, 5.66mm thick and weighs 8.8g.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.","fourFigureLat":"52.33704904","fourFigureLon":"-2.08948263","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"October 24, 2012","datefound2":"December 02, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.66","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dodford with Grafton","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Bromsgrove","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-F10D36.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"50.08"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
