B and Gerloff, S,1981), with well defined triple arris to the blade, the central ridge flattens out as it reaches the handle, there is a faint wear impression of the omega shaped handle on the surface, the position of the rivet holes for the handle are not visible and the elongated, thin blade (possibly sub-type Lissane? although the blade is rather thin) is largely missing, The main surface of the rapier is patinated dark glossy brown (water patina?) and all the recently damaged areas are patinated mid-green. It is unusual to record a Group III from Norfolk, predominantly they are Group IV.
