The object is circular in cross-section (c.5.4mm diameter) with abutting terminals, a 0.9mm wide gap between. The cross section narrows at the terminals to c.4.4mm in diameter. The surface of the metal is very pitted and no original patina remains.\n\nThe ring measures 16.6mm in length, 14.9mm in height, 5.4mm in max.thickness and weighs 5.01g. The circular opening at the centre measures c.5.7mm in diameter.","fourFigureLat":"51.09530587","fourFigureLon":"-1.51585486","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"'The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008).
