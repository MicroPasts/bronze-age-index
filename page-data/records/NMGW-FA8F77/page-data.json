The two loops have been lost, but their remnants are visible near the base of the spearhead either side of the socket. The spearhead has eroded to such an extent that little else apart the socket survives forming a cylindrical tapering point. The bottom of the socket has broken and is missing.","fourFigureLat":"51.609099","fourFigureLon":"-3.431055","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1275","notes":"This is recorded in Davis' (2012, No.645) corpus as a Group 6 (Developed side-looped: Unclassified) spearhead.
