As we cannot see the collar the axehead can probably be classified as Meldreth type, Ewart Park phase of metalwork. The cutting edge is expanded and relatively undamaged. The sides are faceted, giving a six-sided cross section. The socket mouth is circular although the collar is missing. On the upper part of the axe is a D-shaped, oval sectioned (approx 8mm in depth) attachment loop, it is positioned unusually horizontally instead of vertically probably directly below the missing collar.\n\nDate: Late Bronze Age.\n\nDimensions: 95.3mm x 47.1mm x 21.8mm\n\nWeight: 123.12g\n\n\nDot Boughton (former FLO) has identified this as a Late Bronze Age facetted socketed axe of the Ewart Park Metalwork phase (1000 - 800 BC) and notes that the unusual form of the loop and thiness of the walls make it different from the generality of such axes.","fourFigureLat":"50.72723606","fourFigureLon":"-2.29889002","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Bevan","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Bevan","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Affpuddle and Turnerspuddle","county":"Dorset","district":"Purbeck","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucybev/DOR3F8141a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"95.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
