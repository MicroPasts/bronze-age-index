This fragment is the lower part of the blade. Viewed in plan, the sides flare outwards slightly to the cutting edge which is modestly curved. A break has occurred along the base of the socket where the wall of the axe, at this side, was much narrower than the opposite wall. Therefore, this break occurred along a weak point. This suggests that it wasn't made particularly well as the clay moulding placed at the centre of the cast wasn't central when the bronze was poured, resulting in a lopsided socket and one side being thicker. Viewed from the side, the blade is a steep 'V'-shape. The blade surface consists of a number of scratches on one side, where the other side is far too patinated to assess. The surfaces are generally covered in a thick mid-brown patina, with one side still showing the copper alloy surface. It measures 34.90mm x 39.83mm x 14.46mm, weighing 55.76g. Most socketed axes date between 1150-800BC according to Needham, 2004 (unpublished).
