The blade is only slightly crescent shaped with one rounded corner, the other being lost to a chip which continues to the blade edge. The The blade is triangular in profile narrowing in thickness from the break to the blade. At the break the axe is rectangular in cross section. There are no traces of a socket at the break although this is so close that it is not possible to rule out that it comes from a socketed axe.\n\n\n\nThe fragment has thick brown green patina.\n\n\n\nThe axehead fragment is 18.2mm long from break to blade, 37.6mm wide, 7.5mm thick at its break and weighs 19.3 grams.\n\n\n\nThe fragment represents blade end of a rectangular bodied axe. This may have been a palstave axe, in which case being a narrow bladed later type, or a socketed axe. Both possibilities would date this object to the Later Bronze Age and probably Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.76714266","fourFigureLon":"-1.08845788","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"August 09, 2020","datefound2":"August 09, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Worminghall","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/skyebeth/OXON809F01.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"18.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
