Only the blade and part of the collar survive. The artefact was composed of a wide, triangular/crescent-shaped blade and a rectangular-sectioned tang. Tang and blade were separated by a now very worn collar.\n\n\n\nThese artefacts tend to be identified as chisels, i.e. wood-working tools, such as in WREX-9F314E. However, they resemble (in size and shape) Earliest Iron Age so-called socketed chisels (SUR-2B05A8) which have now been reinterpreted as leather-working knives. Thus, the earlier tanged examples may be better identified as leather-working knives owing to their often thin, wide blades (IOW-383C47 and WAW-CEC22C).\n\n\n\nThe chisel measures 37.9mm in length, 41.1mm in width, 5.7mm at maximum thickness at the tang, and weighs 19.61g.\n\n\n\nSimilar knives are still in used today: http://www.knipknives.com/leather.php","fourFigureLat":"51.71186194","fourFigureLon":"-0.93035683","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"March 02, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chinnor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC8D28F72.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"37.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
