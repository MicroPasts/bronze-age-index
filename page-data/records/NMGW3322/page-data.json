The edges of both the butt and the blade are damaged and the surface of the axe has several spots of corrosion. The sides of the blade more or less evenly curve outwards towards the cutting edge from a point situated about one third along the length of the axe from the butt. The lower halves of both faces of the axe are decorated with a series of incised, longitudinally arranged, irregular, short strokes which form a distinctive 'rain pattern'. Longitudinal striations on both faces of the axe adjacent to the blade edge are probably use-related polish.\n\n\n\nLength 131.5mm, width of blade 78mm, width of butt 30.5mm, maximum thickness 11.5mm, weight 346.1 grams.\n\n\n\nAn example of the Midgale type of Early Bronze Age flat axe, falling within Needham's (1983) Class 3.","fourFigureLat":"51.547689","fourFigureLon":"-3.299328","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-1900","notes":"The Migdale type has been defined by Schmidt and Burgess as simple, thin-butt, bronze flat axes with more or less evenly curved sides and relatively wide cutting edges, which do not turn out abruptly from the sides (1981, 35). Migdale axes lack features such as median bevels, raised edges and the narrow straight-sided form frequently associated with decoration (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35). Attempts to subdivide the type on the basis of variation in form have been unsuccessful; graphs plotting indices of shape such as length, width and the ratios of the body width at various points along the length of the axe do not show discrete concentrations (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35). The Gwaelod-y-Garth example is a relatively narrow example of the type. Although most Migdale axes are plain the lower halves of both faces of this example are decorated with a series of incised irregular short dashes which form a 'rain pattern' cf. Harbison 1969, 67, fig.3.D3. Similar decoration is present on Migdale axes from Ystradowen, Glamorgan (Savory 1954-56; Savory 1980, 43,100, no.111, fig.17), Oxwich Bay, Gower (Gwilt and Macdonald 2000) and reportedly Montgomeryshire (Savory 1964-66, 192; Savory 1980, 43, 100, no.108, fig.17). As a type Migdale axes are difficult to date with precision. The typological metalworking stage or assemblage which includes Migdale axes has recently been dated from c.2300BC to c.1900BC (Needham 1996, 130, fig.2). Unfortunately, there is little independent evidence for the dating of decorated examples of the Migdale type, although there is some evidence to suggest that they may date to a late phase of the type's vogue (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 58).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip MacDonald","datefound1":"February 01, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantwit Fardre","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"131.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
