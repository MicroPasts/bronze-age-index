The axe has broken near the bottom of the socket, with a surviving socket depth of between 9.3 and 23.8mm. At the break the axe has a width of 39.7mm and a thickness of 17.4mm. The blade has a surviving width of 41.4mm, although blade tips may have been lost. The sides are straight and a little rounded across their width (possibly exaggerated by surface erosion). The position of the casting seams are discernible on the sides and would have been prominent on the original surface. The faces of the axe are slightly rounded and no evidence of ribs survives. The blade is also rounded. The axe has poor surface preservation and currently has a pale green colour.","fourFigureLat":"51.655716","fourFigureLon":"-3.287959","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"The straight sides and rectangular profile of the axe may suggest the axe is of South Wales (or Stoggursey) Type, belonging to the Ewart Park metalworking tradition and would suggest a date for the axe of 950 - 750BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"May 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gelligaer","county":"Caerphilly","district":"Caerphilly","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.128.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
