This fragment has a pointed sub-oval shaped cross-section that is slightly faceted, with a central longitudinal ridge flanked to either side by another longitudinal ridge, on both sides of the blade. The fragment has a maximum thickness of 6.2mm. The fragment is slightly curved suggestive of having been deliberately broken.\n\n\n\nThanks to P. Reavill & D.
