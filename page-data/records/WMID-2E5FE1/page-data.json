The septum end (length: 47mm; width: 21.5mm; thickness: 9.5mm) of the axehead is incomplete (the butt is completely missing) with a V-shaped break which is visible from the planned view of the artefact.  The septum also has flange facets that protrude upwards by approximately 5mm along the outside edge to the left and right and to either side of the artefact.  The protruding stop (width of the artefact at the stop: 21.5mm; thickness: see above), which when complete, would have been positioned halfway down the palstave, is more prominent on one side in comparison to the other (height of the stop on the prominent side: 14mm). Below the stop on the blade end of the artefact, there is a slight dished and small shield-shaped recess particularly visible on one side of the axehead.  The blade splays outwards towards the curved blade tip (see width above) with none of the original cutting edge remaining. The triangular sectioned blade tapers from a thickness of 19mm at the stop to 4.5mm immediately before the blade tip.  There is no evidence of a side loop on the artefact.  Overall, the palstave axehead is in a worn and corroded condition with none of the original patina remaining.  There are also small areas of bronze disease, which are particularly visible at the side flanges and stop on one side of the artefact only.\n\nA similar example is illusrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', page 7, ref no 37, which was found in Kings Heath, Birmingham.","fourFigureLat":"52.687387","fourFigureLon":"-2.267724","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"October 31, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Blymhill and Weston-under-Lizard","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-2E5FE1.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"123"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
