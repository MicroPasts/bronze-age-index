In plan it is an elongated sub-rectangle in plan. Both terminals gradually taper to a blunt point. The surface has an incomplete dark green patina with some pitting. In length the awl is 35.81mm, 5.38mm wide and 5.18mm thick. It weighs 4.12g.\n\n\n\nFrom the PAS website: http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl Awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as \"pointed punches\" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin. Dating and areas of discovery\n\n\n\nHowever, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002). They note that although most awls are associated with leather working, some would have been used in woodworking, bone working and other crafts.\n\n\n\nColes, J M (1964) 'Scottish Middle Bronze Age Metalwork', Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 97 (1963-4)\n\n\n\nOttaway, P. and Rogers, N., 2002.
