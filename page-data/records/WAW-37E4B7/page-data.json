One terminal is broken, but not too recently. The other terminal has moulded decoration consisting of a horizontal ‘T’ shape with a pair of notches along the edge on either side. In plan for the bracelet has been distorted and forms a coil with the terminals sticking out beyond the coil. At the opposite edge at the apex of the coil there is a slightly tear and crack on the exterior face due to the distortion. The bracelet has an incomplete well developed shiny brown patina. It measures 29.48mm long, 30.53mm wide from terminal to terminal and 7.85mm thick at the terminal. It weighs 9.6g.  \n\nThe bracelet probably dates to the late Bronze Age period (-1150 - -800). A similar example is illustrated in Evans (Evans, J. 1881 The Ancient Bronze Implements, Weapons and Ornaments of Great Britain and Ireland Longmans, Green and Co.
