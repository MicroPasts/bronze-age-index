Cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a very shallow lenticular side profile. The flanges are slightly triple-faceted, so are slightly angled inwards on both faces and on one side very faint traces of decoration can be observed when lit correctly along the central, flat facet; this decoration appears to be hammered, angled corded decoration.\n\n\n\nThe axe has a curved bevel or ridge about halfway down the septum (c.53.5mm from the butt), which is marginally lower than the flanges, but indicates the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion, though this is clearer on the better preserved face and a shallow groove can be observed, emphasising this ridge. The cutting edge is quite deep (26mm) and has an even crescentic cutting edge, though this has slightly abraded as a result of corrosion.\n\n\n\nOn the better preserved face, on the inside of the flange on the right hand side of the septum below the bevel (when looked at in plan), there are two or three small angular indentations that are likely associated with working of the axe (e.g. hammering), but could represent the remains of decoration. The expansion of the blade is likely a combination of the original cast shape and hammering/working of the blade post-casting.\n\n\n\nVery little of the original surface of the axe is preserved. On one face there is dark green patina, preserving subtler features, but this is overall pocked with pale green corrosion. The sides of the axe are similar pocked and the opposite face is almost entirely covered in green corrosive build-up, which is particularly extensive on the blade and cutting edge.\n\n\n\nLength 122mm; blade width (tip to tip) 60.5mm; butt width 20.5mm; max. flange breadth 15mm; max. flange height c.2mm; bevel thickness (at centre) c.12.5mm; body width (at bevel) 26mm; weight 250.3g.","fourFigureLat":"51.45575985","fourFigureLon":"-3.46943322","fromdate":"-1725","todate":"-1500","notes":"The height of the flanges (i.e. above 1.5mm) and overall form of the axe means it can be confidently classed as a low-flanged axe, datable to the Arreton assemblage (c.1725-1500 cal. BC)/Period 4 of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997). The axe can be classed as Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 72-75) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming). Class 5 axes can be further sub-divided by taking additional measurements according to Needham (1983; forthcoming), specifically relating to the 'mean relative width of the body (MRW)' i.e. the breadth of the body. This axe possesses a MRW of 0.75mm, which can be considered 'slender' and falls within Needham's (forthcoming) Class 5B Bisham.\n\n\n\nClass 5B axes are known from across southern Britain, with examples of similar sizes from Syon Reach, Gloucestershire (Needham 1983, GL 20) and Milverton, Somerset (ibid., So 3/3). The depth of the Cowbridge blade/cutting edge (i.e. 26mm) is quite large considering the overall length of this axe, but an axe with similar proportions of length, blade depth and width can be observed in the Poslingford hoard, Suffolk (Needham 1983, Sf 26/7). This axe also has faceted flanges, though differs from the Cowbridge axe in having recurved blade tips and a shallower bevel.\n\n\n\nThe bevel on the Cowbridge axe is quite unusual and can be considered a 'stop-bump' (following Needham forthcoming), which anticipates the technological development of full stop ridges as seen on later flanged axes (specifically palstaves); this feature might thus indicate this axe can be dated later within the Arreton assemblage.\n\n\n\nNeedham (1983, 198) lists 179 Class 5 axes from southern Britain, indicating the broad currency of this axe type. In Wales, approximately 25 examples are currently known from both hoards and isolated contexts, with recent discoveries rapidly changing the image of how these axes were circulated. Class 5 axes are present in hoards from Menai Bridge, Anglesey (Savory 1980, 115, No.259), Llanover, Monmouthshire (NMGW-3F3BBC) and Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0B9997). Single finds are also known from Margam, Neath Port Talbot (Savory 1976; 1980, 102, No.122), Bangor Is-y-coed, Wrexham (CPAT-9DFD01) and Llanbradach and Pwllypant, Caerphilly (NMGW-CD7412).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Knight","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Knight","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cowbridge with Llanblethian","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/cowbridgeaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"122"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
