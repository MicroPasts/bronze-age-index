The axe has a subrectangular socket mouth with a moulded rim and single attachment loop. There appears to be dark, organic material within the socket mouth. A casting seam is visible above the fracture on the axe blade. The axe has fractured obliquely; the two pieces were found by a metal detectorist approximately 1m apart. There are small areas of pitting across the surface containing a powdery green corrosion product.\n\n\nThe blade is an unusual shape, having lateral indentations similar to another socketed axehead from the Nettleham hoard (P.J.Davey, Bronze Age Metalwork from Lincolnshire, p.103). The blade is comparable in form to earlier palstave axeheads, and this object may therefore represent a transitional form between the Middle and Late Bronze Age. Colin Burgess described this as metalwork stage XI (Wilburton). The most recent and generally accepted revised chronology by Needham (1996) would place it in his Period 6, 1150-950 cal BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.261461","fourFigureLon":"0.157404","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"August 26, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Alford","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/AL478.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"80.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
