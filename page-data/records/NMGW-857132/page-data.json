The jet has a weight of 35.0g and an overall depth of 17.4mm. At the base of the jet is a projecting stub or single-runner (19mm x 12mm x 7mm), which would have fed into the mould. The jet has an irregular surface with a dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.400716","fourFigureLon":"-3.553924","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"\nCasting jets are non diagnostic and are difficult to date outside of their archaeological context. The irregular surface suggests a clay mould-gate and the single runner may suggest the casting of some tool or weapon, other than an axe.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006197.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"34.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
