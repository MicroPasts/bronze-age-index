In plan, from the rounded butt end the width remains the same until about the centre of the axe when it begins to gently expand to the blade end; the butt end is damaged and broken due to an old break. In section, the axe gradually thickens slightly towards the centre but there is no ridge/stop or flanges. The blade edge and tips are rounded and worn. The artefact has a mid-green patina; the pitting is lighter green.","fourFigureLat":"51.046848","fourFigureLon":"-0.974274","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Richard Henry","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"September 21, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Richard Henry","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Colemore and Priors Dean","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry/HAMP-1556C2axe.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"52.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
