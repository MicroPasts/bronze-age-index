The ring is oval in plan with a triangular cross-sectional profile. The face has a pronounced midrib and eight smaller concentric ribs running around either side of the face (17 ribs in total) suggesting construction from gold wire, in contrast to the gold sheeting of the inner surface and terminals which is flat and undecorated. The opening in the ring has been damaged, with the gold plate broken to reveal the corroded copper alloy core. One of the terminals has split and been pushed back inside the ring, with the sheeting ruptured; there is additional crushing damage to one side of the ring which has ruptured the sheeting on the inner surface.\n\n\n\nLength: 19.6mm; width: 17.1mm; thickness: 5.2 mm; weight: 3.66g","fourFigureLat":"50.82870559","fourFigureLon":"-0.73767642","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"These types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC). They belong to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings', 'ring-money' or 'lock-rings' but whose function remains uncertain. They may have been personal adornments worn on the ears or nose, rather than items of exchange. A closely similar example in size and construction in the British Museum's Greenwell Collection (WG 20) was found at Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland.\n\n\n\nFor comparable examples on the database which have been declared Treasure, see SOM-50218D, ESS-5ECCA2 (2016T592), BERK-4A433E (2016T106) and BH-8DC056 (2009T513).\n\n\n\nConclusion: The item comprises more than 10% precious metal and is dated at over 300 years old at the time of finding. Additionally it is of prehistoric date and contains a proportion of precious metal. On both counts it therefore qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"January 24, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"6.8","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Oving","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUREFB639.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"19.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
