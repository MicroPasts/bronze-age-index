The chisel is roughly wedge shaped, tapering to a hammered point from a wide circular rim at the socket end. The socket itself is roughly square shapedand appears to have iron oxide within in the socket. The entirety of the object is a rough dark brown with patches of light brown corrosion and the occasional hint of light coppery metal. Oxidisaiton would suggest iron but some parts of the object have the green tinge of copper corrosion under the brown oxidisaiton.\n\n\n\nWith an overall length of 140.72mm and weighing 280g. The tip it is 13.22mm wide and 3.14mm thick, the circular collar has a diameter of 29.74mm and is 5.92mm thick.The rectangular recess is 42.32mm deep, the rectangle is orientated with the corners to the flat planes of the outer shaft.","fourFigureLat":"51.12976362","fourFigureLon":"0.99995138","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"This object is similar to known bronze age socketed chisels such as those illustrated by Pearce (1983 563, Plate 2, No.12 and 585, Plate 24, No.191), as well as examples on the PAS database at LON-80850F and CORN-42EF37.\n\n\n\nThe iron oxidisation around the socket is likely the result of depositional circumstances.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mags Erwin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mags Erwin","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"29.74","edge":null,"thickness":"3.14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brabourne","county":"Kent","district":"Ashford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT62F309.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"140.72"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
