Although generally flat in profile, there is a distinct thickening in the middle of the body of the axe and evidence of a nick and perhaps even negligible evidence of a flange on one side. The butt tapers towards the end to a rounded point. The blade is quite corroded on one edge and bulges out slightly on the other edge making it non-semetrical.\n\n\nThe surface is rather pitted with corrosion but some of the original patina remains.\n\n\nThis axe measures 79.07mm in length, 29.65mm width at the blade end, 8.86mm at the butt end, 8.86mm thickness at the middle (thickest).","fourFigureLat":"53.22201252","fourFigureLon":"-3.09482137","fromdate":"2050","todate":"1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sarah Pevely","datefound1":"April 30, 2011","datefound2":"July 11, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sarah Pevely","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.86","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Connah's Quay","county":"Flintshire","district":"Flintshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/spevely/BAaxeDSCN0547.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"79.07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
