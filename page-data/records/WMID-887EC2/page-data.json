There is the corroded and worn remains of a central midrib running down the artefact's length to either side, as well as slightly incomplete bevelled or ridged blade edges to the left and right on both sides. The hollow open socket is still visible although the artefact is now completely full of earth. The spearhead terminates in a pointed and corroded tip. Overall, the spearhead is in a worn and corroded condition, although some areas of dark green patina remain.","fourFigureLat":"52.624718","fourFigureLon":"-1.898026","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"October 09, 2006","datefound2":"October 09, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shenstone","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-887EC2.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"38"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
