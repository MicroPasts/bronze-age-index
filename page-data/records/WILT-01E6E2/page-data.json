It measures 44.52x16.12x15.78mm and weighs 14.27g. The fragment is rather twisted in appearance, possibly as the result of intense heat.\n\nThe mouth (6.25mm thick) has a prominent moulding from which the top of the loop extends. The inside edge of the loop seems to extend into another moulding below. However as so little of the body survives at this point it is difficult to be certain.\n\nThe casting flash on both inside and outside edges of the loop has not been finished. The metal is also rather pitted and a rich brown in colour with orange ?iron resiude.","fourFigureLat":"51.500904","fourFigureLon":"-2.087831","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"November 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sutton Benger","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Hemms0210sockaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"44.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
