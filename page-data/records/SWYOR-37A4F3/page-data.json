This corresponds with the Acton Park II, and Taunton metalworking Assemblages, that correspond with Needham Period 4 or 5. \n\n\n\nThe axe has a narrow, convex butt. The septum and upper blade are of the same thickness and there is no stop-ridge present. The flanges are cast and are a wide pointed oval shape in profile, nearly lozenge shaped. The blade has suggestions of a central ridge or arris on both faces. The sides flare out moderately to form the cutting edge which is convex, but the blade is fairly narrow overall when compared with the larger corpus of similar axes. Part of the original smooth patina survives in the septum, but most of the surface is pitted, corroded and lumpy, obscuring any decoration or facets. \n\n\n\nThe axehead is 153mm long, 54.1mm wide across the blade tips, 23.2mm wide across the butt, 35.4mm thick across the flanges, and 16.4mm thick across the centre of the blade. It weighs 426g.\n\n\n\nCompare DUR-05101C (Schmidt and Burgess Type Lissett), NCL-74C5D5 and DUR-41AE2E (Schmidt and Burgess Type Ulrome).","fourFigureLat":"53.9820308","fourFigureLon":"-2.07773199","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"October 06, 2020","datefound2":"October 06, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"35.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stirton with Thorlby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR37A4F3BronzeAgeFlangedAxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"153"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
