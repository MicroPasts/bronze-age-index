The object tapers in&nbsp;thickness from its socket to a flat &#39;blade&#39; end that is sub-triangular in form and measures 43.35mm in width,&nbsp;with one side diagonal and one side straight, now broken,&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;that this end widened outwards either side to form a trapezodial or crescentic shape. The patina is a green - dark green in colour with some areas of lighter copper-alloy corrosion which fits with an earlier Bronze Age date.&nbsp;\n\nThe object is highly unusual and very rare. There are no comparable axes in the corpus of axes covering northern Britain by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and neither are there comparable socketed chisels in the corpus of woodworking tools in southern England by Lee (2014). However, Eogan (2000, 215-16 and Plate 111) highlights the few examples found in Ireland with one parallel with the provenance only of &quot;County Armagh&quot; being the closest (No. U15).. A similar object can be seen in&nbsp;SUSS-CA3F71 which is dated to the Late Bronze Age. Similar objects have also come up in hoards from&nbsp;this period. See&nbsp;LANCUM-A5AF1B object number 5 for a similar comparison from a Late Bronze Age hoard from Lancaster.&nbsp;\n\nReferences\n\nEogan, G., 2000.&nbsp;The Socketed Bronze Axes in Ireland.
