The chisel is comprised of the blade and a fraction of the tang with a surviving overall length of 65.5mm. The tang is 9.8mm long (terminating in an old break), sub-square in section (5.4mm wide x 4.9mm deep) and flares out to a sub-oval collar (2.9mm tall x 11.5mm wide x 10mm deep) that narrows before the flanged shoulder (with a minimum width of 7.5mm). The sides of the blade are curved slightly before straightening out at the end, reaching a maximum width of 27.4mm. &nbsp;The original blade edge has been lost and has been lost but is roughly straight and asymmetrical, possibly indicating extensive use-wear, and is diagonal in angle with a chunk missing from the corner. Traces of striations are visible on one side. The surface on the opposing side has been lost to old damage. The surviving surface is a medium-dark green patina with patches of lighter green corrosion and black staining, probably from the deposition environment. The chisel weighs 228.79g.\n\nTanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Earliest Iron Age. An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the many may be dated to the Ewart Park phase (c.950-700&nbsp;BC) and into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600&nbsp;BC).\n\nTanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt &#39;C&#39; sword.\n\nSimilar objects have been recorded on the PAS database e.g. NMGW-E96F08, SOM-C8B934, WAW-199132.","fourFigureLat":"51.99151092","fourFigureLon":"-2.96260172","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adelle Bricking","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Peterchurch","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/NMWPA20221091.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"65.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
