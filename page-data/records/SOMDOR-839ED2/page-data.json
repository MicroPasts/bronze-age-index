The total length of the pin is 149.76 mm. The shaft of the pin is incomplete and slightly bent(in common with several other examples). At the distal end the shaft has a circular cross-section (4.5 mm) which broadens to become oval (7.38 mm by 5.15 mm) at the proximal end. The head is incomplete and has a lozenge shaped cross-section (5.2 mm x 5.99 mm at the proximal end and tapering to 3.37 mm x 4.45 mm at the furthest surviving extent) a characteristic of Somerset examples. It is not possible to establish the dimensions of the ring-shaped head and it appears to have been oval. The proximal end of the shaft and the remaining parts of the head are decorated with lateral incised lines front and back and also around the exterior pointed face of the head. The lines are longer on the shaft and where the shaft and head and here are raange in two lines (one on each side) angled inwards to form a chevron pointing away from the head (the design is repeated front and back). On the head the lines are short and cut across the points of the lozenge shaped cross section. It is middle Bronze Age in date (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"December 19, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Dorset","district":"North Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/caht/839ED2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"149.76"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
