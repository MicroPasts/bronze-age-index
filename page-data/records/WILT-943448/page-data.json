It is missing any handle. It is cast in one piece but can be described in two sections. It has a square-sectioned tang which abuts the rectangular-sectioned, collared handle stop of the chisel blade. At the other end is the chisel blade beyond the tang. At the point of the tang, the blade narrows in thickness to the blade's outer edge. The sides of the blade extend from the handle stop, more or less parallel with one another before flaring out a little towards the outer edge which is now also rounded. \n\n\n\nDimensions: overall 106.7mm in length; 19.4mm in width (the stop bar); 72 g in weight. The blade is 61mm in length, 17.3mm in width; the shaft 45mm in length, 14.7mm in width.\n\n\n\nTanged chisels, which date from c. 1150-850 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds; complete examples from such contexts are uncommon. \n\n\n\nSee BERK-4008DB for similar on the PAS database.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Hanbidge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Hanbidge","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sophaw123/WILT943448.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"106.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
