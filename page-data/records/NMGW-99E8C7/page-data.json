The bead is damaged and misshapen, with a snag and a tear evident (maximum diameter 13.5mm, maximum height/width 8.0mm, thickness of sheet <0.1mm, weight 0.84g). The gold wire is sub-rectangular in cross-section, with curving meanders, suggesting it was once coiled. One terminal has a globular shaped head; the other has a flattened and folded back hook terminal (maximum current length 40.7mm, diameter of wire 0.7-1.0mm, weight 1.13g).","fourFigureLat":"53.115202","fourFigureLon":"-2.972578","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"These two artefacts were found at the same location as the Burton hoard (TAR 2004, no.485). These artefacts therefore represent additions to the original hoard. The biconical bead is of identical form and similar dimensions to three other examples within the hoard. In Britain and France, good parallels may be found in Middle Bronze Age contexts (1400-1100BC). The gold wire was found attached to the biconical bead, the flattened hook terminal being held inside the interior of the bead. This object is hard to parallel, however its terminals resemble hook and clasp terminals on cuff armlets and ribbon torcs of gold, which date to between 1600-1300BC. The wire may once have been a finger ring joined with 'bulb and clasp' terminals. Semi-quantitative metallurgical analysis of both the bead and the wire indicated a very high gold composition, with a small percentage of silver and 1-1.5% copper.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"July 31, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Adam Gwilt","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"13.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rossett","county":"Wrexham","district":"Wrexham","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH003184_02.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums and Galleries of Wales","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
