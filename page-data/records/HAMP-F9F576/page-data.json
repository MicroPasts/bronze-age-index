The pin has a slightly domed circular head (Dia.: c. 11.15mm).  Below the head the shaft tapers to a diameter of 4.35mm before swelling to a maximum diameter of 5.95mm. From the swelling the pin tapers gradually to a point.  The pin has been bent through ninety degrees; it is so thick there is a diagonal bend at the point of the right angle. Furthermore, the tip has been bent upwards and to the side slightly.  The artefact has developed a variable mid blue-green patina with some areas of corrosion. It would be c. 170mm long if straight.","fourFigureLat":"51.04967","fourFigureLon":"-1.373669","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sally Worrell","datefound1":"February 01, 1994","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hursley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-F9F576pin.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"106.05"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
