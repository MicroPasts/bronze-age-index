This assemblage is comprised of 13 separate artefacts, all made of copper-alloy and very likely from the same deposit as the initial hoard and adds to the subsequent addenda found on the site since the initial discovery (ESS-D0E1B5 / 2017 T301).\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nDescription\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nDimensions\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n1\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nIncomplete copper-alloy socketed axe with flared blade edges.

It is likely that this item (along with no 9) forms part of a fitting, possibly a pommel fitting. There is one straight unbroken edge, and a curving edge which shows evidence of breakage on one side. The underside is worn and slightly concave, curving inward closer to the edges. The upper surface is smooth with a dark green patina. It was considered that this could be part of the shaft of a socketed knife, but the straight edge and the relative thinness of the artefact would suggest a plate fitting function, rather than being a fragment of a cylindrical item.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWeight: 3.4mm, length: 31.5mm, width: 14.0mm, thickness: 1.3mm, diameter of rivet holes: 2.8mm\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n9\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nSub-rectangular copper-alloy sheet (similar to no 8). Like the above this item features an unbroken straight edge, the ends of which are connected to a curving edge. The edge of this item is slightly more damaged than that of no 8. There are three rivet holes, also spaced approx. 5.6 - 5.8mm apart from one another. It seems likely that this artefact was used in conjunction with number 8, probably as part of a pommel fitting. The underside is slightly concave and the surface is worn. The upper surface is smooth and has a dark green patina.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWeight: 3.1g, length: 33.8mm, width: 15.3mm, thickness: 1.0mm, diameter of rivet holes: 2.8mm\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n10\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nCopper-alloy blade tip, probably of a late Bronze Age rapier. The item is pointed oval in section, and tapers to a thin point. The opposite end terminated in a straight fracture. There is no evidence of a mid or side ribs on the blade tip.

The tool is rounded at the butt portion though a rectangular shaped section is still visible, particularly when viewing the inside of the artefact. At the butt end the corners are much more rounded. Tapering toward the chisel point, the corners of the rectangular shaped tool become much more defined. The wider sides taper to a sharp triangular point, which meet the terminal of the shorter sides perpendicularly, forming a straight edge, creating a wedge like, sharp terminal. The socket rim is slightly flared and thicker on the edge. The external patina is dark green and generally smooth.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWeight: 32.6mm, length: 74.6mm, width (at rim): 16.1mm, thickness (at rim): 16.0mm, width (mid-section): 9.0mm, thickness (mid-section): 11.3mm\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n13\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nCopper-alloy casting waste.
