The break occurred in antiquity and does not appear to have been the result of an evident weakness (at the break the axe has dimensions of 33mm x 23mm and with a maximum surviving socket depth of 43.6mm). One of the faces has impacted damage, forcing the face into the socket and possibly suggests deliberate damage. The other face has a crack extending from the break down the face (for 14mm).  The more complete side has the stub from the lower attachment of the loop. Beneath the loop the side is moderately straight, before flaring slightly to the gently expanded blade edge (giving a blade width of 39.00mm), slightly truncated. The blade edge has a shallow curve (with a depth of 9mm). The sides of the axe are bevelled towards the centre, where the casting seam is evident but has been neatly finished. The faces appear to have been moderately flat across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the blade edge. The faces were probably decorated with three convergent ribs and additionally sides of the faces appear to have been enhanced with ribbed mouldings. Deep striations are evident on the better preserved face, running diagonally from the blade edge and extending to the break. The striations appear to be beneath the patina and are too extensive to be sharpening striations. The surface is corroded and pitted with a dark-green patina and patches of bright-green corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.88398433","fourFigureLon":"-2.91671538","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"43.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanarth","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20171562new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"58.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
