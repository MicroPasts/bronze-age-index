The main body of the spear survives but the tip and part of the blade are missing. The hollow circular socket is triangular in plan and tapers to a raised central ridges from which the blades extend to both sides. Though incomplete the blade appears to have been leaf-shaped in plan with a pointed oval section. There are two worn holes on both blades to either side of the central spines where it meets the shaft. These basal loops are indicative of spearheads of the Taunton and Penard phases, 1400 – 1125 BC (Davis, 2017), and this type corresponds with Davis Group 8.\n\n\n\nThere is a break between the blade and the socket shaft which has been glued back together post-excavation by the finder.\n\n\n\nThe object has a mid grey-green patina. It is 124.62mm long and 35.34mm wide. The socket shaft is 63.77mm long and the blade is 59.94mm long. The central ridge is 12.05mm wide and the blade is only 1.80mm thick. It weighs 94g.\n\n\n\nThis fragment is likely to be the lower portion of YORYM-17F9E2 which is from the same location.","fourFigureLat":"54.08920436","fourFigureLon":"-0.47264845","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Rania Zein-Elabdin","datefound1":"October 11, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Rania Zein-Elabdin","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Langtoft","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/WS0369.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"124.62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
