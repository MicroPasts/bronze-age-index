There is also a section missing at the upper end&nbsp;where only a part of a single rivet hole remains, in line with the longitudinal centre line of the blade. The blade has a wide central rib and bevelled edges and cutting edge which is&nbsp;roughened but still sharp in places. The pierced upper section narrows a little above&nbsp;the blade itself and is flattened. There are transverse hammer marks, likely formed when the handle was originally fitted to the blade. It has a mid brown patina with small patches of green.\n\nDimensions: 110.3mm in length; 27.8mm in width; 2.6mm thick; 34.64g in weight\n\nc.f.
