The curviture in the item suggests that it may be a fragment from where the axe widens, before actually becoming socketed. There is a ridge at one end of the fragment, perhaps reflecting where the axehead expanded to become a socket for the handle.","fourFigureLat":"52.225495","fourFigureLon":"-1.064463","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"September 30, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Flore","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-6009C3 socketedaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
