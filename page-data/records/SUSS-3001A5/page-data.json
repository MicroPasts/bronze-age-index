The blade has flattened flanges running on each edge with irregular facets and flares to a curved cutting edge. A central rib runs down the middle of each side of the blade from the stop. The axe is heavily corroded and missing the butt and half of the cutting edge. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length: 140.74mm; width at stop: 26.75mm: width at broken edge of blade: 53.22mm; thickness at stop 27.92mm: at cutting edge: 3.29mm. Weight: 452g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Early midribbed palstaves belong to the Acton Park Phase II of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needhams (1996) Period 5 dating to 1500 to 1300BC.
