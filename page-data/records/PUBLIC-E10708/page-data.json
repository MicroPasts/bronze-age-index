The butt end narrows to 26.9 mm in width and is slightly convex. There are flanges on both sides of the shaft. The profile of the axe is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval with a maximum thickness at the centre of 13.2 mm. Weight 130.45 gsm\n\n\n\nThe surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\nThis object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg.HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).\n\n\n\nMiniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.\n\n\n\nSee also LANCUM-B28EB0.","fourFigureLat":"53.18366297","fourFigureLon":"-0.66962992","fromdate":"-2050","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Paul Whiteside","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Paul Whiteside","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eagle and Swinethorpe","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lisabrundle/PublicE10708.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"67.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
