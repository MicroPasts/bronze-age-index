A very small, possibly miniature axehead. It has a tapering, rounded butt. It is slightly thickened at the mid-point (possibly a proto stop-ridge). It flares, initially gently and then is stepped out into a wide, curved cutting edge which is thinned from the thickened mid-point. Then cutting edge is blunt and rounded. The axe has a flat sub-rectangular cross section with rounded short edges. There are no evident raised flanges. There is wear and damage on all faces. \n\nDate: Early Bronze Age - c. 2000 - 1700 BC\n\nDimensions: 61.28 mm x 24.92 mm x 8.35 mm\n\nWeight: 48.54 g\n\n\n\nSimilar to HESH-A147C8 and WMID-0BA3F4","fourFigureLat":"50.83271236","fourFigureLon":"-2.81076058","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-2000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.35","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Broadwindsor","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucybev/DORA5B077.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"61.28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
