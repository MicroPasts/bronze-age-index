The form corresponds to Davis’ (2012) Group 6 (Developed side-looped) and is most proba a product of the later Acton Park, Taunton or early Wilburton metalworking phases (Needham’s (1996) Periods 4-bly5, c 1500-1100 BC). The blade was leaf shaped and 18.7mm in width with a pronounced mid rib which extends to the socket. There is a small area of damage to one side of the blade. The socket depth is 52mm. There are two small and narrow flanking side loops around half way along the tapering conical socket.","fourFigureLat":"51.38148889","fourFigureLon":"-1.22546098","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Smither","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Smither","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thatcham","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK3435371.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"81.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
