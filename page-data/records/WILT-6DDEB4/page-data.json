The inside edge curves outwards to meet the outside edge, which is ridged. These ridges stand 2.5-3mm high, and 1mm prominent from the ring. They appear to be closely spaced and thin, becoming wider and more spaced out around the ring.\nThere is a clean break across the ring, and leaving a 1mm wide gap. However, this seems to have been 'filled in' on the outer edge, whether by corrosion or human intervention.\nThe internal diameter is 18m, external 25mm.\nPossibly Iron Age or even Bronze Age in date, and possibly a finger-ring.
