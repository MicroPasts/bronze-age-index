All that survives of this chisel is the blade, which is broken where it narrows at the top, just below where it would have formed into the tang. The blade is worn and has a light green, slightly powdery patina to it, which indicated its probably Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.17420311","fourFigureLon":"-1.15741432","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nutley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2014905.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"34.35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
