The axe belongs to the Taunton tradition of metalworking. There is a lozenge/oval  shaped flange on each side of the butt, designed to hold the haft in place. The flanges are slightly waisted, flaring at the blade and septum ends. The blade tip is crescent  shaped. There is no obvious stop ridge for the haft to  butt against, but the blade is thicker than the septum. The axe has a rough, pocked green and brown patina  with evidence of bronze disease in places. It measures 130.56 mm long, 63.4 wide at the blade and 25.7 mm wide at the septum. It measures 13.42 mm thick in the centre. It weighs 409.1 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.669308","fourFigureLon":"-1.690895","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"August 07, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.42","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harlaston","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-11DAE0.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"130.56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
