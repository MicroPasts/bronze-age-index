Most of the original blade edge has corroded away, but the blade still has a distinctive curved blade that has tapered to a thin edge.  The axehead tapers outwards from the blade to form the triangular section.  At approximately 79.5mm from the blade edge and 11.5mm from the scoketed mouth, there is a rounded/ arched cast copper alloy side loop (length: 21.5mm; width: 5.5mm; inner length of the loop: 10.5mm) integral to the main body of the axehead.  Additionally, the axehead is decorated by two parallel recessed ridges (approximate length: 3mm) immediately below the socketed mouth.  The first ridge commences 5mm below the mouth of the socket and there is a gap of 5mm again between the first and second ridge.  The second ridge is interrupted by the top terminal of the side loop.  The square socketed mouth is complete although worn along the edges.  Importantly, there is a substantial amount of wood surviving inside the socket (length of remaining wood: 48.5mm; diameter: 15mm; weight: 1.81g), which is now in a completely dry state and is strained green, presumably from being inside the copper alloy axehead for a long period of time.  Overall, the axehead, although worn, corroded, pitted and with very little of the original light brown patina remaining, is in a fair condition, particularly due to a large amount of wood surviving inside the socket.\n\nA number of similar examples (with identical decoration around the socket) are illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', pages 16-17, ref nos 166-173, most of which were found in France.","fourFigureLat":"53.119129","fourFigureLon":"-2.106044","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"June 30, 2006","datefound2":"July 30, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Horton","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Staffordshire Moorlands","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-6640F5.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"114"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
