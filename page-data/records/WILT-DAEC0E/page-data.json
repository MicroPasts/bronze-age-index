The spear is 210 mm in length and 39.90 mm at its widest point. The spear consists of a leaf-shaped blade, which tapers towards the tip. The blade is lozenge-form in cross section; the blade edges are rough in places, showing some wear and tear. The blade has a circular cross-sectioned mid-rib which gradually widens towards the base of the blade to form the socket. The mid-rib has a pronounced moulded groove bordering each side of the blade. At the top of each of these grooves, there is an elongated loop either side of the shaft, c 9.24 mm in length and 3 mm wide.\n\n\n\nThe top of the shaft displays some wear resulting in jagged edges for about half the circumference. A peghole pierces the shaft on each side, 18.42 mm down from the top of the shaft, in line with the leaves on the blade. These holes are c 4.82 mm in diameter. The socket is 20.79 mm in internal diameter.\n\n\n\nOne surface of the shaft is pierced in several places along much of the length of the blade, just above the groove: there are two small holes; another larger at 8.40 mm long; and a substantial rent 40.55 mm long and 6.26 mm high. In general, the surface of the shaft is smooth and uniform, with patches of green patina in places, above and below, mainly confined to the grooves.","fourFigureLat":"51.70709279","fourFigureLon":"-1.6106593","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Baker","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Baker","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grafton and Radcot","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILTDAEC0E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"210"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
