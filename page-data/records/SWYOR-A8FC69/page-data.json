It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces, triangular in cross-section, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. There is some damage to the edges of the blade and no edge bevels are discernable. The socket is oval in cross-section and is hollow, but is filled with possible mineralised wood. It has cast side loops roughly half way along the socket. The loops are a flat oval in cross-section, and one is blocked with a casting flange that has not been trimmed. The casting seams along the sides of the socket have been trimmed but are still proud. The spear has a smooth dark brown patina.\n\n\n\nCompare WMID-56E2E4 and see also Davis, R (2017) A Short Guide to early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads.
