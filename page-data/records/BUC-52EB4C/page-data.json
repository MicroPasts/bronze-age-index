Only part of the blade located near to the terminal (tip-end) survives. The fragment is sub rectangular in shape, narrowing towards the tip of the spear, which is worn and broken. The fragment is lozenge shaped in cross section. Running down the centre of the fragment on both sides is a raised midrib. The blade edges have been worn and there are notches along both the edges. The blade has a dark green patina, and has patches of brown corrosion. The blade is 23.6mm in length, 14.1mm in width, and 4.9mm in maximum thickness. It weighs 2.69g.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is similar to spear blades shown in Needham 1990, page 55, dating to the Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.62272127","fourFigureLon":"-1.0191268","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-801","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"September 06, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Britwell Salome","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC52EB4C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"23.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
