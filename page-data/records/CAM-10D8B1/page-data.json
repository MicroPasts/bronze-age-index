The blade is flared and the extreme edge and corners are missing due to damage and corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe palstave weighs 459.73g in its present condition. It has a length of 155.0mm, width of 25.1mm that increases to the maximum (but incomplete due to damage) width across the flaring blade of 64.0mm and maximum thickness of 25.8mm. See blue lines on the annotated image.\n\n\n\nThe artefact has a single shield shaped decoration positioned below the fused stop, and a subtle lateral single mid-rib below the shield. The cast side flanges are fused to the stop ridge and do not continue beyond the stop ridge. The blade is a crescentic or splayed fan shape. Some of these features are obscured from view by the presence of a concretion product that is present within the depressed areas to either side of and also covering the stop. See yellow dashed lines on the annotated image. Use wear is present on the blade.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This form of axe fits into the primary, or early phase, palstaves being specifically of group III c.1500-1300 BC, which corresponds with Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - and with Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.\n\n\n\nSimilar to Watson, P.J.
