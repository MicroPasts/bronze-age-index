The spearhead has a surviving length of 82.70mm. The socket tapers towards the blade and has a maximum surviving diameter of 9.47mm. The remnants of the upper attachment only of the side loops are evident on each side of the socket. The socket has an oval hole (24.82mm x 5.6mm) on one side; the hole is likely to be a casting problem, probably as result of a misaligned core, rather than subsequent damage. The blade is eroded (with a maximum width of 11.03mm) and is leaf- or flame-shaped. The end of the socket develops into a high mid-rib, which converges towards the tip and gives the blade a lozenge shaped section. The spearhead has lost much of the original surface and now has a dark brown patina, with some areas of bronze around the hole in the socket. The spearhead weighs 16.7g.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1120","notes":"The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and beyond, including Cadoxton-Juxta-Neath (Neath Port Talbot) Llanerfyl (Powys) and Nantwnlle (Ceredigion) (Savory, 1980, Nos. 227, 229 and 337 respectively). The Cadoxton-Juxta-Neath and Llanerfyl examples are of Acton Park metal, while the Nantwnlle example is of Cemmaes metal (ibid.).\n\n\n\nThis spearhead has been published by Richard Davis (2012, 105, No.638, Pl.36) within his Group 6 Unclassified (developed side-looped).\n\n\n\nDavis notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades, which might strengthen the idea that this spearhead originally had a flame-shaped blade, rather than a leaf-shaped blade.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"9.47","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantrisant","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.208.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"82.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
