The blade has no clearly defined midrib but has near straight faces gradually diverging towards the rounded central ridge (giving a consistent thickness of 5.7mm) of lenticular section. Both blade edges have been lost and only a very small piece of edge faceting is now evident (with a maximum surviving blade width of 26.7mm). The short blade fragment is flat across its length with no evidence of bending prior to breaking. There appear to be numerous striations running along the blade probably resulting from sharpening. The surface has a dark green patina preserved over much of the fragment with a silver sheen, probably from surface enrichment of tin and with areas of bright green corrosion at the periphery.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively slender form of the blade may suggest its derived from near the tip. Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age , Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140","fourFigureLat":"51.77643694","fourFigureLon":"-2.87105051","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanarth","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.97jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"42.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
