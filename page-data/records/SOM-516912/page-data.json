After this point it continues to narrow but with straighter sides to a width of 13.9mm at the break. it terminates in a clean diagonal break across the blade which is patinated and covered in brown concreted material. The blade is a pointed oval shape in cross section with a wide (c.9.4mm at the break) oval cross section midrib to either side of which it narrows more sharply to an that now has many chips along it.\n\n\n\nThe hilt is sub-rectangular in cross section. It narrows with straight angled sides from its maximum with of 32.3mm, where the blade projects, to an irregular break measuresc 17.7mm wide. The form of the hilt below this break is not clear.\n\n\n\nThe object has a dark green patina which is chipped away revealing a lighter green patina. The dark green patina sections are very smooth and quite reflective.\n\n\n\nThe fragment of the object is 51.7mm long, 32.3mm wide, and is 4.3mm thick. It weighs 21.24 grams.\n\n\n\nWithout the entirety of the blade the type of weapon must be general. The object is similar in form to Gerloff's (1981) Group IV rapiers many examples of which exist on the database e.g. SOM-EECC89, HAMP-99875D and SOM-71AABB.","fourFigureLat":"51.36547358","fourFigureLon":"-1.62792506","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"May 06, 2019","datefound2":"August 06, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Bedwyn","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM516912.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"51.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
