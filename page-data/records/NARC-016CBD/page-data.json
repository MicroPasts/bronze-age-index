The object has a leaf-shaped blade and is sub-circular in cross section with a central rib running down to the blade and extending into the shaft and socket. All edges of the blade have portions missing due to breaks and abrasion and there is a transverse break approximately half way down the length of the blade. The socket is circular and hollow and tapers in from the base to the blade. There are two loops on opposing sides of the socketed end, in line with the casting seams. These loops are slightly flattened on the outside to make them appear lozenge shaped. There is a break across the mid-section of the socket and loops. \n\n\n\nLength: 122.64mm, Width (socket): 13.34mm, Width (blade tip): 4.57mm, Thickness: 10.02mm, Weight: 32.1g\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark green in colour with areas of light green corrosion. The object has a predominantly smooth patina. \n\n\n\nA similar spearhead is illustrated by C. N. Moore and M. Rowlands (1972) in the Salisbury Museum Bronze Age metalwork catalogue (plate XI, no. 57) and recorded as Greenwell and Brewis Class IV. \n\n\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (1500 - 1150 BC).This object is therefore likely to be of a similar date.\n\n\n\nOther examples can be found on PAS database as ESS-A7B5E4 and KENT-350034.","fourFigureLat":"52.16067243","fourFigureLon":"-0.14478812","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Little Gransden","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"South Cambridgeshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC016CBD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"122.64"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
