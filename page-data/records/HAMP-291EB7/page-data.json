This flanged example is characteristic of the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage.  The blade terminates in a wide, crescentic curved cutting edge with rounded terminals.  Bevelling to create the edge is shallow, beginning just below the line of the terminals.  The flanged sides give the artefact a rounded 'H-shaped' cross section.  They feature flange facets in profile.  They are up to 13.95mm thick, and rise up above the septum by c. 3.5mm at the crests.  The body of the axe is broken towards the haft end. Where it survives the patina is a dark green colour.  Otherwise the axe has suffered corrosion, in lighter hues, and more active damage which is a brighter green; the pitting and scratches are considerable in places.","fourFigureLat":"51.058661","fourFigureLon":"-1.373548","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"October 06, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hursley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-291EB7flataxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"80.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
