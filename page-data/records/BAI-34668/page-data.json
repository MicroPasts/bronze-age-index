Decorated with 7 unornamented ribs, between which are bars decorated with rope work. The complete terminal boss has its upper surface decorated with a central spike, & 14 small knobs surrounded by concentric circles. The lower plate of the terminal discs are decorated with 5 rows of circular knobs, each row being divided by rope work. The end of the gorget was passed into a slit at the back of the lower disc, where it was attached by a corrugated line burnished into a corresponding one in the collar. The wire stitchings now to be seen, do not appear to be ancient.","fourFigureLat":"52.92320505","fourFigureLon":"-8.16211629392626","fromdate":null,"todate":null,"notes":null,"materialTerm":null,"identifier":null,"datefound1":null,"datefound2":null,"subsequentActionTerm":null,"recorder":null,"gridSource":null,"quantity":"NA","height":null,"diameter":null,"edge":"","thickness":"","discoveryContext":"","parish":"","county":"County Tipperary","district":"","regionName":null,"country":"Ireland","patina":"","surface":"","other":"","composition":"gold","associations":"","publications":"","inputBy":"Denis Antoine","imageURL":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7612/16632603428_b0104159ba_b.jpg","flickrURL":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/115096994@N02/16632603428","project":"irishGold","rightCorner":"","collection":"National Museum of Science & Art, Dublin, Plate VIII, 41, W 16.","site":"Ireland, Co Tipperary, near Nenagh, Ardcrony, found a spade's depth under the surface of a bog,","toSearch":"Ardcrony, Co.
