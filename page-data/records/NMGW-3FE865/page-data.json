The rear of the fitting has a central integral loop with a length of 10.17mm, a maximum width of 7.52mm (minimum width 3.17mm) and a depth of 3.68mm (2.3mm internal). The surface of the rear is coarse and unfinished. The rear is concave and displays a cast 'channel' for guiding a thin strap, the interior of the cannel is more even than the surrounding surface. The front of the fitting comprises two raised concentric circles and a central knop, divided by cast rounded channels. The head has a thickness of 3.9mm. The edge of the fitting is rounded and the central knop projects slightly above the raised circles, giving the fitting a maximum depth of 6.95mm. The fitting has areas of good surface preservation with a mid-brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"These fittings are unusual finds and can be paralleled with examples in a hoard of Late Bronze Age decorative strap fittings and horse-gear found at Abergele, Conwy (Savory, 1980, pp 119, Nos. 269-271) of Wilberton metalworking phase, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 6 dated to, to c. 1,150 - 950BC. A close parallel may be seen in an example recovered from a 9th to 7th century BC context in Wiltshire and in Wiltshire Heritage Museum , published by Read (2005, pp1, No. 2) . The Wilshire example has lost its loop, which appears to have been slight and more delicate than this example.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20.97","edge":null,"thickness":"3.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006551.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"10.17"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
