The find consists of the body and blade of a socketed axehead: the moulding around the mouth of the axehead has broken off, and therefore cannot be used to date the artefact more closely. The mouth is sub-rectangular and measures 24.66mm wide and 15.55mm thick externally. The total remaining socket depth is approximately 29.15mm. The body of the axehead widens gradually, and has smooth faces and sides, with no prominent face edges or casting seams. The blade width is 37.55mm and there is no blade tip expansion beyond this. The cutting edge has not been bevelled. The axehead is in good condition, and has a uniform pale olive green patina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 62.63mm; width: 37.55mm; thickness: 15.55mm; weight: 94.42g.","fourFigureLat":"51.106508","fourFigureLon":"1.198475","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kate Sumnall","datefound1":"March 13, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kate Sumnall","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.55","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Capel-le-Ferne","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ksumnall/Preece - BA axe - Mar 10.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of London","length":"62.63"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
