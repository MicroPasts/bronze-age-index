This style / type of axe has a common distribution in the East of England. The majority of axes of this style have historically been found in the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire. The distribution pattern continues to a lesser degree in South-East England (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981: 211). However, a number of Meldreth Type axes have been found in hoards associated with South-Wales Types and Ewart Park Swords, for example the Stogursey Hoard, Somerset (ibid, 210). This is reflected in a local Marches distribution where they have been treated as exotics occurring in a Ewart Park phase hoard from Pencoyd, Herefordshire (HESH-802833) and a broken and damaged faceted axe from Westbury, Shropshire (HESH-F8A521).","fourFigureLat":"52.44605856","fourFigureLon":"-0.63310567","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-600","notes":"Found very close to BH-A50566 (2013T655) and BH-0E91D6.
