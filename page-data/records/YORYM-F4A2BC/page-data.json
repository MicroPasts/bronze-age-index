Only the cutting edge remains. The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan, sub-rectangular in profile, and triangular in section. The fragment is hollow with an internal triangular recess tapering to a point towards the cutting edge. The edges and faces of the axehead fragment are smooth and precise. The break is uneven and runs diagonally down the body of the axehead. Unfortunately not enough remains of the axehead to be able to identify it more precisely or attribute a closer date.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a green patina. The axehead fragment is 27.6mm in length, 44.0mm in width, 12.5mm thick, and weighs 39.9g.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects have been recorded on the database as YORYM-F04668, NLM-3CB08D, LVPL-653004, and YORYM-B41E65.","fourFigureLat":"53.86676196","fourFigureLon":"-0.66326058","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Emily Tilley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Emily Tilley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Market Weighton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ertilley/CW0453.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"27.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
