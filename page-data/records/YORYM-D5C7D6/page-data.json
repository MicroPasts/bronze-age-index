The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow and thin butt end which extends to a curved cutting edge with splayed blade. Raised flanges are present along the edges of both sides of the axehead each showing signs of heavy wear. No casting flashes are visible though this may be due to the advance nature of the corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid brownish-green patina and is worn. The axehead is 112mm long, 35.2mm wide at the blade, 17.5mm wide at the butt end, 14.4mm thick and weighs 121g. The flanges are 57.6mm long extending from the butt end to midway along the body.","fourFigureLat":"53.8060404","fourFigureLon":"-0.87779319","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bubwith","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/JL0012a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"112"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
