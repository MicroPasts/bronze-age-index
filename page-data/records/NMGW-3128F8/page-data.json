At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket of sub-rectangular form (26.7mm x 5.5mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 2.4mm), broken in antiquity. A small length of the sides survive (24-5mm), which appear slightly bevelled towards a raised central ridge, which comprises the finished casting seams. The surviving sides are near-straight and slightly divergent to the blade tips (with a surviving blade edge width of 40.0mm). The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded but has a slight curved edge (with a surviving depth of 5mm). The surviving blade faces are very slightly convex across both their lengths and widths. There are no ribs evident on the surviving faces. The surfaces are corroded with a partially preserved dark-green patina and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.","fourFigureLat":"51.55001717","fourFigureLon":"-3.06863188","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Michaelstone-y-Fedw","county":"Newport","district":"Newport","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20188axefrag.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"29.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
