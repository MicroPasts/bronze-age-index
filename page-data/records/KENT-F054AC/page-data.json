In plan the blade remains very narrow for the type and the flaring a crescentic cutting edge appears to have been worn down. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners . It has a raised double collar, the outer band of whcih is mostly worn or broken away, what remains is obscured by wear and corrosion as is the lower band. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have been worked down either through hammering or filing/polishing, particularly towards the blade end perhaps suggesting extensive sharpening of the blade, perhaps indicating why the blade is so short. Part of side of the axehead is broken away and the axe has some advanced corrosion particularly towards the butt end of one of the faces. It has a more even patination towards the blade edge.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length of 73.62mm, with a width (at widest) 31.35mm wide, thickness 31.05mm and a weight: 75.9g","fourFigureLat":"51.18652316","fourFigureLon":"1.23264163","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eythorne","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTF054AC.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"73.62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
