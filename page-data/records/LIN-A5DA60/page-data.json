Only a fragment of the butt-end survives. The fragment is rectangular in plan and triangular in section. It has wide flanges on both sides at the break giving the axe an 'H'-shaped section, and these flanges taper to the butt. The break is irregular and well patinated, suggesting that it occured by accident in antiquity. The surface is mottled green and pitted with areas of corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe length of the axe is 25mm, the width is 26mm. Each flange extends 2mm at the break. The body is 8mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1] from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
