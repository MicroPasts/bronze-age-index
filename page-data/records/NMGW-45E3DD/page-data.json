The break occurred in antiquity and at the break, the axe body is slender and of sub-rectangular section (with a width of 22.3mm and a thickness of 8.9mm). The sides diverge moderately (for 24mm) before expanding sharply to produce an expanded blade edge (with a width of 50.0mm and an expanded edge length of 17mm). The faces are flat across their widths and also their lengths before a curved blade facet (19mm from the blade edge), positioned at the point where the blade is expanded. The edges of the faces appear to have slight ridges, seemingly the remnant ends of corroded flanges. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with no original surface surviving. But has a mid to bright green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe probable presence of flanges on the edges of the face would suggest the axehead was of a developed type. The fragmentary condition of the axehead makes further typological identification difficult and speculative. The slender body expanding sharply to a possible recurved blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 65-8)[1]. Developed Flat axes relate to Metalworking Assemblages IV -V and date to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, dated to c. 2050 – 1700BC. Type Bandon Axes probably relate to the Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V) with a proposed date range of c. 1900 – 1600BC. \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
