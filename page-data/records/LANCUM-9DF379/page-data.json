The copper is not sheet metal and appears to have been cast as one piece as part of a larger object. It is not yet known what this object was. It should be possible to refine the dating once the charcoal samples are dated from the burnt mound which was the subject of an evaluation associated with treasure case 2016 T518 database number LANCUM-A5AF1B.
