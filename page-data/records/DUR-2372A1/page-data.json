The object is broken across the lower blade and the tang and butt of the blade are preserved. The blade would have been lanceolate in shape (being broadly triangular in plan) and has a pronounced, raised central rib terminating at the junction with the tang. This rib is present on both faces of the blade. The cross section of the blade is lentoid (lanceolate). The tang is integrally cast and rectangular in shape; it tapers toward the butt end where the lower edge is broken across a oval shaped rivet hole. Sub rectangular depressions are present on both faces on the upper part of the tang. The outer edges of the blade are heavily abraded and both the ends of the object terminate in old patinated but abraded breaks. The metal is a mid-brown in colour with a thick well preserved surface patina on most faces; where abrasion has removed this patina patches of light green, pitted corrosion are present. This form of spearhead is relatively rare with only 47 examples recorded in the recent volume British Bronze Age Spearheads (Davis 2012). This form of spearhead corresponds with  Davis's (2012) Group I form and of Arreton Down metalworking dating to the latest part of the Early Bronze Age, (Early Bronze Age III) which correspondes to Needham's (1996) Period 4 dated c. 1700 - 1500BC and Burgess's Metalworking stage VII.  Two similar examples of Arreton metalworking tradition spearheads are recorded on the PAS database from Penllyn, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0BF252) and Shalfleet, Isle of Wight (IOW-221956) . \n\n\n\nAn image of this was sent to Richard Davis (University of Nottingham) who comments:\n\n\n\n[This is an] Arreton tanged spearhead. However some of its attributes do not match any of the 47 that I have recorded in the PBF book. The blade base has a protruding ridge or rib which is not present on other tanged spearheads. This, however, is found on some of the early socketed spearheads (Arreton phase). The narrow vertical, central rib on the blade is not present on other tanged spearheads, but again this attribute is similar to some on the early socketed spearheads. The indentation on the upper face of the tang is unique. It may have been designed as a seating for some form of bronze collar which also abutted the ridged blade base (see the well known Snowshill spearhead). The length of the tang and the broken peg hole is typical of the tanged spearheads of this type\n\n\n\nLength: 92.01mm, Width: 23.51mm, Thickness: 8.84m, Width (of tang): 13.03mm, Thickness (of tang) : 6.76m Weight: 39.5 grams.\n\n\n\nThanks are extended to Richard Davis for his comprehensive and useful notes. This find has been noted of Regional Importance.","fourFigureLat":"54.23706997","fourFigureLon":"-0.83544522","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Ellie Cox","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.84","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aislaby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox/DUR2372A1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"92.01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
