The first two finds were c.30cm below the surface and the soil around them dark in colour. Archaeological advice has been sought.\n\n\n\n1) The copper alloy arm-ring has lost all of its original surface patina. It currently measures max.79.5mm in diameter (internal 54.6mm) and weighs 99.08g. It has an apparently circular cross-section.\n\n\n\n2) The copper alloy socketed hammer is missing most of its socket but retains the blade. The socket has a circular cross-section (26.5mm diameter), the walls of which are 4.5mm wide, and the solid blade below has a rectangular cross-section, 23.5x23.3mm below the socket and thinning to 23.5x14.7mm at the hammering end. It is missing all of its original patina. The incomplete object measures 83.4mm in length and weighs 162g (to the nearest 2g). The finder reports this object was lying flat to one face when found.\n\n\n\n3) The piece of metalworking debris is apparently copper alloy but is rather light (13.89g) with several popped air bubbles visible on the surface. The surface is otherwise quite lumpy. It measures 25.9x19.2x(max.)16.1mm.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nGiven the close proximity of the first two finds, it is highly likely these are part of an undisturbed hoard and date to the 'Ornament Horizon' of the Taunton metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1400-1250 BC). A larger hoard from Hampshire (2017 T160 / SUR-590F5D) features three Liss type arm-rings (with herringbone decoration) alongside several other ornaments, a palstave axehead and a socketed hammer. Unfortunately it is impossible to tell whether the arm-ring in this hoard was originally decorated.","fourFigureLat":"50.97344355","fourFigureLon":"-0.81921691","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"August 03, 2019","datefound2":"August 03, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"3","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Elsted and Treyford","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP3CFD2Da.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
