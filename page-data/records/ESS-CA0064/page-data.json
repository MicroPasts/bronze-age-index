This fragment is subrectangular in plan with a lentoid section. Both broken ends are straight, as if the blade has been deliberately broken, possibly for its inclusion in a scrap hoard. The object is slightly bent, supporting this theory. The narrowness of the fragment suggests it has come from the pointed end of a weapon, possibly a spearhead. The fragment is abraded. Where the original surface survives, it has a dark green patina, but is otherwise mid green in colour. It has a surviving length of 34.02mm, is 16.98mm wide, 3.76mm thick and weighs 10.49g.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Essex","district":"","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/Wood Ba frag.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"34.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
