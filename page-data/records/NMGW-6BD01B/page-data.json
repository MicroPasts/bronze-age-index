The type is uncertain, but probably South Wales (Stogursey) Type of Ewart Park metalworking industry dated to c.950-750 BC, but possibly of Wilburton-Wallington through to Llyn Fawr industries dating to c.1150-600 BC. \n\n\n\nThe axehead is represented by the end of the blade only with a straight transverse break across its width resulting in a surviving length of 32.3mm. The break happened in antiquity and is likely evidence for deliberate breakage of the object prior to deposition, or ‘ritual killing’. The width at the break is 33.2mm (11.8mm thick) with traces of the hollow ovoid socket surviving (internal dimensions of the remaining socket 23mm x 6.9mm ). The sides are bevelled toward their centre with casting seams running along their surviving centre, terminating c.6.6mm before the blade edge. One casting seam has been damaged by corrosion, but the surviving seam suggests that it was finished. The blade edge has a slight expansion and possibly uneven curve, although damage to the original surface makes it difficult to tell for certain. The blade edge has a medium curvature (max width 36.3mm) with some damage to the original surface edge. The faces of the axe are gradually convergent and very slightly convex with the end of a single raised rib decoration preserving on one face (surviving rib length 7.8mm from the break). Some striations from sharpening are suggested, mostly concentrated on one face. The surface has a dark brown patina with areas of damage revealing bright green bronze corrosion beneath. The fragment weighs 39.72g.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form indicates a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form, scale and ribbed decoration suggest the axe to be of South Wales or allied type and of Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC). The inward hammered at the break would suggest deliberate damage prior to deposition.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects are recorded on the PAS database e.g. NMGW-EEFAFA, NMGW-31C923, NMGW-32296E, NMGW-219CA8","fourFigureLat":"51.49359371","fourFigureLon":"-3.3121938","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adelle Bricking","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adelle Bricking","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Fagans","county":"Cardiff","district":"Cardiff","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/NMGW6BD01Bdylanaxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
