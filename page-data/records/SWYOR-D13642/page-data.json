It has a length of 65.30mm, width 19.50mm and a weight of 102.64g. The hammer has a rectangular section. The rounded open end has a raised collar which surrounds it. Two small raised points protrude from the top, just below the collar.  These are the remains of a loop, probably to help attach the hammer to the haft. The object is filled with soil but would have been hollow. The rectangular end looks to have been used to strike objects as it is damaged, and the copper has started to fold over at the edges. Similar examples can be seen on the database: SUSS-2D5992 or HAMP-1F3730. Further examples are also illustrated in The Handbook of British Archaeology (Roberts forthcoming) and Worrell 2004, Bronze Age Training notes (unpublished). The hammer probably dates from 1500 â€“ 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.74668928","fourFigureLon":"-1.36461751","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"July 08, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kippax","county":"Leeds","district":"Leeds","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_686_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"65.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
