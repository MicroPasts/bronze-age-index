The cutting edge is curved and the 'corners' of it splayed. Both faces are heavily pitted and a bluey-green in colour. The base of the socket measures 28.6mm in length and 1.5mm in width at the worn break, which shows a lentoid or elongated pointed-oval cross-section. The fragment measures 19.8mm in length, 49.8mm in max.width, 8.9mm in max.thickness (at the break), 1.3mm in min.thickness (at the cutting edge) and weighs 29.38g.","fourFigureLat":"50.81572781","fourFigureLon":"-1.34841247","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"The socketed form of the axe suggests a Late Bronze Age date c.1150-800 BC, likely of the Wilburton or Ewart Park metalworking tradition.
