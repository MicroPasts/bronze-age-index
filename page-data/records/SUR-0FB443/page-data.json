The spear has rounded edges and one side has seven nicks which create seven 'barbs'.\n\n\n\nRichard Davis comments that he has not seen a fragment like this before. He notes:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. It is not clear what type of spearhead this is - whether it had loops or pegholes in the socket, and whether it is from the Middle or Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n2. Cuts in the blade edges are normally the result of combat damage or an intentional \"killing\" of the spearhead prior to votive deposition. Excellent examples of this \"killing\" is found in some of the spearheads from the Blackmoor Hoard, also from Hampshire. However, intentional cuts in blade edges are normally found in spearheads that are deposited when complete or with a large part remaining, not just as a fragment as in this case.\n\n\n3. The multiple cuts on one blade edge look decorative - the upper four cuts are at regular intervals. The reworking may have been to form a tool, but this seems unlikely as the jagged edges are not sharp. The apparent barb on the other blade edge does not seem to have a particular function.\n\n\nIn summary,the probability is that it is a fragment of an LBA pegged spearhead, because the incidence of intentional fragments was far greater in this period. This is an interesting and unique piece, but one whose condition and damage is difficult to interpret.","fourFigureLat":"51.04918","fourFigureLon":"-1.288079","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Richard Davis","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.75","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chilcomb","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/margaretb/12-1344a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"49.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
