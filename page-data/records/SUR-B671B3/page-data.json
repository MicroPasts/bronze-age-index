The remains of two rivet holes survive only partially on the upper heavily worn and eroded external edge of the hilt. The hilt is broadly is trapezoidal in shape. The width of the blade at the break is 16.79mm and the measurement between the rivet holes is 25.89mm. There is no evidence of a raised or cast mid-rib to the blade\n\n\n\nThe distinction between dirks and rapiers is difficult when the fragment is as small as this example - the main difference between a dirk and a rapier is that a Rapier is over 30cm long and therefore considered to be more of a thrusting weapon whilst a Dirk is under 30cm and so more useful for stabbing. However it is often difficult to identify whether a blade is a dirk or a rapier as they are frequently found in a fragmentary state. From the size of this example it is more likely to have been from a dirk (dagger). Good PAS examples can be seen from Bampton, Oxfordshire (GLO-036A39), and Flawborough, Nottinghamshire (DENO-C2BC23). The findspot of this example - in the environs and watercatchment area of the River Mole - is common for such metalwork.","fourFigureLat":"51.31049348","fourFigureLon":"-0.4232012","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Margaret Broomfield","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.38","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cobham and Downside","county":"Surrey","district":"Elmbridge","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/17944.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"64.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
