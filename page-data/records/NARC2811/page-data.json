There is a triple  mouth-moulding, of which the upper moulding is much more prominent, while the lowest gives rise to a half-circular loop on one side of the body. In cross-section the body is sub-rectangular, the aperture being almost square, narrowing downwards to a blunt end. In plan the body runs parallel for most of its length expanding from about two-thirds of the way down to the cutting edge which forms a very shallow curve which is slightly more crescentic than the other three similar axeheads in this hoard. In profile the axehead forms a long narrow triangle, with a casting ridge visible on both sides. On the face with the loop this ridge runs in an uninterrupted seam through the outside of the loop.","fourFigureLat":"50.661382","fourFigureLon":"-1.124177","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Part of a hoard of eleven implements.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"","datefound1":"February 01, 2002","datefound2":"March 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"44.25","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Sandown","county":"Isle of Wight","district":"Isle of Wight","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sworrell/IOW2002-26 Kirkton Hoard.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Finder","length":"132.86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
