The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 20.4 mm (thickness: 4.8 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.1 mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 35.5 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead. The axe is a mid to dark green to brown in colour colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 81.39 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 35.5 mm, width at the butt is 20.4 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 9.1 mm. It weighs 71.9 grams.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped. These axes fit within metalworking stage IV, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Migdale Variant Biggar (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 18-19. 220 Knapton or 231 Brubster).\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
