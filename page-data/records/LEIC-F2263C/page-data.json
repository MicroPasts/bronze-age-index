This has flanged sides, which emerge from the butt end and widen until the object is 17mm thick at the point that these turn to form a stop. From here the object narrows out in thickness and widens out into a triangular shaped blade with a slightly curved edge. At the tip it is 57mm wide and 4mm thick. Each edge of the blade has a slight rounded lip and there is a rounded 'rib' running from the centre, where it emerges from the 'stop' dispaearring into the blade surface near its tip.\n\n\n\nThe object is probably an unlooped mid rib palstave and is similar to e.g. 157 p. 105  in National Museum of Wales Bronze Age catalogue.","fourFigureLat":"52.50561189","fourFigureLon":"-1.26479165","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"April 03, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Joyce Lee","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Frolesworth","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Harborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jmlarch84/LEICF2263C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"122"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
