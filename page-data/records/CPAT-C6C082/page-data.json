In this instance, the blade has no flare to the tips and a cutting edge of 62mm against the width of 53.8mm; it was therefore, a substantial axe.  There are no visible mould marks to the sides.  The socket, or what remains of it, is a flat sided oval in form.  There is little of the original surface remaining and that which does remain, is in poor condition.  However, in that surface, there is evidence of use with vertical gouges and what might be horizontal striations from sharpening.  One side has some unusual looking marks just above the cutting edge; there are three triangular etchings and other small nondescript cross cuts.  Although they may simply be the effects of time on the decomposing surface, they do look deliberate.   The remnant is now heavily corroded and fragile and has a light to mid green colouration.","fourFigureLat":"52.745938","fourFigureLon":"-3.053219","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"March 31, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llandrinio","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2890-0003.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"37.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
