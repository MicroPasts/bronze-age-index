Both edges are still sharp although quite uneven and the surface of the object is badly abraded and the object is quite poorly preserved more generally. The axehead is rounded at one end, the cutting edge, and the axe then tapers towards the butt. The axe is quite thin and does not vary much in thickness although the middle is slightly thicker than the outer edges. There is no evidence for decoration on the surface of the object but that could be due to the fact that the surface has corroded away completely. The object is purpley-brown in colour with areas of a light green corrosion.\n\n\nIt is likely that this dates to the Early Bronze Age and metalworking stage I to II which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2, circa 2500 to 2050 CAL. BC. Axes of this type are broadly contemporary with beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.","fourFigureLat":"54.512304","fourFigureLon":"-2.016957","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lauren Proctor","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lauren Proctor","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bowes","county":"County Durham","district":"County Durham","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/a8622912/DUR-065531-flat-axehad-back.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"94.87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
