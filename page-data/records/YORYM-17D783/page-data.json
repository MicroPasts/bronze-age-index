The two pieces fit together to form a blade that expands outwards from its pointed terminal before narrowing again. Worn breaks are present where the point has broken off, at the line of impact where the two pieces have separated and at the terminal which would have been closest to the grip. Corrosion is present in patches over the surface on both sides and the edges are very worn. The sword has a wide central ridge down its length and a lozengiform cross section which narrows in thickness towards the point. A brown and green patina is present on the surface.\n\n\n\nAlthough most of the diagnostic features have been lost, the 'tongue-like' form of the blade suggests an Ewart Park or Wilburton type (Dot Boughton and Peter Reavill pers comm). \n\n\n\nPiece A measures 162.35mm in length, 37.75mm in width at its widest, 12.21mm in width at its narrowest, 8.06mm in thickness at its thickest (the middle point of its cross section) and weighs 168g.\n\n\n\nPiece B measures 63.88mm in length, 36.27mm at its widest, 29.86mm at its narrowest, 8.46mm inthickness at its thickest (the middle point of its cross section) and weighs 81g.\n\n\n\nCf.
