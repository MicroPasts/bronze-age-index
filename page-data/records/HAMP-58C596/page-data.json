The artefact is sub-rectangular in shape and a shallow U-shaped in cross-section at one end, becoming circular at the other. One end is open (socketed) and there is a recess extending from this end into the body of the object which has a dark orange-brown mineralisation within the socket similar to DOR-FD5EF4 on this database. The artefact has a dark-brown patina in places, the majority on the concave recess and partially over the semicircular curve. There is evidence of pitting and the metal now has a light-mid green colour as it has suffered from bronze disease.","fourFigureLat":"51.280346","fourFigureLon":"-0.940408","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Richard Henry","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"November 16, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Richard Henry","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hook","county":"Hampshire","district":"Hart","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-58C596gouge.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"54.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
