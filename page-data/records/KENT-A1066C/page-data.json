In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is missing due to an old and abraded break however what remains tapers inward toward the butt end.The metal is brown in colour with areas of light green corrosion. The object has a heavily pitted green and mottled brown patinated surface.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 43.76mm long, 63.21mm wide, 10.62mm thick and 132g in weight.\n\n\n\nThis axehead resembles those described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.41243888","fourFigureLon":"0.8458364","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-2050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mags Erwin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mags Erwin","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.62","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Minster-on-Sea","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTA1066C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"43.76"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
