The fragment is triangular with a sharp point at the tip. It is 63.8mm long, 27mm wide and 7.9mm thick. There is a central ridge along the blade which is slightly rounded. The section is thus a vertical oval with tapering side flanges rather than a lozenge shape. Near the break there are grooves on the central ridge forming an arrow pointing towards the tip. These are on both sides. These mouldings are quite unusual. Similar decoration is known on some Bronze Age and Iron Age transition pieces. An example with similar mouldings is from the Melksham Hoard and is held by Devizes Museum, but a middle Bronze Age date is considered to be the most likely for this example.. The broken end does not have a good a patina as the rest of the object, but the break does not seem to be recent. The rest of the object has a glossy golden brown patina with a few pits of corrosion. A similar example recorded on the database is LANCUM-37A3C5.","fourFigureLat":"54.052089","fourFigureLon":"-1.32942","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"March 31, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Ouseburn","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 518 spear tip.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"63.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
