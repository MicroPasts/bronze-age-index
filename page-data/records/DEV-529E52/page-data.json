The butt is relatively long and slim, and would once have had ridges on either side, although these have been damaged post depositionally and are now reduced to slight raised areas on either side of the butt. Similarly, on one side the base of a loop is just visible, but the loop is now destroyed. On both faces, at the point where where the butt meets the stop there is a small horizontal groove, but it is not clear whether this is part of the design or the result of damage. The object is covered in a dark green patina, although some areas of the original brownish colour survive with pocks and scores in the surface indicative of damage.\n\n\n\nIt is similar to IOW-8A6D18, but NMS-1719F0 is a better parallel which is in far superior condition and has the loop surviving.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 129.2mm length 38.9mm width,15.8mm thickness.","fourFigureLat":"50.92831346","fourFigureLon":"-3.19661323","fromdate":"1400","todate":"1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"February 01, 2019","datefound2":"April 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clayhidon","county":"Devon","district":"Mid Devon","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV529E52.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"129.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
