The spear head is ogival in shape, with a raised triangular sectioned mid rib running down either side of the blade. Just before the blade widens there is a shallow dip on the mid rib on either side. The tip of the spear head is missing, and the edges of the blade is worn and broken. In cross section the shaft is lozenge shaped, with the flat wings of the blade extending out on each side. One edge of the socket is slightly thicker, making the socket slightly offset. The blade narrows towards the blade-socket junction, then extends into the socket. There is a worn break across the socket, which would have fitted over the haft. It is also possible that it was pegged, however this is part is now missing. The almost diamond-shaped midrib cross section may suggest a very late date in the Bronze Age or possibly an Earliest Iron Age date, i.e. 8th century. The spearhead measures 57.9mm in length, 17.9mm in width, and 8.6mm at maximum thickness along the mid rib. The socket measures 6.1mm in diameter. It weighs 14.65g.","fourFigureLat":"51.71199276","fourFigureLon":"-0.94482772","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"February 03, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"6.1","edge":null,"thickness":"8.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chinnor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC8CCAA3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"57.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
