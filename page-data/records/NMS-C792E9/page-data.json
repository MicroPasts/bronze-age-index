Only the central section survives with a loop on the underside of the flanged body and old brittle fractures at either end where the butt end and majority of the remarkably thin axe blade have broken away. The wings are long with the ends turning sharply inwards towards each other to secure the original haft. No stop ridges. Dark brown water patina with casting seams largely removed. Penard to Ewart park metalwork phases circa 1300-800 BC. A similar and more complete axe can be seen at BH-BE3C94 on the Portable Antiquities Database.","fourFigureLat":"52.39723355","fourFigureLon":"1.0264194","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"There is a strong hoard association with axes of this type and although it forms part of a growing Bronze Age landscape in the vicinity it is currently (Oct 2020) too isolated to be considered for Treasure.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"September 18, 2019","datefound2":"September 18, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bressingham","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/63989_C792E9_BA_Palstave.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"73"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
