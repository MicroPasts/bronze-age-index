The palstave is in good condition but broken behind the stopridge, most of the rectangular cross-sectioned butt is missing. It has a single, well formed side loop. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which shows marks of hammering. On both sides there is a thin median rib from the stop ridge to the blade facet.\n\n\n\nThe object is an early/primary looped palstave (group III) with a mid-rib, dating to the Acton Park II to Taunton to early Penard phase of metalwork (1450 - 1200 BC). The blade facet shows ripples from the metal being drawn down through hammering to sharpen the blade. The surface of the rest of the blade, on all four sides, has many small indents that appear to be decorative.\n\n\n\nThe patina of the axe is almost complete. One face of the axe has a distinctive light blue to turquoise colour while the other is a darker green. The break appears old and has developed a green patina. The surface of the break is pitted and has several deep indents, formed by air bubbles in the alloy as the object was being cast.\n\n\n\nA similar object is illustrated in Rowlands 1976 Fig 3, Plate 54 (Eglesham Meadows hoard).\n\n\n\nOverall length 95.4 mm. Width at butt 23.4 mm, at blade 63.7 mm. Thickness 31.3 mm at stopridge, tapering to 1.0 mm at blade edge.
