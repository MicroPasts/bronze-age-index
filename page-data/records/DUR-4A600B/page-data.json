This object is probably a Schmidt and Burgess Type Ulrome, No. 542 (1981: plate 43).\n\n\n\nThe axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow, squared butt end which is wedge-shaped in section, tapering at the terminal. There are four individual flanges, on the front and back of the axehead and either side. The flanges start near the butt end, where they gradually curve upwards in profile and are thicker in section towards the crest. The crest of the flanges are a rounded point. After the crest, each flange becomes thicker in section and slopes downwards in profile, more abruptly compared to the other side of the crest. This side of each flange is curved inwards to the centre of the object, with a slight internal ridge. On the exterior profile of the flanges, on both sides of the axehead, there are two lengthwise ridges which run along the base of each flange, tapering towards the butt end. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body of the axehead. Although there is a lack of a defined stop ridge to secure the handle, there is a slight ridge which starts at the end of the thicker, curved side of the flanges and it is curved towards the butt end. This curved ridge is more apparent on one side of the axehead than the other, due to the level or corrosion on this object. The side with the more clear curved ridge, also has two ridges which start at the end of the flanges and form a point, facing the blade end of the object. These ridges, along with the curved ridge, form a triangle with a curved base shape on the body of the axehead. After the flanges, the body of the axehead gradually widens in plan and curves outwards, relatively close to the terminal of the blade end. The section of the body gradually tapers towards the blade end. The plan of the blade is crescent shaped and is chipped in several places along the blade edge.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is in a fair condition, with most of the detail and dark green patina being visible. The surface of the object is pitted with evidence of active bronze disease and has some patches of orange-brown.\n\n\n\nIt is 132.81mm in length, 47.33mm in width at the blade end, 22.27mm in width at the butt end, 30.84mm thick at the flanges and 13.48mm thick at the mid-pont of the body.\n\n\n\nAnother flanged axehead which is similar to this object was recorded by the Durham Portable Antiquities Scheme: DUR-41AE2E. Other examples on the PAS database include: IOW-DC1AD8; LANCUM-B39815; SWYOR-BAA720; and DENO-D22101. This axehead is possibly Schmidt and Burgess Type Ulrome, with No. 542 being the closest parallel as it has the same profile shape and has similar ridges on the body, a triangle with a curved base, as well as the ridges on the side of the flanges match this object (1981: plate 43).\n\n\n\n(Schmidt, P.K., Burgess, C., 1981.
