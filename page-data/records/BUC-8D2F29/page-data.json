The axe is rectangular is shape in the body, widening slightly towards the cutting edge, which is sub-circular and curved. A hammered and trimmed casting seam is visible. In profile the cutting edge narrows to a rounded point, it is narrow which suggests that it is probably a transitional palstave. In cross section the axe head is triangular in shape. There is a worn break across the body of the axe head, which is rectangular in cross section. The axe head has a dark green patina. The palstave measures 32.0,mm in length, 28.4mm in width across the blade, 30.2mm in width across the body, 16.3mm in maximum thickness, and weighs 105g.","fourFigureLat":"51.71186194","fourFigureLon":"-0.93035683","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-2300","notes":"The style of the cutting edge corresponds with the Taunton and Penard assemblages (predominately Taunton) - which fits into Needham periodisation as Period 5 (Burgess Metalworking stage IX).
