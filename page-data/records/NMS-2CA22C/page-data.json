Narrow-bodied with a square mouth and socket bordered by a deep, flat collar, now damaged. There is an irregular hole in one side of the body. Straight-sided, it remains uniform in width from just below the socket mouth until it expands into the flared cutting edge. It tapers in thickness from 18mm below the collar to 3mm at the cutting edge. The cutting edge itself is heavily chipped. A casting seam is visible along each side.\n\n\n\nApart from the tip of the blade, which exhibits a shiny, dark green patina, the surface is pitted and covered in corrosion product.\n\n\n\nSimilar in form to: WILT-C4C954 & IOW-C48CB1. \n\n\n\nBrendan O'Connor comments there is a small group of similar slender socketed axeheads from East Dorset (A Group of Middle Bronze Age Socketed Axes from East Dorset, Brendan O'Connor and Peter J. Woodward, PDNHAS 125, 2003, 144-6), and another in the Salisbury hoard. \n\n\n\nLength: 80mm, width of mouth: 27mm, minimum width: 21.5mm, width of blade: 28mm.
