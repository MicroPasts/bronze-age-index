The axe head has a lenticular profile with a convex section/ thickness at the sides. The parallel sides are particularly straight, although they expand outwards with a protruding blade tip to either side. Although most of the original cutting edge survives, the probable blade facets are not particularly noticeable. The artefact is in a worn but fair condition with a mid-brown patina. The length is 100mm, the width blade is 54mm, width butt 34mm, thickness 20mm and the weight 184.94g. The axe probably fits into the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC, or slightly later. This is a small, flat axe that is most plausibly early in the period, c.2550-1600 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.84663226","fourFigureLon":"-2.38146836","fromdate":"-2550","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"September 25, 2016","datefound2":"September 25, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"47","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pendleton","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMA6E169.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
