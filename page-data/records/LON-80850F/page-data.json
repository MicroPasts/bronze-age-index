The object is solid cast and roughly cuboidal in shape, tapering from one end to the other. There is a circular socket at the widest end which would have held a wooden or bone handle. The object has a mid-green to mid-brown pattination across the surface and is rather worn, making the edges very rounded.\n\n\n\nA similar example with a rectangular shape and circular socket has been recorded on the PAS database (LVPL-89D1D3). Most published examples have sockets that are the same shape as the object itself. The example on the database is Late Bronze Age in date, making it likely that this example is of a similar date.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 45.12 mm; width: 16.29 mm; socket diameter: 9.64 mm; weight: 40.53g.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ben Paites","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ben Paites","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"9.64","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ksumnall/BA-Aug14.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of London","length":"45.12"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
