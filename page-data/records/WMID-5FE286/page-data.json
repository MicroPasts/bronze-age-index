The axe is broken in two approximately half way down its length and part of the butt is also missing. The blade is worn and damaged and the surface of the axe is also worn and pitted in places. It has a brown patina with green bronze corrosion in places. Together, the two fragments measure 101.40 mm in length. The axe widens from 22.5 mm at the butt end (ignoring the break) to 39.6 mm at the blade end. The axe has a septum for attachment of a haft and this is 17.15 mm wide. The septum terminates in a stop ridge, before the blade of the axe begins. There is no evidence that the axe ever had an attachment loop. Based on the rough surface at the break and a patina here that is inconsistent with the colour of the rest of the axe, this break appears to have occurred relatively recently.\n\n\n\nFind not photographed.","fourFigureLat":"52.89442546","fourFigureLon":"-1.92712395","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2008","datefound2":"January 31, 2008","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.99","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Uttoxeter Rural","county":"Staffordshire","district":"East Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"101.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
