BC 2350 - c. BC 2050). \n\nThe axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid.\n\nThe sides of the axe gently taper outwards with a shallow curve, from the rounded butt to the blade. The curve is less shallow towards the blade. The axehead has suffered significant loss from corrosion on all surfaces, particularly at the blade and the butt.\n\nThe axehead measures 67.4 mm in length, the butt is 18.1 mm wide and the blade measures 27.3 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.8 mm, the ridge measures 10.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 59 g.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
