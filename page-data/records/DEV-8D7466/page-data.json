It remains fairly narrow and rectilinear in shape before flaring to the blade. It is rectangular in cross section, although the blade narrows to its original cutting surface. It appears undecorated but the surface is pitted and marked across the dark green shiny patina. \n\n\n\nIt is similar to DEV-0CAAEF, although slightly shorter in the butt. It is characteristic of south western metalwork from \"metalworking stage II\", which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC) Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015: 87, no. 3, 11, 213) illustrate a number of similar examples from the south western peninsula including Devon and Cornwall. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: 91.9mm length, 38.7mm width, 8.2mm thickness, weight 113.3g","fourFigureLat":"50.69302638","fourFigureLon":"-3.33219725","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-2000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"January 01, 2020","datefound2":"September 11, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Newton Poppleford and Harpford","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV8D7466.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"91.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
