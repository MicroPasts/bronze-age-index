In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentric cutting edge. What is left of the socket is socket is sub-rectangular in cross section. The socket of the axe is sub-rectangular with patinated breaks around all the sides which have removed the original end of the socket and no evidence of the original probable collar remain.The two long sides of the axe are plain and expand towards the blade end and are very slightly concave along the blade end. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have been worked down either through hammering or filing/polishing. The blade edge has some wear but remains in good conditions. One of the wide faces has a slight decorative elongated 'H' shaped depression in it. The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 66.96mm long, 51.36mm wide (27.35mm wide at the butt end), 25.66mm thick and 130.91g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"51.11289473","fourFigureLon":"0.95598952","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25.66","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Smeeth","county":"Kent","district":"Ashford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT0DD8D3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"66.96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
