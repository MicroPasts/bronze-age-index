The fragment is triangular in plan, tapering to the spear's point which remains sharp. It has an oval midrib that is solid and runs to the point of the spear as it tapers in width and depth. From the midrib the blade extends, with each side forming an elongated triangle. The fragment has a shiny dark brown patina. The break at the lower edge is not too recent.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 59mm long, 20.06mm wide, 9.89mm thick and weighs 18.80 grams.\n\n\n\nNot enough of the spearhead has remained to be able to date this fragment to a more precise range.","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"February 11, 2021","datefound2":"December 07, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.89","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ambolton/OXOND6BA74.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"59"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
