The axe has broken near the base of the socket (with a length of 29.0mm, a surviving width of 7mm and a maximum surviving depth of 9mm). The axe is of rectangular section at the break, with convex sides across their thicknesses (where the axe has a width of 49mm and a maximum thickness of 20.3mm). The casting flashes are clear and raised on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The sides curve-out sharply to produce an expanded, recurved edge, although one of the blade tips has been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 70.1mm). The blade faces are convex across both their lengths and width with no discernible blade facets. There are no ribs extending onto the blade fragment and no discernible sharpening striations on the blade edge. There are deep scratches of random direction on both faces which appear to have patinated, suggesting they may have occurred in antiquity. The surface has a dark brown patination.\n\n\nThe blade fragment appears to be from a comparatively substantial axe, although the fragmentary nature makes the typological identification difficult. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although most recovered socketed axes are of Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.4215187","fourFigureLon":"-3.32451035","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 15, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wenvoe","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.5.1i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"38.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
