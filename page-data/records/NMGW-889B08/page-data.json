The artefact is thickest at its middle (at 3.18mm) and thins to the blade and tang end. The sides are divergent and straight along the tang and gently curved along the blade. The blade edge has a width of 16.84mm and is also gently curved. Little of the original surface survives, which appears to have had a black patination. The current surface is mid-green to brown. The chisel weighs 6.2g. Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the chisel was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The object was examined whole within the specimen chamber and analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. A scrape along one edge of the object allowed analysis of the metal in this area. Unfortunately the electron beam was too unsteady to obtain reliable semi-quantitative results, but a series of readings showed that the object was of tin bronze; neither zinc nor lead were present in detectable quantities. The suggested composition would be broadly consistent with Middle Bronze Age metal composition, perhaps Taunton or Cammaes metalworking.","fourFigureLat":"51.464384","fourFigureLon":"-3.498502","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"This chisel has proved difficult to closely parallel, although the form and style seem consistent with Bronze Age types. The Sparkford Hill Hoard, Somerset (Smith Ed., 1959, Inventaria Archaeologia; An Illustrated Card-Inventory of Important Associated Finds in Archaeology; Great Britain 7th Set: GB. 42-47) contained a larger chisel of similar form and dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age. A similar chisel found at Monkton, Pembrokeshire (Savory 1980, pp. 117, No 265) was dated through associated artefacts to the 11th or 10th century BC. Both of these parallels have a less flared blade compared to this example.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20062.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
