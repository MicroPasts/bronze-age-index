The surviving fragment comprises of the point of the spear head, between the point and the internal socket end. The fragment is sub-triangular in plan, expanding from the point into an old break. The spearhead is cast with a central longitudinal midrib, from which the wings project tapering into the edge. The mid-rib and socket are both rounded in cross section. The fragment is bent, curving to one side in profile.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 35.65mm; width 16.80mm; thickness 9.10mm; weight 11.15g.\n\n\n\nWithout the socket, the fragment cannot be more precisely dated. However the roundness of the central mid-rib may suggest a Middle Bronze Age date, cf.
