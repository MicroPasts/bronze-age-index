The blade of the palstave is broadly sub-triangular in plan with relatively straight (but with slightly expanded) sides and a expanding convex cutting edge (fantailed). In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Beneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave is a shield shaped depression. The rear part of the axe, from the stop ridge to the butt, is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge, it has a central rectangular shaped septum.\n\n\n\nLength: 168 mm\n\nWidth: 73 mm\n\nThickness: 31 mm\n\nWeight: 485 g\n\n\n\nThis form and style of palstave fits can be classified as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1500-1300 BC specifically within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.","fourFigureLat":"52.77368692","fourFigureLon":"-1.03793326","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"\nRecord created by images and information kindly provided by the finder\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Megan Gard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Megan Gard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hoby with Rotherby","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Melton","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/7182E5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"168"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
