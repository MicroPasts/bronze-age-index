The axe head is complete, with an overall length of 22.1mm and a weight of 4.4g. The butt is sub-rectangular and convex (8.2mm x 4.9mm), at the centre is a small oval depression (3.9mm long, 1.9mm wide, 0.9mm deep) representing the socket of a socketed axe, similar to Late Bronze Age forms. The unlooped side is slightly concave and is rounded across its thickness. The loped side is more concave. The loop begins 4.6mm from the butt and end 9.4mm from the butt. The loop has a circular internal perforation with a diameter of 2.0mm. The loop is of D-shaped section with a thickness of 1.8mm and a width of 3.2mm. It was possible that the axe was suspended from the loop as a pendant or similar. The blade edge is straight with rounded blade tips. The axe has a wedge-shaped profile and both faces are plain. The surface is well preserved with pale to dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.527448","fourFigureLon":"-1.669852","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Metallurgical analysis was attempted using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). This object has a fine, even patination, and it was not possible to analyse the underlying metal. The results show a leaded bronze, which would be consistent with LBA compositions, but a Roman date could not be rules out by the analysis. Miniature axes have a largely south west England distribution with a concentration in Wiltshire; Robinson catalogues 36 examples from the county (ibid). The axes are problematic to date because of a lack of reliable contextual information. The creation of a cast socket would seem to suggest a Late Bronze Age date and miniature axes have been found near midden sites such as Whitchurch in Warwickshire (Waddington pers comm.) and from Potterne in Wiltshire. Robinson (1988, p 61) speculates that Late Bronze Age axes may have been venerated and copied as amulates into the Roman period.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 1988","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishopstone","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.75.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"22.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
