The inner surface of the hole is rough and there is a visible casting flaw within the interior. The solidity of the bead and the rough cylindrical interior of the central hole suggests that the method of manufacture was casting rather than construction from sheet metal.\n\n\n\nDiameter: 8.4mm, thickness / height: 6.3mm, weight: 1.88g.","fourFigureLat":"51.23799766","fourFigureLon":"-1.28516994","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"This bead is likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC) based on comparanda from the database (NMS-AEC678 (2013T20), HAMP-72E451 (2011T526), PAS-65902F (2015T175) and GLO-46CA05 (2014T358)) and various other excavated examples from stratified contexts (as quoted in these PAS records). Such Middle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al.) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Roberts, 2007).\n\n\n\nConclusion: The object contains more than 10% precious metal and is of prehistoric date. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 and the 2002 Treasure Designation Order, in terms of both age and precious metal content.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"January 27, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"8.4","edge":null,"thickness":"6.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Overton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR165AC6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
