The axe is complete at 89.3mm long, 51.8mm wide and 12.7mm thick. It has a rounded cutting edge and straight sides that taper to the butt which is also rounded. There are two chips in the butt. The centre of the sides are slightly thickened. This is believed to be a precaution to try and prevent the wooden handle splitting when hafted. The main faces of the axe are slightly roughened, with some raised areas. This is probably a result of slight corrosion, though the axe is in generally good condition. The axe has a mid-green patina which is deeper in colour on the cutting edge and the butt. This style of axe, a flat axe, was the first sort of metal axe to be produced, and it’s similarities with stone axes are obvious. Similar examples can be seen in “Guide to the Collection Illustrating the Prehistory of Wales” by W F Grimes (1939).","fourFigureLat":"54.024679","fourFigureLon":"-1.253538","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"September 23, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nun Monkton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 337 axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"98.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
