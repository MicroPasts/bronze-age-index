The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade.  A single incomplete rivet hole/notch to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, one of the notches still retains its rivet; the rivet is 15mm long with a 7mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The centre of the butt has a low central rib on both sides that extends up to the base of the blade. The blade is straight and only tapers to a point in the last 25mm of its length; the overall length of the blade alone is approximately 166mm long, 20mm wide and 3.8mm thick.  The end of the blade has been snapped off, the angle of the break shows that the final 65mm of the blade was bent back on itself to about a 140 degree angle before the metal gave way and snapped. This is not post-depositional damage but a premeditated act prior to loss/burial.\n\n\n\nThe overall length including broken tip is 234mm\n\n\n\n\n\nThis fits within Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV Type, see WILT-AD8D05 for a similar example and further discussion.","fourFigureLat":"51.69795012","fourFigureLon":"-1.56733069","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"August 31, 2008","datefound2":"March 01, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bampton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO036A39.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"234"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
