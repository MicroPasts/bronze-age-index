The object is plano-convex, solid and an oval shape in plan.  There is an hour-glass shaped hole through the centre of the object where it is currently broken.  The convex surface is covered in tight rows of linear marks which could be the result of filing, or perhaps the mirror image of the mould it was cast in.  The object looks like a miniature verson of a polished stone prehistoric macehead.","fourFigureLat":"53.074433","fourFigureLon":"-0.553581","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"1499","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wellingore","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN3533.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
