The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a narrow butt evenly expanding sides that extend to a splayed crescent shaped blade. In cross section the axe is rectangular shaped with both sides being relatively flat and sides having a rounded curve. The butt of the axe has a horizontal top edge and the corners are rounded. The sides of the axe gently expand evenly in width to a point just above the cutting edge where they become distinctly out-turned / splayed. The axe is a mid-green colour with a large areas of highly polished surface patina. This patina has been broken in several places and where this has occurred laminating corrosion has removed considerable surfaces. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. Although there has been some surface loss there is no evidence of applied incised or hammered decoration.\n\nLength: 145 mm\n\nWidth: 76 mm\n\nThickness: 6mm \n\nWeight: 343 g\n\n\n\nNeedham flat axe class 3, either C or D. \n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Ed Caswell and Peter Reavill for help in narrowing the axehead to a type.","fourFigureLat":"52.90299142","fourFigureLon":"-1.67436871","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1900","notes":"\nImages and information kindly provided by the finder.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Megan Gard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Megan Gard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barton Blount","county":"Derbyshire","district":"South Derbyshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/6A8512.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"145"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
