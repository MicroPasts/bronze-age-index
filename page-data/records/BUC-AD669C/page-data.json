The ring is circular in shape and in cross section, with two flat terminals. Between the terminals is copper alloy corrosion, suggesting that the main body of the ring is copper alloy plated with gold. One of the terminals is damaged, with the surface cracked and partly missing showing the inside of the ring.  The surface of the ring is a light yellow gold colour, with slightly darker stripes running across the ring in bands. \n\n\n\nDimensions:\n\nLength: 15.8 mm\n\nWidth: 15.2 mm\n\nThickness: 5.2 mm\n\nWeight: 3.75 g\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Penannular rings are not uncommon finds reported Treasure and recorded on the PAS database. Other examples featuring similar ‘tiger striped’ decoration include: 2019 T1091 (HAMP-BE4072) and 2020 T780 (NLM-59A99B). The report and PAS database record for 2020 T77 (OXON-FFD016) notes that ring “appears similar to a class of artefact which have in the past been given various terms such as 'hair-rings' (Eogan 1997) and other monikers such as ‘Ring Money’ (Green 1988) which are now no longer supported (Taylor 1980, 65; Varndell 2001). Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003 opinion cited, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange”.","fourFigureLat":"51.31494295","fourFigureLon":"1.14119628","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\n\nAuthor: Arwen Wood, Finds Liaison Officer for Buckinghamshire\n\nContribution by: Ian Richardson, Senior Treasure Registrar, British Museum             \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\nEogan, G. 1997. ‘Hair-rings’ and European Late Bronze Age society.
