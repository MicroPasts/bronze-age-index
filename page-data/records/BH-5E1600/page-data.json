The surviving axe consists of the blade and part of the broken hollow body. The body of the axe is sub-trapezoidal in plan and rectangular in cross-section. A short section of the offset longitudinal casting seam is visible on each side. The body extends while gradually thinning to a flared convex cutting edge with broken and worn corners that expand slightly wider than the body. The blade edge is worn and damaged, while the breaks on the body are also old and worn. The exterior surfaces of the axehead have a mid-green patina with patches of brown deposition residue. There are several areas of lamination on the surfaces of the body and blade that have a light-green patina as well, as do the breaks on the body and the interior surfaces of the hollow.\n\n\n\nThe axe head measures a maximum of 29.9mm in length, 43.4mm in maximum width, 13.3mm in body thickness at the break and 4.2mm thick at the blade edge. The entire object weighs 49.18 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.8387224","fourFigureLon":"-0.25966163","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"October 20, 2018","datefound2":"October 20, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ayot St. Lawrence","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"Welwyn Hatfield","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH5E1600.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"29.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
