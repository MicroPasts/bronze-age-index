The fragment includes part of the septum and the flanges and tapers outwards from the narrow butt-end towards the broken edge. It is a light green colour with a corrosion pitted surface. Dimensions: length 59.95mm width 24.70mm; weight 61g\n\n\n\nThe find was first identified as a palstave however the height of the flanges and their length combined with the lack of a stopridge make this unlikely. On the available evidence this is closer in form to a long flanged axehead see for example LVPL-558FA2 on the database. The long flanges will classify this either as a long flanged axehead or a developed flat axe. The flanges appear to be cast favouring the former type, although the diverging sides may indicate the latter. In either circumstance this form dates to the Early Bronze Age c. 1750-1500 cal BC (Following Roberts et al 2013). This type may further be refined if consulting Needham's (2018) schema or that of Schmidt and Burgess (1981)","fourFigureLat":"51.54462239","fourFigureLon":"-1.45342267","fromdate":"-1750","todate":"-1500","notes":"Found during the Weekend Wanderers King Alfred the Great Rally 26-28 Aug","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David Williams","datefound1":"August 25, 2006","datefound2":"August 25, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Paula Levick","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Letcombe Regis","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/plevick/y62.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Berkshire","length":"59.96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
