The hilt plate is roughly rectangular and is narrowed before the worn and damaged fantail-like terminal.  At the other end it survives up to the third rivet aperture.  The break runs through the aperture and all surfaces of the break are well patinated and worn.  There are two longitudinal channels running along either face, giving the object an undulating cross-section.  The bronze is well worn and now a dusty green colour with extensive patches of brown patina.  This brown patina almost covers one side whereas on the other side it only covers approximately 50%.\n\nSimilar finds from Lincolnshire come from Tattershall, Lincoln and Billinghay (Davey, 1973, fig 43).","fourFigureLat":"52.902386","fourFigureLon":"-0.455239","fromdate":"-850","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walcot Near Folkingham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN-E19555.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
