It is triangular in shape. Triangular blades extend from either side, with a central rib on both sides.\n\n\n\nIt measures 22.4 mm in length, 11.4 mm wide (base), 5.3 mm wide (tip) and 6.3 mm thick at the break, and 3.0 mm thick at the tip. It weighs 2.8 g.\n\n\n\nThe probable spear head is a dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.","fourFigureLat":"52.04419594","fourFigureLon":"-0.8932804","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"April 14, 2017","datefound2":"April 14, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Deanshanger","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/wmid560f7f.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"22.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
