This is a copper alloy core that has been gold coated, such as NMS-183C7E. One of the terminals has been damaged and the copper alloy core exposed. The ring is circular in section with flat opposed terminals. The ring has a tiger striped colouration around the inside of the internal diameter. This is a patination found on other examples such as HAMP-C18814 and SUSS-EA6735.\n\n\n\nThese rings are often erroneously referred to as 'ring money' though there is no evidence to suggest that they were used as currency. They are predominantly believed to have been used for personal adornment, such as earrings or nose rings, they have even been suggested as hair ornaments. A complete example can be found in HAMP-0F9AF6 and there are numerous others recorded on the database, some found as part of hoards.\n\n\n\nWork on these rings can be found in (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008), See NMGW-04216C for full references.\n\n\n\n.","fourFigureLat":"50.93967503","fourFigureLon":"-1.06203026","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Edwin Wood","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20.5","edge":null,"thickness":"7.04","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hambledon","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/PenRingSUSS5EF5C1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
