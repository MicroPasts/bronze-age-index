This survival, even to a small extent, is probably due to its deposition in a semi-waterlogged context. The butt is broad and the septum is relatively thick at 9.7mm. On either side of the septem the outer edges gradually rise upwards, creating a symmetrical curve on each side when viewed from above. The single loop, which is flattened in cross section. extends for 21mm on the upper surface, and there is a suggestion of a decorative cast line directly above this, extending along the side of the septum on this surface only. These broad edges narrow to the stop, which is rectilinear and measures 36.4 x 24.9mm. The blade extends in a linear fashion, only very gradually widening to the flared cutting edge. There is a central midrib on both sides of the blade, and it is further decorated with three deliberately incised grooves on the lower surface. The flared cutting edge remains relatively sharp, and measures 45.3mm in width and is 1.7mm thick at the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nMatt Knight has commented on a similar example: \"Palstaves of this type are typically found across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, as well as further eastwards in Dorset and Wiltshire. Pearce (1983: 450 no. 279b, see also Plate 34) presents a very similar example from North Bovey. DEV-01DDC5 is a not dissimilar example from further east in the county.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 107.5mm length, 24.9mm width, 36.4mm thick and weight over 200g.","fourFigureLat":"50.36749146","fourFigureLon":"-4.06832477","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"36.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Plymstock Dunstone","county":"City of Plymouth","district":"City of Plymouth","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEVAEDD76.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"107.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
