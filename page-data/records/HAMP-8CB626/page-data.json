The object has a broadly rectangular terminal (31.0 x 15.25mm), possibly broken, with an uneven surface.  In one plane this tapers, and in the other flares gradually, to a broadly square end (28.2 x 25.2mm) with a central oval hole (12.05 x 9.2 x c. 17mm deep). On one side of the square end, aligned with the narrow end of the terminal is a small broadly circular protrusion.  It is suggested that this is a crude socketed hammer, broken at the socketed end (hence the abnormally shallow and narrow socket), with the stub of an attachment loop surviving. The object is heavily corroded and pitted with a dark green patina where it survives; the metal underneath is a lighter green colour.","fourFigureLat":"51.051179","fourFigureLon":"-1.801645","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"April 06, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Salisbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-8CB626hammer.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"43.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
