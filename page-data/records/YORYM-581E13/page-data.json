The object is broadly square in profile with two integrally cast recessed lines running longitudinally, no other decoration is visible.\n\n\nThe metal is a light green in colour.","fourFigureLat":"53.84719","fourFigureLon":"-0.527076","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"410","notes":"The initial records and photographic images were taken at Bishop Burton 2011 Rally. We understand that the images fall below our usual standards, this however is due to the difficult conditions (predominantly the lack of ideal lighting conditions) under which they were taken. The recorder has done what is possible to raise the quality of the images before attaching them to the records.\n\nAs these finds were recorded at the Bishop Burton 2011 Rally, the individual recording them onto the PAS Database has not seen them and was not the primary identifier. Therefore for more in-depth, secondary identification, only the paper records written at the Rally and the photographic images were available to assist.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Martin Foreman","datefound1":"September 23, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Ellie Cox","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.86","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishop Burton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ellie/BB 772.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"17.44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
