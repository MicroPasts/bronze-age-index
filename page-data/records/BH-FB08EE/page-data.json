The spear has a leaf-shaped blade that tapers towards the tip. The blade wings are bevelled, both of which are worn and damaged in places. The blade has a circular cross-section central rib running from tip to base, and wings that gradually expand before tapering inwards to connect to the socketed shaft. The shaft, which is circular in section, increases in diameter towards the open-ended terminal and has a loop halfway along each side made of a flat rhomboidal-shaped plate that sits in line with the cutting edges of the blade. The spear measures 116mm in length. The widest section of the blade is 25mm in width and 3mm thick, while the internal diameter of the socket is a maximum of 17mm. The spear weighs 68.76 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.11039628","fourFigureLon":"-0.39513836","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Harvey Cross","datefound1":"January 01, 1982","datefound2":"December 31, 1982","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cople","county":"Bedford","district":"Bedford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BHFB08EE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"116"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
