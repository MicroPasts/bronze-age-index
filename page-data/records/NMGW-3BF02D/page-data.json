Palstave butt end fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 24.7mm; butt width 23.5mm; max. thickness at break 11.2mm; surviving weight 25.9g.\n\n\n\nSmall butt end fragment of palstave. In side view, the flanges reach the septum approximately 14mm below the butt end and there is some concavity and change of angle in the upper profile. The butt end is wide and angular, with a slightly convex curved top. On both faces of the upper septum, repeated scratch marks are evident and these look relatively recent. The break appears to have occurred in antiquity. The fragment has a dark grey green patination.\n\n\n\n2. Palstave butt end fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 29.7mm; butt width 21.3mm; max. thickness at break 11.8mm; surviving weight 26.8g.\n\n\n\nSmall butt end fragment of a palstave. In side view, the flanges reach the septum approximately 17mm below the butt end and there is little concavity and change of angle in the upper profile. The butt end tapers noticeably in plan view to approximately 21.3mm. There is some damage to the end profile, although it would appear that the butt end had a slightly convex curved top profile. The break appears to have been made in antiquity. The fragment has a light grey green patination with some surface pitting and corrosion evident.\n\n\n\n3. Small blade fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 32.7mm; width at breaks 16.5mm & 17.5mm; max. thickness 4.8mm; surviving weight 10.4g.\n\n\n\nSmall and narrow blade fragment, whose blade has a rounded centre-section. The blade sides are slightly concave. In side view, there is slight bending of the blade near the upper blade break, suggesting forcible breaking of the blade. Some areas of original blade face surfaces have been eroded, while blade edges have pale green powdering. The break surfaces are worn, suggesting the blade was broken in antiquity. The blade fragment has a green-brown patina.\n\n\n\n4. Spearhead lower blade fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 33.0mm; max. surviving width at lower break 26.2mm; maximum thickness at lower break 10.9mm; aperture diameter at lower break 7.5mm; surviving weight 20.7g.\n\n\n\nSmall lower blade fragment of a spearhead with a rounded midrib. The wide midrib tapers significantly from approximately13mm at lower break to approximately 10mm at the upper break, indicating it is a lower blade fragment. In side-section, there is an oval shaped hollow up the central midrib of the blade (7.6mm wide at lower break and 5.2mm wide at upper break). The blade margins and edges have been eroded away and are absent. In side view, there is pronounced bending towards the upper break, suggesting forcible breaking of the spearhead. Near the lower break on one face, there is a flattening and slight dent, suggesting breakage through impact with an implement of unknown form. The break surfaces are worn, suggesting the spearhead was broken in antiquity. One face is differentially eroded and pitted, with a pale green patina, while the reverse has greater survival of original surfaces and has a dark grey-green patina. The eroded edges are pale green and powdery.\n\n\n\n5. Flat plate fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: Maximum length 23.7mm; maximum width 21.4mm; thickness 4.0mm; surviving weight 8.8g.\n\n\n\nSmall flat plate fragment. One edge has a bevelled margin, as if it was deliberately shaped and was an upper surface. Very slight, almost imperceptible concavity of the reverse side suggests it may have been an interior surface. On both surfaces, there are slight linear and irregular shaped surface blemishes, showing as slight negative depressions. These are probable irregularities created during the casting process. The break edges of the plate are eroded, suggesting breakage in antiquity. The plate fragment has a dark grey-green patina.\n\n\n\nDiscussion (by Adam Gwilt)\n\n\n\nThe two palstave butt fragments (Nos. 1 & 2) may be identified with confidence as either belonging to Transitional palstaves of Middle Bronze Age date or Late palstaves of Late Bronze Age date. The chief discriminating feature between the butts of these two forms is in the shape of the side flange profile. With Transitional palstaves, flanges are highest at the stop and they typically extend in a straight line from stop to butt, to give an elongated lozenge form (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 145-6). Late palstaves, by contrast have short flanges, curving and descending to meet the septum well below the butt (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 158). The distinction however is one of degree: some later Transitional palstaves do have flanges reaching the septum well below the butt, with some concave curvature in the slope evident (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 146). On these two small butt fragments, a clear typological distinction is difficult to make, since both have side flanges which meet the septum some distance below the butt and hinting at a concavity of slope, rather than in a straight line. The wide and square end of one palstave fragment (No. 1) is a tendency more typically viewed on Late palstaves (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, Plates 66-7), however some Transitional palstaves also exhibit similar characteristics. On this morphological evidence, it is difficult to differentiate between later examples of Transitional palstaves or Late palstaves.\n\n\n\nThe presence of small but deliberately added quantities of lead (1-5%) to the composition of these palstaves is instructive. Metallurgical analysis of Transitional palstaves from Wales and The Marches has indicated a general pattern of unleaded bronze compositions with trace presences (less than 0.1%) of lead in some (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 451-86). By contrast, analyses of Late palstaves from Wales and The Marches show leaded bronze compositions with a range of 1.0-17.5% lead added, and frequently in the range of 1-6% (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 496-545). On this metallurgical evidence, the two palstave butt fragments from Penllyn are consistent with Late palstave compositions and, on a balance of probability, are probably fragments of Late palstaves rather than Transitional palstaves.\n\n\n\nLate palstaves were made during the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age and spanning from 1150 to 800 BC (e.g. Savory 1980, 47; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 162-3; Northover unpublished a, 212, 270, 274-7; Davies & Lynch 2000, 180-7 & Fig. 4.15). In Wales, Late palstaves were included within the Guilsfield hoard of late Wilburton date (e.g. Savory 1980, 117-8, Fig. 32) and they have commonly been found in hoards of Ewart Park date (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 275, 281 & 285 & Figs. 31, 42 & 44; Northover unpublished a, Hoards 3, 28, 63, 68, 74, 108, 114, 130, 134).\n\nThe small blade fragment (No. 3), though not definitively diagnostic has two diagnostic features, a narrow blade form combined with a blade with rounded centre section. This is sufficient to exclude the possibility of it belonging to a dagger or knife of Early Bronze Age date (e.g. Gerloff 1975), or a sword blade of Middle to Late Bronze Age date (e.g. Colquhoun & Burgess 1988). This leaves two main possibilities: either a blade fragment from a socketed knife of Late Bronze Age date or a rapier blade fragment of Middle Bronze Age date, possibly from a reworked blade.\n\n\n\nThe unusually narrow blade width is not frequently paralleled amongst the known examples of socketed knives from Wales (Gwilt et al 2005, 54). However a similar blade width and profile with a rounded centre section is seen on a single example of socketed knife from Minera, Wrexham (Savory 1980, 54, 111, Cat. 224a & Fig. 26; Gwilt et al 2005, 54). This has a blade width of approximately 16.5mm, in comparison with the range of 16.5-17.5mm width on this blade fragment. The Minera knife is of Type Thorndon, a type dating to the Late Bronze Age, with a number of associations in the Ewart Park phase dating to between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Hodges 1956; Coles 1959-60, 46; Needham 1993,44-6 & Fig. 33.10; Gwilt et al 2005, 37 & 54-55, Appendix 2).\n\n\n\nAlternatively, this combination of blade features most closely matches one of the later types of Group IV rapiers, such as Type Appleby or Type Stuntney (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 74-84). These belong to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age but continued into the Wilburton phase at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the centuries from 1300 to 1000 BC (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 106-109). Group IV rapiers are the most common of the British rapier forms and were commonly reworked later during their use lives, often being found as broken and undiagnostic blade fragments. It is possible therefore, that a rapier made towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age could remain in use and circulation into the Late Bronze Age, only being deposited in a hoard then.\n\n\n\nThe presence of small but deliberately added quantities of lead (1-5%) to the composition of this blade fragment is however instructive in determining between these two possibilities. Metallurgical analysis of nine examples of Middle Bronze Age Group IV rapiers from Wales and The Marches has so far indicated a pattern of unleaded bronze compositions with trace lead presences (less than 0.5%) in some (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 997-1007). Similar analyses of eleven examples of Late Bronze Age socketed knives and reworked knife blades from Wales and The Marches typically show leaded bronze compositions with a range of 2.0-9.5% lead added (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1353-68). This would be in a range consistent with the composition of the blade fragment, suggesting it is probably from a socketed knife of Late Bronze Age date, and not a blade fragment from a Group IV rapier.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead fragment (No. 4) is part of a lower blade, as evidenced by the size of the internal aperture (7.5mm) along the central rib of the spear at the lower break. No diagnostic features are preserved on this spearhead fragment, to link it to type and secure date. A spearhead with a prominent rounded mid-rib and circular to oval shaped internal aperture is consistent with deriving from a larger side-looped spearhead or basal looped spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1150BC), or a pegged spearhead of Late Bronze Age date (1150-800 BC) (e.g. Ehrenberg 1977; Davis 2006; 2012). The spearhead contains a small percentage of deliberately added lead (1-5%), which may be compared with the compositions of other spearheads of side-looped, basal-looped and pegged spearheads from Wales and The Marches. The existing compositional data indicates side-looped and basal-looped spearheads of Middle Bronze Age date contain up to 1.5% lead, though most commonly less than 1% lead (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1111-1161). The plain pegged and lozenge sectioned spearheads of the Late Bronze Age contain a range of 0.6-18.6% lead composition, most commonly in the 1.5-10% range (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1164-1267). On the basis of metallurgical composition, this spearhead fragment has a lead content most likely to derive from a Late Bronze Age pegged spearhead form.\n\n\n\nThe bronze plate fragment (No. 5) proves problematic to identify to a known class of finished artefact of Bronze Age date. While its bevelled edge, slightly convex upper surface and slight concavity of the underside suggest the possibility of once belonging to a cast artefact, it exhibits no diagnostic features. However its bronze composition, with a small added component of lead (1-5%) is the same as the composition of the other artefacts and suggests that this piece is probably of contemporary age. Its similar patination, thickness and cast technology all add to this suggestion. Ingot and plate scrap fragments become recognised raw material components of hoards during the Late Bronze Age. The Guilsfield, Powys hoard contains many fragments cast plate fragments of leaded bronze (Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268, Fig. 38). It is possible therefore, that this plate fragment represents a bi-product of the bronze casting process; a piece of bronze available for recycling and casting into a finished object.\n\n\n\nThe dating of all the artefact types present in this scatter suggests a probable date during the Wilburton or Ewart Park periods of the Late Bronze Age, spanning from 1150 to 800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Typological attribution has been considerably aided by semi-quantitative analyses of the metallurgical compositions of these artefacts and their comparison with existing quantitative data from known Bronze Age metalwork from Wales and The Marches. Small, but deliberate additions of lead to the bronze in all cases, have tipped identifications of these highly fragmentary pieces in favour of known Late Bronze Age possible types and away from Middle Bronze Age possibilities. These similar compositional signatures are consistent with the artefacts being of contemporary date when deposited.\n\n\n\nGiven their tight spatial clustering within a 50m area of a field and the presence of multiple artefacts of contemporary date, it is felt that, on a balance of probability and given the evidence available, these artefacts were once probably buried together as a hoard group, and therefore may be regarded as treasure. It is probable that the artefacts had been disturbed in recent times on this shallow soil onto bedrock, possibly through spike harrowing or ploughing of marginal land during the Second World War. The finder reported also discovering modern agricultural harrow spikes of iron within the field where the artefacts were reported. It is possible that further artefacts or artefact fragments remain to be discovered in this field and were also once part of the same hoard. The association of Late palstaves, knife and spearhead in this hoard group and the highly fragmented character of artefacts reported, make its composition and character unusual for south east Wales. Here, most Ewart Park hoards are dominated by socketed axes of the South Wales type (e.g. McNeil 1973; Moore 1978; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), while complete or near complete artefacts are usually present in addition to fragmentary objects.","fourFigureLat":"51.50123654","fourFigureLon":"-3.4276731","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"Metallurgical Analysis (by Mary Davis)\n\n\n\nQualitative surface analysis of the objects within the hoard was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6µA for 100 live seconds. Surface analysis is susceptible to distortions due to the asymmetry of whole objects (rather that flat polished samples). Surface corrosion can lead to the surface enrichment (e.g. tin) and depletion (e.g. zinc) of elements; lead is often unevenly distributed within copper alloys. These factors can affect the quantities of copper and tin, lead and zinc analysed on the surface of an object.\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nAll objects are of bronze with relatively small quantities of lead deliberately added (above 1%, and probably less than 5% lead). The quantities of major elements vary, and the trace elements show different patterns of presence/absence.\n\n\n\nThe consistent and deliberate addition of small quantities of lead to these tin bronze objects provides evidence in support of their contemporary date. Specifically, it helps to demonstrate that the flat plate fragment (No. 5 above) has a composition consistent with the other artefacts in the group. The deliberate addition of lead to bronze within the casting process is first witnessed during the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Northover 1980; 1982; unpublished a, 205). For these fragmentary artefacts, which are not entirely diagnostic to type and date, this leaded bronze metallurgical composition provides evidence in support of a Late Bronze Age date, rather than a Middle Bronze Age date.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBurgess, C.B. & Gerloff, S. 1981.
