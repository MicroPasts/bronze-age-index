The wheel is circular in plan with a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate before joining the outer rim. The rim of the wheel and the spokes are rectangular in cross section. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle which appears to have been drilled. The upper corners of the model are slightly rounded while the reverse are angular.\n\n\n\nOn the record for HESH-C53CF4, which is very similar to this example, Peter Reavill writes:\n\n\n\n\"This form of artefact is relatively rare and the PAS has only recorded one other example from Thimbleby, Lincolnshire (DENO-0BBA52). Images of this artefact were sent to Dr Adam Gwilt at NMGW, Cardiff. Dr Gwilt suggested that similar comparable artefacts had been recorded in the late Bronze Age / Early Iron Age assemblage from the votive site at Flag Fen, Peterborough, amongst the Iron Age Salisbury hoard, and also the Hounslow Hoard. \"\n\n\n\nSee KENT-9348EE, KENT-70F063, PUBLIC-7D1FFC and HESH-C53CF4 for similar examples.","fourFigureLat":"51.842048","fourFigureLon":"-1.63852732","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"May 31, 2017","datefound2":"January 07, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Milton-under-Wychwood","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLOE82DE1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"18"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
