The tip of the blade has an unusual 'hook' like form. A similar tip can be seen in - The Bronze Age in Ireland (Coffey 1913) has a palstave at Chapter III plate I. where a very similar 'hooked tip' to a palstave. At Fig 20, there is a similar tip to a Winged Celt. Therefore, this is suggestive of the object being from the Middle to Late Bronze Age c. 1400-800 BC. The tip has a smooth mid-green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.58051811","fourFigureLon":"-1.43856061","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"September 06, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wantage","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BERK913FEA.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"9.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
