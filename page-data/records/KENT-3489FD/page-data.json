Both edges where remaining has been heavily abraded along their edge, leaving them uneven. There is a pronounced conical mid rib that is hollow from the socket to the majority of the way through the blade. Where it has broken giving a cross-section of the rib shows it to be solid nearish to the point. There is a substantial mould line along the side of the shaft. There is only one loop on the spearhead, abutting the blade. There does not appear to be any breaks, swelling or any other suggestion that another loop existed on the other side. It is a small hemispherical loop\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a dark brown colour with frequent patchesof rough light green corrosion product likely bronze disease.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 124.11m long, 35.2mm wide, 20.26mm thick (blade is 3.32mm thick) and 104.89g in weight.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nThis spearhead is odd for a number of reasons. Firstly single looped spearheads are very rare (with only one example to this date on the database: DUR-F54FE1), Those with abutting loops to the blade are similarly uncommon. Secondly these types are not known from the south-east and are more commonly found in Northern Britain and Ireland. Thirdly this exmaple from Kent while sharing identifying features does not fit all the attributes of the aformentioned northern and Irish groups and is, at present, unique in the archaeological record.","fourFigureLat":"51.27590126","fourFigureLon":"1.25325714","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-1125","notes":"\nInformation on this spearhead, its identification and confirmation of this spearhead's unique status thanks to Dr. Richard Davis, University of Nottingham and Author of 'The Early and Middle Bronze Age spearheads of Britain'.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.26","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ash","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT3489FD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"124.11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
