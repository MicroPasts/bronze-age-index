There is a single very shallow mouth-moulding, with unfinished 'lip'.  The loop is a half oval in shape and starts from approximately 9.8mm down the casting seam on one side of the body. In cross-section the body is sub-rectangular, the aperture being almost square, narrowing downwards to a blunt narrow oval. In plan the body tapers very slightly for about two-thirds of its length then expanding to the cutting edge which forms a very shallow crescent. In profile the axehead forms a long narrow triangle, with a casting seam visible on both sides. On the side with the loop this ridge runs in an uninterrupted seam through the outside of the loop, and is poorly finished, on the other side the seam is slightly off centre and is also poorly finished.  At the bottom of the loop at the junction with the body, and just below the loop on the side of the axehead are two patches of woven material which appear to have a herringbone pattern.","fourFigureLat":"50.661382","fourFigureLon":"-1.124177","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Part of a hoard of eleven implements.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"","datefound1":"February 01, 2002","datefound2":"March 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"36.05","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Sandown","county":"Isle of Wight","district":"Isle of Wight","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sworrell/IOW2002-26 Kirkton Hoard.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Finder","length":"99.44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
