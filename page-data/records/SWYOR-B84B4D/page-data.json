It is probably from Needham Period 4-5; the Arreton, Acton or Taunton metalwork assemblage. There is a lozenge shaped flange on each side of the butt end. The blade tip is crescent shaped but no bevels are visible. The sides of the blade flare towards the cutting edge, and are curved. There is no stop ridge for the handle to butt against, but the blade is thicker than the septum. There is a raised curved line at the haft end of the blade - a shield pattern - on both faces, and within the shield is a central arris running along the axe towards the septum. The surfaces inside the flanges are smooth and deep green, but the more exposed surfaces are extensively pitted. The butt end is damaged, so it is not clear if it was notched (concave) or not. The object weighs 446g, has a length of 151.7mm, a width of 29.7mm and has a thickness of 29mm.  \n\n\n\nCompare DOR-5D7F46 which cites Peter Reavill who reports that Burgess and Schmidt note the affinities of the shield shaped pattern to that seen on Palstaves of the same period (pp 84-89)\" suggesting a date of about 1600-1400 BC (Needham Periods 4-5 and Burgess Metal Working Stage VII and VIII).
