Some surface patches are missing on both sides and the blade edges are a little ragged. The razor is oval with a short narrow tang. The tang tapers and gets wider towards the blade. The edge of the tang continues into the body of the razor and the two sides form the inner edges of the blade itself.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments:\n\n\n\nThis is a Piggott (1946) Class I double-edged razor - some of these are decorated along the mid rib and many are pierced through the tang. The date is later EBA - early MBA and they are often associated with burials. This example is similar to Piggott's cat. no.34 which is from Winterslow, Wilts (and associated with cinerary urn and amber buttons / hair ornaments - now in Ashmoleon Museum). I would expect it to date in the region of c1800 BC - c1400 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.70694101","fourFigureLon":"-1.56724498","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-1400","notes":"\nTeh razor as kindly donated by the finder to the Oxfordshire Museums Service\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Margaret Broomfield","datefound1":"June 20, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bampton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/B15852.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"90.07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
