The entire axehead is 154.21mm in length, with a maximum width across the flanges measuring 42.81mm. The blade expands out from the centre of the head. The edge is cresent shaped, with a breadth of 47.45mm from tip to tip. The axe is thickest at the base of the blade, 13.99 and 1.38mm thick at the worn and incmomplete edge of the butt. The flanges expand from the top and bottom of the septum in a sub-triangular fashion, peaking nearer to the blade than the butt. In depth, each flange measures 18.38 from the septum to outer edge. There is a thickening separating the septum from the blade, but no truly formed stop. The butt is slightly rounded. The object has an even grey-green-brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"55.212986","fourFigureLon":"-1.750093","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"June 30, 2010","datefound2":"July 30, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"22.45","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.99","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tritlington and West Chevington","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/IMG_4844.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"154.21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
