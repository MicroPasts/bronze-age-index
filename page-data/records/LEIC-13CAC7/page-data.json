The spearhead is almost complete, it is missing fragments of the socketed base.&nbsp;The spear has a lozenge shaped cross- section with a high mid-rib which tapers towards from the tip toward the break. The socket is conical. The socket is filled with soil and a depth cannot be determined.&nbsp;The blade extends at the head of the socket and is largely complete, little of the edge is worn away. There is no evidence of any side loops, though these may be worn away and corroded. No peg holes appear to be present but the object is broken where these are likely to have been.&nbsp;The spearhead is a mid green to brown colour. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has&nbsp;resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.\nLength: 95.5 mm\nWidth: 20.8 mm\nThickness: 4.7 mm\nWeight: 48.58 g\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV; which she dates to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham&#39;s Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150&nbsp;BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of the Nantcwnlle spear was analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200&nbsp;BC. Davis (2012) classified this form of spearhead as his Group 6 Developed side looped - Type 6 B (flame - flat blade - lozenge plates)","fourFigureLat":"53.04642907","fourFigureLon":"-1.55395771","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Megan Gard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shottle and Postern","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Amber Valley","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/13CAC7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"95.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
