The fragment is an elongated triangular socket with traces of a blade either side. The edges of the blade are heavily abraded. The tip and lower edges are both broken, these breaks are not too recent. The lower break has a circular sectioned socket. The surface of the spearhead is pitted and has an incomplete heavy dark grey patina. The spear measures 35.95mm long, 11.09mm wide and 8.18mm thick. It weighs 5.4g. The heavy patina, and shape in section suggest this is a Bronze Age spearhead. However, as the majority of the object is missing, which has the diagnostic features such as side-loops missing the dating cannot be narrowed down further.","fourFigureLat":"52.318927","fourFigureLon":"-1.796034","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2009","datefound2":"November 23, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tanworth-in-Arden","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-3143C0.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"35.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
