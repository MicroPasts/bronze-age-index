This expands over c.11mm to 5.7x5.1mm, with the two opposing wider sides being completely flat while one of the other two sides haa a shallow longitudinal indentation and the other a slightly raised area (perhaps a worn casting flash). Just beyond the awl becomes circular in cross-section, measuring 5.9mm in diameter. This end of the awl then narrows over c.26mm to a rounded tip, 1.5mm in diameter.\n\nThe object has a smooth greyish-green patina.
