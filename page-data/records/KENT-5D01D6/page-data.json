No edge remains intact so over all shape is based on known more complete examples. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips likely flared slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible . The axehead is patinated dark green and mottled light brown to green across the abraded edges.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length: 23.67mm, Width: 24mm, Thickness: 10.42mm, Weight: 19.37g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Although, due to completeness it is not certain but this axehead probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).","fourFigureLat":"51.19510472","fourFigureLon":"1.24755845","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.42","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eythorne","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT5D01D6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"23.67"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
