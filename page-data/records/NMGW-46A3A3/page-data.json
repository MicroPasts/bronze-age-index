The whole length of the hammer is represented on the side (with a length of 52.2mm). The mouth suggests a square or rectangular body section (with external surviving dimensions of 22.3mm x 16.3mm and with an internal width of 16.7mm) and had a simple moulding (5-6mm long), now worn. There is no surviving evidence for casting runner stubs on the mouth (with a maximum surviving thickness of 4.7mm). The side and faces have a concave slope from the mouth, becoming parallel near the end (with a width of 13.3mm). It is possible to tentatively suggest the presence of a casting seam on the side. No decoration is evident on the fragment. The interior of the socket is roughly-cast and the base of the socket is not obvious (probably a base thickness of 6-7mm and socket depth of 46mm). The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a bronze-brown colour.\n\n\n\nSocketed hammers are comparatively unusual discoveries, the quadrangular form of this example is more typical of examples sometimes associated with Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park metalwork, although early hammers have been found associated with metalwork dating to the end of the Middle Bronze Age. Two other hammers are recorded from Wales at present, both from North Wales; one from the Bronze Age occupation soil behind the rampart of the hillfort at the Breiddin (D.G. Coombs 1991 in Musson ed., mo. 139, 3 133-4)[1], the Breiddin hammer is sub-quadrangular in form and is expanded at the working platform. The other known example is an unpublished, example from Burton, Wrexham (Gwilt pers comm.) and is more rounded in form. Hammers often have a higher tin content in the bronze (Coombs ibid.; Evans; 1881[2]) compared to contemporary axes, it has not been possible to metallurgically analyse this example at present.\n\n\n\n[1] Musson, C.
