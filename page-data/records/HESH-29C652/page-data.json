The fragment represents the lower part of the blade and the upper part of the socket. The point, blade, and lower socket (with associated string-like loops) are missing. Therefore, accurate dimensions of the spears length and width cannot be given. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an irregular cross section. The top of the fragment consists of the upper part of the central rib and is lozenge shaped in cross section; the spearhead expands towards the base of the socket where it is sub-circular in cross section. The base of the socket has been damaged and broken; the internal diameter is approximately 18.7 x 18.2mm. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The fragment measures 54.4mm lengths, has a maximum width of 14.4mm and maximum thickness of 10.3mm. The depth of the socket is 24.1mm. The spearhead weighs 12.86 grams. \n\nThe spearhead is a mid-brown green colour with a relatively complete polished patina that covered all surfaces. This patina has been abraded in several areas and there are a few pock marks from corrosion on the socket. There are also a number of patches of light green powdery corrosion present. As mentioned above the blade of the spearhead is missing. This damage is relatively old as the breaks are worn and abraded. It is suggested that this spearhead fits with similar looped spearheads dated to the Middle Bronze Age, unfortunately the lack of diagnostic features on this examples means that a more detailed and accurate date cannot be achieved.","fourFigureLat":"52.623297","fourFigureLon":"-1.410546","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Peter Reavill","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Market Bosworth","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Hinckley and Bosworth","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-29C652.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"54.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
