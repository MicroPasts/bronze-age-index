Ewart Park Type, Class B, dating to c.1000-800BC.\n\nIt is complete with the loop remaining. It has some corrosion on the surface, particularly around the cutting edge of the blade. In plan the axe is roughly rectangular, in cross section it is triangular as it narrows to the blade.\n\nThere is a slight collar at the top of the axe. At the base of the collar 3 ribs start on each side and run about 1/3 of the way down the axe. The loop starts at the same level and finishes just before the ribs. \n\nCasting lines can be seen on both edges running from top to bottom. They do not appear to have been smoothed out at all. The mouth is sub-square and has 2 casting sprues on the edge. The blade is slightly expanded but some of it is missing due to wear and corrosion. \n\nThe axe has a greenish patina which is not even due to the corrosion. The corrosion is a light green and is worst around the cutting edge of the blade and the mouth.","fourFigureLat":"53.216827","fourFigureLon":"-2.540578","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.47","discoveryContext":"Fieldwalking","parish":"Whitegate and Marton","county":"Cheshire West and Chester","district":"Cheshire West and Chester","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fmcintosh/french socketed axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Liverpool","length":"90.21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
