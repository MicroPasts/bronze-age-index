The axehead is sub rectangular in cross section and has a shallow lenticular side profile. There is likely a proto stop ridge / median bevel which is now barely visible due to corrosion and the developed patina. The axehead has a slightly rounded butt end. The external edges are worn and have a slight hammer raised flange. The object then extends to a crescentic flared blade/cutting edge which is worn. The object has a green to brown coloured pitted surface patina. \n\nThanks are given to Peter Reavill who suggests via comms that the axe head came from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA&nbsp;III) of metalworking stage IV, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 3. There are further examples recorded on the PAS database including DOR-4374E1 discovered in Dorset and NARC-59DFC7 discovered in Northamptonshire. \n\nThe flanged axehead measures 113.5&nbsp;mm in length, 54.8&nbsp;mm in width, 12.6&nbsp;mm in width just above the blade edge and 7 mm at the butt end. It weighs 282&nbsp;grams.","fourFigureLat":"53.26674022","fourFigureLon":"-0.15723643","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hemingby","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vallnatt/WMIDE6F192.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"113.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
