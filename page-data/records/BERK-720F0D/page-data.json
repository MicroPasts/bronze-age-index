OXON-C4D536 on the database which states: Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Awls are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Smither","datefound1":"September 18, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Smither","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clyffe Pypard","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK720F0D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"42.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
