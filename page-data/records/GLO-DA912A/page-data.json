The blade, although missing its tip, is lanceolate in shape (being broadly triangular in plan). There is a pronounced central spine on both faces which is triangular in form having a wide base at the tang that narrows to the tip of the spear. To either side of the spine is a low rib that is flanked by a shallow concave channel. Finally, the edges of the blade are heavily damaged by corrosion. The long and thin tang in broadly rectangular in cross-section with rounded corners, the end of the tang is truncated as a result of corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe following is taken from record DUR-2372A1\n\n\n\nThis form of spearhead is relatively rare with only 47 examples recorded in the recent volume British Bronze Age Spearheads (Davis 2012). This form of spearhead corresponds with Davis's (2017) Group I form and of Arreton Down metalworking dating to the latest part of the Early Bronze Age, (Early Bronze Age III) which correspondes to Needham's (1996) Period 4 dated c. 1700 - 1500BC and Burgess's Metalworking stage VII. Two similar examples of Arreton metalworking tradition spearheads are recorded on the PAS database from Penllyn, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0BF252) and Shalfleet, Isle of Wight (IOW-221956).","fourFigureLat":"51.47107959","fourFigureLon":"-2.82202882","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"March 31, 2018","datefound2":"August 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weston-in-Gordano","county":"North Somerset","district":"North Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLODA912A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"127"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
