It has a leaf or flame shaped blade. The tip of the spear is complete and the left side of the blade is complete with the cutting edge in tact, the right side of the blade is mostly complete aside from a irregular shaped piece missing from two thirds of the way down the blade. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) oval shaped midrib which expands into the socket of the spear. The socket is best described as being conical in shape. The spearhead is broken at a point above the socket, the break is jagged and the edges are abraded and patinated suggesting that the break is an old one, however the pieces detached on lifting when found. The socket is conical and tapers evenly inside the mid rib. At the base of the blade are two broadly rectangular shaped loops each with a rectangular perforation, when the two pieces of the object are together the loops are complete, they have been broken but no part is missing. The loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft, a part of which remains inside both pieces of the socket. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.\n\n\n\nThe object has a maximum length of 165 mm, a maximum width of 40.0 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 24.5 mm and a maximum weight of 97 g.\n\n\n\nPiece 1 (Blade) - has a length of 97.2 mm and a maximum width of 40.0 mm at the base of the blade, the tip is 6.0 mm wide. It has a maximum thickness of 15.9 mm at the base and 4.2 mm at the tip. It weighs 43.7 g\n\n\n\nPiece 2 (Socket) - has a length of 77.3 mm and a width of 23.6 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 24.5 mm at the base and 18.0 mm at the top. It weighs 54.0 g\n\n\n\nMetallurgical composition of the spear was tested using a Mistral tabletop XRF machine at Birmingham Museum Conservation laboratory.

Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nSimilar basal-looped spearheads have been classified by Richard Davis (2006) and dated to the Middle Bronze Age. Davis has sub-classified these into classes / Types. This example corresponds best with his Type 6. Davis dates his Type 6 to the later Acton Park phase (1500-1300 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age the Taunton phase (1400 - 1200BC) and the early Penard phase (1250-1150BC) These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup.Other similar examples have also been recorded on the database, including HESH-BA2F61and HESH-821195.\n\n\n\nRef:\n\n\n\nEhrenberg, M.R., 1977 Bronze Age Spearheads from Berks, Bucks and Oxon Oxford : British Archaeological Reports 34, ,\n\n\n\nDavis, R., 2006 Basal-Looped Spearheads: Typology, chronology, context and use Oxford : BAR,","fourFigureLat":"52.7593659","fourFigureLon":"-2.23852973","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"July 18, 2015","datefound2":"July 18, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Church Eaton","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMID244D11_1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"165"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
