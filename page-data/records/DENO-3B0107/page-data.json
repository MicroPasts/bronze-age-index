BC 1500 - c. BC 1150.\n\n\nMost of the spear remains but the tip, side loops and the bottom half of the base are missing.\n\n\nThe spearhead is sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade, hollow socket and the remains of two cast side loops. The blade (sides and tip) of the spearhead is incomplete having been damaged in the ploughsoil. Therefore, accurate dimensions of the blade length and width cannot be given. The surviving blade measures 44.01 mm in length, and is 28.7 mm wide. Along the centre of the blade is a lozenge (oval) shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear. The socket is sub-oval in cross section and expands evenly along its length. The base of the socket has been damaged and broken, the internal diameter is approximately 12.2 mm. The internal length of the socket is 43.8 mm which suggests that it may extend a short distance into the midrib of the blade. The remains of the two loops are located on either side at the base of the socket, they remain as two oval shaped lugs one on top of the other, evenly spaced, on either side. These two loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. \n\nThe spear measures 71.8 mm length, has a maximum width of 28.7 mm and maximum thickness of 14.5 mm. The blade has a thickness of 9.1 mm, and the wall of the socket is 2.7 mm thick. The spearhead weighs 41.7 grams. \n\nThe spearhead is a dark-brown green colour. Originally it would have had a heavy polished patina that covered all surfaces. This patina has been badly abraded in many areas and there are several large pock marks on both the blade and the socket. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail and has resulted in the loss of part of the base and the tip of the object. \n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (c. 1500 - 1150BC). Others have been recorded on the database, including HESH-218915. \n\nRef:\n\nEhrenberg, M.R., 1977 Bronze Age Spearheads from Berks, Bucks and Oxon Oxford : British Archaeological Reports 34. \n\n\n\nThe missing tip of the spear head was discovered in December 2016 and has been recorded DENO-448691","fourFigureLat":"53.10636278","fourFigureLon":"-1.04546516","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn (Derby)","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn (Derby)","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"12.2","edge":null,"thickness":"14.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Farnsfield","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Newark and Sherwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/helenglenn3/DENO3B0107.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"71.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
