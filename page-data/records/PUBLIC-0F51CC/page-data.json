The axe is sub-triangular in plan and lenticular in section, with thinning of the piece visible at the cutting edge and towards the butt of the axe. The cutting edge itself is convex, with the lateral edges gradually tapering in towards the butt end, which itself is squared off. The axe is relatively well preserved with an even light green patina interspered with darker green pitting covering all its surfaces. The object is broadly symmetrical, although some losses to the edges of the piece are in evidence resulting from post-depositional erosion. The axe is 62.2mm long from cutting edge to butt, it is 5.9mm thick at its midpoint, 38.7mm wide at the cutting edge and 18.7mm wide at the butt end. It weighs 71.7 grammes.\n\n\nThis axe is similar both in proportions and form to Migdale and Hopton type axes, with a good comparison on the PAS database visible in the form of WILT-F21AB1, although this example has a slightly more elongated mid-section and a rounded butt.","fourFigureLat":"51.69795012","fourFigureLon":"-1.56733069","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1700","notes":"\nFound on a Metal Detectives Group rally near Clanfield, Oxfordshire.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alex Bliss as Finder","datefound1":"March 22, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alex Bliss as Finder","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bampton and Clanfield","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abliss/DSCN00091.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"62.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
