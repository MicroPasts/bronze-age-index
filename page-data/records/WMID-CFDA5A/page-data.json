The spearhead is 90% complete; an irregular tear is present along the mid-rib socket between the two blades. The overall shape of the spearhead is broadly leaf shaped, with a 'flame shaped' blade. Two circular peg holes are present, one on either side of the socket. These have an internal diameter of 6.1 mm. The base of the socket is circular and has a depth of 123.7 mm. Blade facets are visible along the edge of the blades on the undamaged side. The spearhead is a dark brown to mid green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion has caused the original surface to flake away in a few areas, these are dark green in colour. This type of spearhead is consistent with that of the Ewart park phase and a parallel can be found in the Shropshire Marches VII hoard. It is consistent with dating between 950 BC and 750 BC.\n\n\n\nIt measures 162 mm in length, a maximum width of 39.3 mm. The socket has an external diameter of 24.6 mm and an internal diameter of 19.7 mm. The walls of the socket are 2.3 mm thick. It weighs 122.1 g.","fourFigureLat":"52.64274116","fourFigureLon":"-2.0014349","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"The 3D model has been generated using mobile phone scanning application Qlone.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"July 03, 2021","datefound2":"July 03, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Essington","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMIDCFDA5A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"162"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
