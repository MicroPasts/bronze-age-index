The blade edge has been lost, along with part of the butt. The body of the axe gradually tapers down to a probable rectangular butt. A recess is present on both front and back, a proto socket. No flanges are present along the edges of the axehead. No sign of decoration is present on any face, although most of the original surface has been lost. The sides are lentoid.\n\n\n\nIt measures 86.7 mm in length, 50.3 mm blade width, 2.5 mm thick (blade edge), 33.5 mm wide (centre), 12.4 mm thick (centre), 20.7 mm wide (butt) and 3.2 mm thick (butt). It weighs 182.1 g.\n\n\n\nThe flat axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion and surface pitting, has resulted in a loss of most of the original surface.\n\n\n\nThis flat axehead is consistent with that of an Arreton, a slightly later developed short flange flat axehead, consistent with Early Bronze Age metalworking phase III and Middle Bronze Age metalworking Phase I (c. 1700 to c. 1500 BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.40892817","fourFigureLon":"-2.13372973","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clent","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Bromsgrove","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID3941D2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"86.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
