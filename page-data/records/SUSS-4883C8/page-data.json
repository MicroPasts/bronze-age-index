The wheel has a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate, narrowing as they do, before flaring slightly where they join the outer rim. The apertures between each spoke are sub-oval and slightly pointed. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle (c.1.0mm diameter) this shows signs of ware on one face. The wheel has a dark green surface with red areas. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: external diameter: 20.48mm; thickness: 2.23mm and weight: 2.17g. \n\n\n\nThere are many similar examples recorded on the database which are recorded as late Bronze Age or early Iron Age/Roman votive wheels e.g. OXON-5C8F8B; GLO-E82DE1, KENT-70F063, SF-987EE3; NMS-1CDC66. However, this example has a very small central perforation and rectangular cross-section more akin to NLM-B563BC, which suggests it is the wheel for an 18/19th century toy cannon.  An example of an 18th century toy cannon with its wheeled carriage in (Forsyth and Egan 2005, page 85 no. 1.17); has similar wheels but notably with only three spokes rather than four. SUR-A965C0 is another example recorded as a toy on the PAS database, but again with three spokes. Therefore, on balance, based on its form a prehistoric date is suggested for this object.","fourFigureLat":"51.16478633","fourFigureLon":"-1.10037851","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20.48","edge":null,"thickness":"2.23","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bradley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS4883C8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
