There is not much difference in width between septum and blade; the particular narrowness of the blade suggests an ancillary use as a chisel. The low flanges are slightly abraded with a small dent in one side. Just beyond the stop ridge on either side is plano-convex indentation. The blade end of the palstave widens from the stop ridge towards the cutting edge while reducing in thickness. The cutting edge is crescentic with slightly expanded and curved tips; the blade edge itself is bevelled on each side and narrow to a thin, sharp cutting edge. The casting seams along the edge of the palstave have been filed; pitting along the seam appears to have been filled with a molten bronze. Hammer-marks are visible along both sides.\n\nThe palstave dates to the late Middle Bronze Age or early Late Bronze Age, most likely within the late Taunton or possibly Penard metalwork assemblages, that is c. 1250-1000 BC, corresponding with Needham Period 5-6, Burgess metalworking phase IX - X. It can be compared with narrow bladed palstaves from the Sidlesham hoard, now in Chichester Museum (Rowlands 1976, Vol. 2, p. 269/pl. 8; ref. 148, especially 148.3); Rowlands classifies them as Class 1 narrow bladed palstaves. In discussing the form (ibid., Vol. 1, pp. 36-38), Rowlands notes they are common in early Late Bronze Age hoards in Southern Britain. At the time, the origin of these palstaves was thought to be Northern France.","fourFigureLat":"51.86677597","fourFigureLon":"-1.18810963","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wendlebury","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"160"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
