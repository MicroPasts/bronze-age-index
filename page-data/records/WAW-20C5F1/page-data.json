The socket in section is a sub-circle. The upper most tip of the blade has broken off, and is missing. The break is not a recent break. In profile this portion of the blade is bent slightly due to damage. The edges of the blade are convex tapering towards the tip. \n\n\n  \n  The socket of the spear head tapers slightly towards the blade. The lower edge of the socket is torn and is not the original edge. On either side of the socket, integral to the surface there are incomplete side loops. The internal diameter of the socket is 13.5mm, but this is not the lower edge. \n\n\n  \n  The spearhead is a patchy mid-brown green coloured patina. In length it is 150.4mm long, 20.2mm wide across the loops and 16.5mm thick across the socket. It weighs 59.98g.","fourFigureLat":"52.057628","fourFigureLon":"-1.578452","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"September 12, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-20C5F1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Candy Stevens","length":"150.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
