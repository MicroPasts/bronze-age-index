The axe has a narrow butt that gradually expands in width towards the cutting edge. The axe widens more sharply where the sides meet the cutting edge. The cutting edge is convex. The butt is rectangular in cross-section and the blade's cross-section is a pointed oval shape. The end iof the butt is at an angle rather than straight, indicating that the axe head was broken in antiquity.\n\n\n\nThe blade is pitted badly on both sides.
