Only a very short part of the blade edge survives (7mm). The casting seam is evident on the surviving side, with the suggestion that the sides are angled to the centre. The side is slightly convex across its surviving length. Both face are slightly convex across their lengths with no discernible blade facet or ribs surviving. The surface is corroded with some surviving dark green patina.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the object makes identification difficult and typological identification indeterminate. Although it is possible to tentatively suggest the base of a socket on the fragment and together with angled sides, indicating a hexagonal body section may indicate a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date, c. 750 â€“ 600BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.4645671","fourFigureLon":"-3.48411224","fromdate":"-750","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2015512.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"25.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
