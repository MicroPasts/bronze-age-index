These are nos 166 and 167 in Gerloff's catalogue respectively and the date is c. late Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork tradition, that is c. 1100-800BC. Gerloff does date the buckets into the Llyn Fawr period, but I am not sure what her evidence is - I certainly haven't seen any bucket fragments from EIA hoards or contexts and I have seen them if not all, then most of them I would say.\"\n\n\n\n\"The loop on this example is not complete, i.e. 360 degrees. It is usually around 180-190 degrees and ridged like this example. The ridging derives from separately cast rings that were soldered together somehow - the later ones, like this example, only have ridges left. The ends of the 180/190 degree circle are attached to a staple/clamp which in turn clamps around the vessel opening/rim. The rim is usually rolled up or folded or strengthened with a rod (like in the example above) because usually, the handles were too fragile to lift a bronze bucket or cauldron, especially when it was filled/full. The sheet metal would rip and I think this is probably what happened in this example from Dowalton. There are other handles with handle attachments from hoards and buckets/cauldrons are incredibly rare.\"","fourFigureLat":"51.422115","fourFigureLon":"0.414887","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"Gerloff, S. 2010.
