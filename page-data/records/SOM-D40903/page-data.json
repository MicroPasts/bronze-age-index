At the wider end, the item's width is 14.4mm From this end the original surviving edges of the item subtly curve outwards before curving in again to the second broken edge of the item which is also the point of its minimum width, 9.3mm. This broken end is now slightly concave. In cross section the artefact is a pointed oval with a maximum thickness of 2.2mm and, one one face, distinct carinations between the central part, representing about a third of the width and the edges. It has no clearly defined mid-rib or edge bevels.\n\n\n\nThe object is covered in a thick dark green patina which is only slightly abraded in places.\n\n\n\nIt is, 15.7mm long, and weighs 1.71\n\n\n\nThe regular form of the fragment and its size suggest this possibly represent a fragment of a Bronze Age tool, such as a rapier or knife, an example with similar dimensions albeit far better preserved is SOM-71AABB.","fourFigureLat":"51.09608065","fourFigureLon":"-2.22986222","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"October 06, 2018","datefound2":"January 07, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"21.3","edge":null,"thickness":"2.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Knoyle","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOMD40903.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"15.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
