The butt is damaged with an old break but survives to its original width, 21.3mm. The palstave has a sub-rectangular septum, with a vertical stop ridge on both faces (one notably more worn than the other). The septum is 6.2mm thick and 16.7mm wide, it survives to a length of 24.8mm and is flanged, with these sub-triangular in profile, although again notably more worn on one face than the other.\n\n\n\nAt the stop ridge the palstave is sub-rectangular in cross section, 20.8mm wide and 19.3mm thick, and was likely originally more regular in shape. Below the stop ridges the axe then costricts to 18.0mm wide, before widening gradually towards the cutting edge, one corner of which has been lost to an old break. The maximum width, just prior to this break is 22.0mm and although it will originally have continued to broaden, the cutting edge now survives to a width of 17.4mm. In profile the blade of the axe tapers gradually from the stop ridge to a point, now fairly rounded by abrasion. There is no indication of any side loop, but it is unclear whether or not there was any moulding beneath the stop ridge.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is 92.6mm long and weighs 133.89g.\n\n\n\nAlthough difficult to be certain with such an abraded object, the lack of side loops would suggest that it belongs to the Acton Park or Taunton metal working groups, giving the object a likely Middle Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"50.72236833","fourFigureLon":"-3.10635684","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"\nWe are indebted to the finder for providing the original photographs. \n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"September 22, 2014","datefound2":"September 22, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Colyton","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwootton/DEV669688.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Danielle Wootton","length":"92.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
