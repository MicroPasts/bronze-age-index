It is comprised of a small portion of the body that expands into a slightly flared crescentic blade, which retains a blunt but bevelled edge.  The front and back faces of the axehead are marginally convex, whereas the sides are flat.  \n\n\n\nThe axehead has a bright light green patina with extensive surface pitting.  At the broken end it has light brown corrosion, which creates a marked textural change on the object; small patches of this corrosion can also be seen on the front and back faces and also one side.\n\n\n\nSimilar in form to Rohl and Needham (1998:134), fig.36, no. E and OXON-C31839.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 37.47mm, width: 35.36 - 28.49mm, height: 13.67 - 29.95mm, weight: 61.38g","fourFigureLat":"50.88648397","fourFigureLon":"-1.16261373","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alexandra Cobby","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alexandra Cobby","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"13.67","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Boarhunt","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC9CB129.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"37.47"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
