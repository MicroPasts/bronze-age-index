The fragment consists of the cutting edge and lower blade of a late Bronze Age axe (1100 - 800 BC). The axe fragment is sub-rectangular in plan with a curved (convex) cutting edge. The sides, adjacent to the cutting edge, taper inwards towards the break. In profile the fragment is sub-triangular (wedge shaped). The convex cutting edge of the axe fragment, although corroded and abraded, is worn suggesting it was heavily used in antiquity. The break at the top of the fragment is old and abraded and has an uneven edge. The break has occurred almost at the base of the socket. The base of the socket is elliptical in plan and broadly 'u' shaped in cross section. The axe fragment is a light- green to brown colour with a polished but much abraded patina. The loss of patina is mostly around the external edges of the axe at both the cutting edge and broken edge caused by abrasion in the ploughsoil. It is most prominent along the cutting edge and one side has more prominent patina loss than the other. There are a number of small patches of light green powdery (active) corrosion present predominantly on the edges of the blade.\n\n\n\nThere are other examples on the database that have been discovered in Kingstone, Herefordshire (HESH-5AE5C8) and at Wixford, Warwickshire (WAW-2FC2AE).\n\n\n\nFrom the cutting edge to the broken edge the axe measures 26.4mm, the axe is 54.5mm in width, and is 16.2mm thick. It weighs 65.8 grams.The width of the internal socket is 4.8mm and the length is 32.3 mm.","fourFigureLat":"52.98291285","fourFigureLon":"-2.58233671","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Victoria Allnatt","datefound1":"October 21, 2014","datefound2":"October 21, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dodcott cum Wilkesley","county":"Cheshire East","district":"Cheshire East","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vickyallnatt/HESHB9F20D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"26.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
