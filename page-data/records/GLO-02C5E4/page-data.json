The tang is a narrow rectangular tab 2mm thick and 11.5mm wide, the terminal of which is now truncated, one side of the tang has a small semi-circular notch where a rivet would have secured the handle, the other side has been damaged by corrosion which has removed any detail. The blade has a low flat central spine that runs down from the tang on both faces of the knife, this is flanked by double bevelled sides that create a narrow edge. The forward portion of the knife is truncated.\n\n\n\nA number of similar objects are recorded on the PAS database as DOR-FAC625, WILT-83A428, SF-4CB1D2, and BERK-AB297D- the first two demonstrating a rivet hole in the tang, and the last two with notched sides for attachment.\n\n\n\nDot Boughton comments in reference to the DOR record cited above that; 'Burgess and Gerloff include a blade of similar shape and size in their Group II (Damaged Blades Modified for Rehafting), p. 36ff.
