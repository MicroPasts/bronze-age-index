The remains of the raised edge, in the form of a shield, can be seen from the stop ridge below onto the top of the blade. The left side of the palstave, from the butt end to the blade end, retains the raised casting seam, but the left side is more corroded and there is only a small section of the casting seam remaining, running half of the length of the side of the flange. The casting seam is off-centre, like the other palstave found nearby, but the shield shape is shorter and more rounded, suggesting that the palstaves were made in different moulds. The surface of the palstave is very pitted and has many raised circular lumps, which suggests that it has been in a suitably wet or corrosive environment to develop such areas of bronze disease. The palstave is 156 mm in length, the blade end is 51 mm wide and 6 mm thick and the butt end is 26 mm wide and 9 mm thick. The flanged area is 33 mm thick.
