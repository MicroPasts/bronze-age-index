The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 42.8mm and 13.2mm respectively). The axe is likely to have had a sub-rectangular section at the break but both faces are now dished as a result of battering the socket from both faces. The battering appears to have occurred at the base of the socket, although this cannot be demonstrated because of the sediment within the socket. The surviving part of the side is straight and near-parallel before diverging gently to a slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 47.9mm). The sides of the axe are rounded across their thickness with the casting seam evident running along the centre and neatly finished. The blade edge is comparatively straight, rounded near the tips. Both faces are dished beneath the break and suggest considerable force was applied; one face has a linear indentation from the more complete side, while the other face has a rounded depression. Beneath the break on one face is the base of a decorative rib, suggesting three parallel or near-parallel ribs. No ribs are now discernible on the other face. Beneath the impact damage on the blade, the faces are slightly convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facet evident. The surface is damaged and torn around the impact area but has mid &lsquo;olive&rsquo; green patina surviving elsewhere. \n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 &ndash; 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form and ribbed decoration are likely to suggest Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC) and possibly of South Wales or allied axe type. The damage to the axe is deliberate, perhaps as an attempt to close the socket, as seen on other axes with deliberate damage.","fourFigureLat":"51.4844426","fourFigureLon":"-3.32633314","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Peterston-super-Ely","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20161251.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"61.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
