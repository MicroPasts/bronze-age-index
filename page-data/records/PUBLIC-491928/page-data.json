The palstave has broken before the butt (where it has a width of 21.9mm, a thickness at the septum of 6.5mm and a flange height of 13.1mm). The septum has a U-shaped profile before the rounded stop. The flanges (with a maximum height of 27.7mm) are not as deep as the stop height (at 30.6mm high) but may have suffered some damage. The tops of the flanges have a fairly linear convergence towards the butt. The sides of the palstave are straight as far as the blade, before gradually widening to the damaged blade tips. The casting flashes are evident on both sides and have been finished, probably by hammering but remain prominent, particularly along the sides of the blade. There are unusual mouldings running across both sides, corresponding with the position of the stops. The maximum blade thickness (at 22mm) is less than the stop height, defining a bar ledge stop. The flanges do not continue as ribs along the edges of the blade faces. The original blade edge and the tips have been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 55.0mm) and the blade edge has a moderate curve. A blade facet is discernible on both faces (up to 10mm from the damaged blade edge). The blade face is decorated with a sunken shield pattern and a midrib; the midrib does not continue into the shield as seen on the three-pronged trident' decoration. Angled striations running off the blade edge may be the result of sharpening. The palstave surface has a dark green patina where it survives and elsewhere is pitted and pale green. Occasional air bubbles are evident on the surface and are frequent through the break, demonstrating casting problems and resulting in weaknesses.\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981, p 134) note that unlooped broad blade palstaves are rarely found in Wales and the Marches but enough with trident decoration are know from the Marches and North Wales to suggest that the area may have been a source for Type Wantage palstaves.","fourFigureLat":"52.125984","fourFigureLon":"-3.009321","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 16, 2010","datefound2":"August 10, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eardisley","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.4i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"133.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
