The object can be classified as the Ewart Park phase of metalwork.\n\n\n\nThe object is sub-rectangular in plan with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge.\n\n\n\nThe socket has a sub square mouth, is deep and the insides are smooth.\n\n\n\nA moulded collar decorates the axe below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs. The ribs have been abraded and damaged in recent times. The front and back faces of the axe are faceted at the socket end.\n\n\n\nAlong the centre of each side of the axe is a pronounced casting seam. The seams have not been filed down. One side of the axe has a large semi-circular moulded side loop. The object has a mid to dark brown patina which has chipped away around the cutting edge with evidence of corrosion. On one face of the object are deep cuts running at a diagonal to the object.\n\n\n\nThe object can be classified as the Ewart park phase of metal work which corresponds with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC.The length is 82mm, the width is 53mm thickness and the weight 134.80g.","fourFigureLat":"53.90084997","fourFigureLon":"-2.27542858","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"June 04, 2018","datefound2":"June 04, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rimington","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM5E2C89.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"82"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
