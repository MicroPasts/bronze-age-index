The damaged butt is narrow and arched (with a width of 20mm and a thickness of 5.2mm). The sides are somewhat damaged but appear to be near-straight and divergent or gently concave, before widening more sharply near the blade (with a surviving blade edge width of 64.2mm and a thickness of 6.1mm) but not expanded. The straight blade does not have an edge and it is unclear whether the edge is truncated or was unworked. Both faces are flat (10.6mm 50mm from the blade end), although one face more so and suggests it was in contact with the mould during casting. The original surface has been lost and the surface is heavily-pitted and has a bright-green and light-brown corrosion. Damage at the sides (54mm) from the butt exposes a lamination running along the axe and evident from both sides and probably the result of the casting process. \n\n\n\nThe axe has few diagnostic or developed features and has lost most of the edges, making any identification uncertain. The ‘as-cast’ face suggests that the axe is unworked and therefore may be interpreted as an axe blank. The general form with narrow butt and broad blade is perhaps closer to Migdale axe forms and suggests a contemporary date Visual analysis suggests the metal is a bronze, rather than copper but it has not been possible to scientifically test the alloy. If possible, analysis later may provide further evidence for the date of the axe.","fourFigureLat":"51.8541318","fourFigureLon":"-4.80382799","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"New Moat","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017159new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"141.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
