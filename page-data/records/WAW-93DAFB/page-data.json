The copper alloy spearhead consists of the upper portion of the spear, being broken above the socket. The tip is also damaged and abraded. In plan the spearhead is an elongated sub-triangle with the blade facets and tip all being abraded. The spear blades cutting edges have therefore been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The spearhead has a bi-convex shaped cross section. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the spearhead has a dark grey/green coloured patina which is incomplete. It measures 36.82mm long, 13mm wide, 7.6mm thick and weighs 9.04g.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.","fourFigureLat":"52.26505355","fourFigureLon":"-1.84023963","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"December 01, 2018","datefound2":"December 01, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Morton Bagot","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW93DAFB.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"36.82"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
