The butt is modestly rounded, though with angular corners. The sides are straight, but slightly divergent for just under three quarters of the length of the axe, curving out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded and deeply crescentic cutting edge. All of the original blade edges have been removed by erosion, thereby preventing accurate calculation of the original width and recurve of the blade edge. Approximately 57mm from the butt end is a straight stop-ridge across the axe. The margins of the septum are defined by shallow flanges, which appear to have been hammered up, rather than being cast. The axe sides are faceted: each has an angled mid-ridge, each facet being covered with hammer marks. These tend to be aligned at a consistent diagonal angle across both facets, with no apparent pattern. Nevertheless, they provide some decorative quality to the axe sides. On one upper septum face, there are feint linear dashes or scratches running longitudinally, possibly decorative rain-drop decoration, now barely visible. On each upper blade margin there is a distinct, shallow, hammered crescentic groove, defining the edge of the blade bevel. Striations are visible on each blade bevel, indicating that the blade was prepared and sharpened. Original surfaces survive over most of the axe and these have dark brown patination. However, original surfaces have been lost on the butt, down one lower side, in patches over one blade bevel and around the blade edge. Here, the bronze has a light green patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.989957","fourFigureLon":"-2.895274","fromdate":"-1950","todate":"-1750","notes":"This axe can be classed as Type Bandon (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or a probable Class 4 (follow Needham 1983; forthcoming), dating to Periods 3-4 of the Early Bronze Age (c.1950-1500 BC) (Needham 1996). Class 4 axes straddle the boundary between Periods 2 and 3, but this axe can be confidently assigned to Period 3, probably falling within the late Aylesford to Willerby metalworking phases (c.1950-1750 BC) (Needham et al. 1997). At the time of writing (Aug 2017) 27 Class 4 axes dating to this period are currently known from across Wales, the vast majority being single finds.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"February 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Overton","county":"Wrexham","district":"Wrexham","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"132.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
