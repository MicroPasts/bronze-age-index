A fragment of a copper alloy sword blade. The fragment is from the blade, broken across the blade on both ends, resulting in a slight curved or s-shaped profile in section. The cross section shows a convex middle section which then thins towards each blade edge. The curved cross-section suggests that the fragment stems from the upper section of the blade, towards the hilt. Both blade edges are damaged along the length, meaning the original cutting edge is destroyed probably prior to deposition. There appears to be some modern damage to the surface, with deeper scratches and striations revealing a brighter patina.\n\n\n\nDimensions - length: 6.5cm, width: 3.15cm, thickness (max): 0.7cm, weight: 64.31g\n\n\n\n2) copper alloy fragment.  An irregular fragment of copper alloy, which appears to have a flat surface as one face, whilst the others are irregular and uneven suggesting this is a piece of casting waste or part of a rough round-shaped ingot.\n\n\n\nDimensions - length (max): 4.6cm, width (max): 2.5cm, thickness (max): 1.7cm, weight: 49g.\n\n\n\n3) copper alloy fragment.  A small fragment of copper alloy of irregular shape. There is one flat surface, with an opposite face which appears slightly rounded. The fragment has irregular breaks around all sides revealing an irregular surface. Along with fragment No.2, this could also be part of an ingot.\n\n\n\nDimensions - length (max): 2.2cm, width (max): 1.9cm, thickness: 1.4cm, weight: 19.61g.\n\n\n\n4) fragment of a socketed and looped axehead.  Body fragment of a socketed and looped copper alloy axehead, consisting of one face from the socket to approximately half way down the body towards the blade. The fragment has irregular breaks along both sides, and the loop survives along with visible casting seams on both side faces. The break across the blade face is straight and linear, perpendicular to the direction of the axe. The socket has a prominent moulded rim, followed by a parallel moulded ridge c.1cm from the rim leading to an undecorated body. The loop survives intact and begins from the second moulded ridge. From the surviving fragment of the socket, it is possible to suggest that the socket would have been rounded or sub-square. The fragment is quite corroded but there are patches of the original patinaed surface, some of which show scratches.\n\n\n\nDimensions - Length (incomplete): 6cm, width (at socket): 3.6cm, loop length: 2cm, loop width: 0.85cm, weight: 117.11g.\n\n\n\n5) fragment of a socketed axehead. A fragment of a copper alloy socketed axe. The fragment includes the narrow asymmetrical blade and most of the axe body, with an irregular break across the body. The visible socket is sub-rectangular in cross-section. The fragment is in good condition but the surface has suffered from corrosion. And the lack of diagnostic features remaining makes it difficult to identify a type.\n\n\n\nDimensions - axe length 6.7cm (incomplete), blade width: 3.9cm, width at break: 2cm, weight: 115.88g.\n\n\n\n6) fragment of a socketed axehead.  A large body and blade fragment of a copper alloy socketed axehead, with an irregular break across the body of the axe. Casting seams are visible along each edge, and a number of scratches are visible on the surface in a variety of directions which are likely to a mixture of ancient and more recent damage. There is a clear scuffing of one edge which was probably caused during the recovery of the objects. The cross section of the interior is sub-rectangular, and the body runs straight before flaring into the rounded blade edge.\n\n\n\nDimensions - length (max): 6.9cm, blade width: 4.4cm, width (at break): 3cm, weight: 136.32g.\n\n\n\n7) fragment of a socketed and looped axehead. A fragment of a copper alloy socketed and looped axehead, surviving from the base of the loop to half way down the body of the axe, both the socket rim portion and blade edge section are missing. The socket is sub-square in cross-section at the top break at the base of the loop, and widens to sub-rectangular at the second break across the blade body. The fragment comes from a narrow bodied axehead.\n\n\n\nDimensions - length: 4cm, width: 2.4cm (at loop), side width: 2.4cm (at loop), weight: 85.2g.\n\n\n\n8) fragment of a socketed axehead.  A small fragment of a copper alloy socketed axehead, consisting of one face from the upper part of the blade. The surface appears to taper out slightly suggesting this fragment is from the middle section of the blade body. In section, the fragment is slightly curved suggesting it has been bent. On one side the casting seem is visible, and linear striations suggest to polishing or working of the axe once cast. All edges of the fragments are created by breaks, one appears to be straight whereas the break at the narrower of the tapered face, and those along the sides are irregular. There are no identifiable features surviving on this fragment.\n\n\n\nDimensions - length: 2.7cm, width (max): 2.8cm, width (min): 1.2cm, thickness:0.4cm, weight: 16.32g.\n\n\n\n9) fragment of an axehead. A blade fragment of a copper alloy axehead. The fragment has a linear break across the body of the axe, running perpendicular to the direction of the axe body. The cutting edge is asymmetrical and damaged, although it is likely that the large chips have been removed post-deposition. There is evidence of recent damage on one face perhaps caused during the recovery of the artefacts. The blade is flared slightly, and the sides appear to be faceted leading up to the main portion of the blade body which is now missing. The break reveals a solid interior, with no signs of a socket visible.\n\n\n\nDimensions - length: 3.5cm, blade width: 4.3cm, side width (at break): 1.2cm, weight: 55.35g.\n\n\n\n10) fragment of an axehead.  A blade fragment of a copper alloy axehead. The fragment has a linear break across the body, perpendicular to the direction of the blade. the blade edge is irregular through a mixture of ancient and more recent damage; however, the blade would have been asymmetrical prior to deposition.\n\n\n\nDimensions - blade width: 4.5cm, length: 3.2cm, width: 0.8cm, weight: 53.35g.\n\n\n\n11) copper alloy artefact.  A small cylindrical piece of possible copper alloy, although the red/brown colour of the surface suggests some surface erosion. The object is cylindrical, and appears to have linear casting seams or ridges along each side. Both ends are rounded.\n\n\n\nDimensions = length: 3.7cm, width: 1.4cm, thickness: 0.95, weight: 22.63g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion/ identification\n\n\n\nNo. 1 is identifiable as a sword fragment from the upper part of the blade body. Due to the convex-concave cross-section it is possible to suggest that the fragment comes from a leaf-shaped sword, however a definite identification is impossible due to the significant percentage of the sword which is missing. Due to its association with socketed ace fragments in this group of objects, it could be argued that the fragment comes from a Ewart Park type sword (see Burgess and Colquhoun 1988:66).\n\n\n\nFragments Nos.2 & 3 are irregular and do not resemble any recognisable artefact. The flat surface that each fragment has could suggest they are part of a copper alloy/bronze ingot.\n\n\n\nDue to the double rib moulding at the socket, axe fragment No.4 can be loosely categorised as belonging to the South-Eastern type (Schmidt and Burgess 1981:212, Plate 85). South-Eastern axes are characterised by a 'fairly slender, square to rectangular sectioned body with a squarish mouth' (ibid). Axe fragments Nos. 5-8 lack any clear features by which they can be identified, and so they cannot be categorised beyond belonging to socketed axes.\n\n\n\nThe blade fragments, Nos. 9-10, are likely to belong to a socketed axe due to the presence of other socketed fragments in this assemblage. Because the break is close to the blade tip, the interior is solid in both these fragments and whilst it is more likely that the break occurred below the limit of the socket, these fragments cannot be definitely identified as socketed axeheads or tools.\n\n\n\nNo.11 is an irregular cylindrical object which is not identifiable as a clear artefact type, however its shape and the presence of casting seams or ridges show that it was a deliberately cast object. Although not diagnostic, a prehistoric date is at least possible.\n\n\n\nThis assemblage was found by the same finder and in the same location as the Tendring Hoard (2015 T590) and is arguably part of the same hoard of material. The 2015 T590 assemblage included complete and incomplete socketed axes, as well as sword fragments and ingots, therefore the character of the collection described above is similar to the original assemblage discovered. Although this assemblage does not include some of the identifiable socketed axe types which the main hoard did (notably the Yorkshire Type axeheads), the fragmented axes and the broken probable South-Eastern type (No.4), are comparable to a large group of fragmented axes found in T90. The report for 2015 T590 concludes that the hoard belongs to the Later Bronze Age, and the later part of the Ewart Park Phase (c.950-800 BC), although it was noted that the presence of later artefacts within the original assemblage suggested it dated from the transitional period between the Bronze and Iron Age.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\nBurgess, C.
