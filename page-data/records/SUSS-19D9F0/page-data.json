The surviving portion is wedge shaped, with rectangular faces which are almost straight when seen from the side, and that meet to form a curving blade edge that appears to have had little secondary bevel. The sides, when looking at the face, are slightly concave along the length, curving outwards to the blade. The middle of the blade edge has broken off in the past, but appears once to have a narrow curve of maybe 120°, with no flaring of the tips; the rounded tips are 19.31m apart. The hollow interior is cone-shaped. The artefact has a sub-rectangular cross-section with walls between 2.06mm and 4.34mm thick. The artefact has been broken off at the end, but it appears that part of the butt is still present: if this is correct then the artefact was once around 47-50mm in length. There is a casting seam running along one face. There is no decoration on the artefact, suggesting an everyday rather than ceremonial purpose. The artefact is very worn, with heavy corrosion, although some of the original smooth surface survives (around 40%), with a light greenish-grey colour. The rest has a mottled, greenish-grey colour, and a very pitted texture. All the evidence points towards this being a tool for carving wood- that is for ornamental carving. The round blade edge would make it versatile, enabling the carver to work with a concave area, and the bevel of the whole tool- at around 20°, makes it ideal for very fine work where thin slivers of wood are being removed. This is a fine ¾ inch chisel. The fact that it is cast with an integral socket (for the wooden handle it once had) suggests a Middle- Late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"50.841771","fourFigureLon":"0.200131","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Liz Andrews-Wilson","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Liz Andrews-Wilson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.67","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Arlington","county":"East Sussex","district":"Wealden","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lwilson/3-57.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"46.92"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
