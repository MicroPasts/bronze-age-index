The chisel is incomplete, as the rectangular shaft is broken. The shaft widens towards a circular collar which expands into a sub triangular blade. The bottom of this blade is also broken, areas of it have been chipped away. The whole object is slightly curved, something that might have happened over time. The metal is dark brown in colour and it weighs 20.0g. It measures 76.23mm in length, 34.34mm at its widest point and 6.54mm at its thickest point.
