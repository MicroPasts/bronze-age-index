Only the tip end of the spear head remains. The fragment is sub triangular in shape, narrowing towards the tip of the spear, the tip of which is worn and broken. The fragment is lozenge shaped in cross section. Running down the centre of the fragment on both sides is a raised midrib. The blade edges have been worn and there are notches along both the edges.
