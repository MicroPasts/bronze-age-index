All that remains of this axehead is the cutting edge, blade tip and part of the blade. It is possibly a Penard/Wilburton type, though exact categorisation is difficult as only a small portion of the axehead remains. The fragment measures 30.15mm in length and 35.63mm at maximum width on the cutting edge, before tapering down to 29.22mm on the blade. What remains of the axehead is triangular in cross-section. The patina is quite smooth, and light green in colour. The cutting edge has worn smooth. In total, the fragment weighs 43.54g.","fourFigureLat":"51.50989779","fourFigureLon":"-1.91493675","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Fiona Johnstone","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Fiona Johnstone","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wootton Bassett","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/flojohnstone/WILT43B254.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"30.15"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
