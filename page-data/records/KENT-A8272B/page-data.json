Uncertain date possibly Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nDescription: The object is circular in plan and sub-conical. Four circular-sectioned runners project from the body of the object at irregular points on the body. The upper surface is dished with a rough surface. The object has a mid-green patina.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 27.42mm in length, 31.46mm long, 26.24mm wide, 56.55g\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Casting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below. As they represent re-usable metal, they were often retained and regularly turn up in base metal hoards of the Bronze Age. C.f PAS record BH-8DDE6E. A similar casting jet albeit probably form a South-Wales type axe is recorded at LVPL-0C459C. A late Bronze Age date is therefore tentatively suggested.","fourFigureLat":"51.20681886","fourFigureLon":"1.148148","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"27.42","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barham","county":"Kent","district":"Canterbury","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTA8272B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"31.46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
