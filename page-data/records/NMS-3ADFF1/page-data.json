Surfaces are an even brown with two patches of verdigris, one area covered by a thin blue deposit and another with streaks of rust. The non-recent break (old, but not ancient, likely to be post-depositional) between the parts is the result of bending while the upper break appears similar though there is no sign of distortion. Both faces of the blade are similar, a broad central convexity taking up most of the width and flanked by narrow ribs running parallel with the sharp edges. The ribs die out 82mm above the tip. Weight 386g. Extant length 420mm (both parts are 210mm long). Width and thickness at break 29.4 and 7.2mm. Maximum width, near mid-point of upper part, 31mm. Width and thickness at upper break 26 and 7.8mm. c.1000 - c.800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.62482744","fourFigureLon":"0.52490383","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Rogerson","datefound1":"January 01, 2021","datefound2":"July 15, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Rogerson","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barton Bendish","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/PFd_20388_3ADFF1_SB062021_BA_Sword_a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"420"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
