The axe has a width of 47.7mm and a thickness of 9.6mm at the break and is of sub rectangular section. One of the sides is comparatively straight, while the other side is concave and divergent to produce a moderately expanded blade edge. The blade has a width of 68.2mm. The surviving areas of the faces are concave and would have produced a lenticular profile across the length of the axe. The axe has poor surface preservation with areas of pale green patina on one face, elsewhere the surface is brown.","fourFigureLat":"51.46646441","fourFigureLon":"-3.32581167","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2050","notes":"Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefacts was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The objects were examined whole within the specimen chamber and were analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. All the results presented are semi-quantitative. The results demonstrated that the axe is almost pure copper, but some arsenic was detected (99% Copper, 1% arsenic).","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Nicholas and Bonvilston","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200736.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"67.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
