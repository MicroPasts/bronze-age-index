The sides curve inwards from the curved crescent blade-edge, flaring in section to a rectangle. The break across the body is irregular. The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to dark brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety. It looks like it was not faceted or had a ribbed decoration.\n\n\n\nMasurements: 27.3mm long, 36.16mm wide, 12.81mm thick and 31.2g in weight","fourFigureLat":"50.98100948","fourFigureLon":"0.83361096","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.81","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ivychurch","county":"Kent","district":"Shepway","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTC91A27.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"27.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
