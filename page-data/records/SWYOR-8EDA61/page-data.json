It is probably a Willerby style axe. It has a crescent shaped blade which is wider than the body of the axe. The original cutting egde does not survive. The body of the axe is rectangular in section and is unusually thick for a flat axe, suggesting development towards palstave forms. It does not have flanges but the edges are very slightly raised. There is no stop ridge, but the thickest part of the axe is in the centre of the body, and the change of angle forms a line where the stop ridge would develop on later axes. The sides are concave and the faces are two flat facets. The butt also tapers to a thin wedge which may have been crescentic, but is no longer complete. Much of the original surface survives which is a smooth brown patina. Where this is missing, the surface is pitted and rough, and is slightly more green. \n\n\n\nThe axe appears to be similar to number 55 on page 125 of Rohl and Needham's BM Occasional Paper number 102 which is described as Willerby metalwork, class 4 axe. Willerby metalwork dates from 1900BC - 1700 BC. There are few other axes of this type on the PA database for comparison: LANCUM-049465 is more severely damaged, and LVPL-004D33 has more developed flanges.","fourFigureLat":"53.989581","fourFigureLon":"-1.406682","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Carole Bloom","datefound1":"January 01, 2011","datefound2":"December 31, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carole Bloom","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.75","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Goldsborough","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bloom/PAS_1770_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"78.44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
