The blade is a pointed oval form with a distinct, raised central rib which runs down the length of both sides of the object to the base of the socket. The socket has a side loop, lozengiform in plan and almost flat in cross-section on each side. There are casting seams visible down the length of the shaft. Small sections of the edge of the socket are broken and missing, however a retained semi-circular portion on one side of the socket suggests a peg hole in the shaft. The socket has been distorted by post depositional processes and is twisted and missing a large portion below the side loops.\n\n\n\nThe metal is a dark greenish brown in colour with a slightly pitted patina.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples can be seen on the Portable Antiquities Database: BERK-9565A5, BERK-4D4F74 and SWYOR-6DA833\n\n\n\nLength: 133.65mm, Width: 23.31mm, Thickness: 11.76mm, Weight: 38.80g.","fourFigureLat":"52.75439241","fourFigureLon":"1.12524406","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Ellie Cox","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Booton","county":"Norfolk","district":"Broadland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox/DURA7968E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"133.65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
