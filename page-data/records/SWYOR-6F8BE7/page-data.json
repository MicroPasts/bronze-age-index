The axehead is cast from copper alloy and is of the Ewart Park tradition.  The axehead is complete and in good condition and has a piece of wood inside the socket mouth, this fragment is loose and it is unclear as to whether this is a piece of the original haft or a later intrusion.  It has been handled and so would not be datable.  \n \n \nThe axehead has a square socket mouth with a small protrusion on one edge and a single moulded rim.  Below the rim on one side of the axehead is the loop (with an oval section).  The faces of the axehead are plain and a casting seam is present down both sides of the object.  The blade is expanded; measuring 40.1mm across the cutting edge, and there are blade tip hollows.  The blade edge is intact with few signs of wear.  The patina is greeny brown.\n    \n \n The axehead weighs 160.44g (including wooden fragment) and 154.44 (without wood).  It measure 83.19mm in length, 41.7mm in width (across mouth and loop) and 34.4mm in width (across mouth).","fourFigureLat":"54.368413","fourFigureLon":"-2.155419","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Marshall","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Marshall","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"34.4","discoveryContext":"Fieldwalking","parish":"Muker","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Richmondshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/amarshall/BA axe8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"83.19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
