The blade is expanded and strongly curved. The cutting edge is abraded and notched. Each side curves sharply inwards behind the blade before tapering more gently towards the butt. There are traces of a slight raised rib on the butt end of both sides. The surviving portion of the body is rectangular in cross-section with a hole in the centre, which is all that remains of the socket. All surfaces have a shiny green patina, which is missing in a few places. Traces of patination can also been found on the break.\n\n\n\nLength: 63.0mm, width: 44.5mm, thickness: 21.2mm","fourFigureLat":"52.74883504","fourFigureLon":"-1.34959469","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Booth","datefound1":"February 12, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Booth","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whitwick","county":"Leicestershire","district":"North West Leicestershire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/annab/LEIC-9AFF65.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"63"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
