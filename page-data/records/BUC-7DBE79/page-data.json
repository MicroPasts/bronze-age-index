(2017) would suggest this axehead fits classes 3f-4E. Of those illustrated by this text it most closely resembles a class 4c from.&nbsp;The axe is also comparable in form to the Class 4A-Caxes from the Brithdair metalwork assemblage (Rohl and Needham, 1998:123, fig. 24, no.31) and those from the Willerby metalwork assemblage (Rohl and Needham, 1998:125, fig.26, nos. 53, 58).&nbsp; This would place the axe in the period between 2100-1700 BC.&nbsp; Similar examples can be seen on the database:&nbsp;LANCUM-2BBD52, DENO-830FF8 and LANCUM-589F64.","fourFigureLat":"51.82141145","fourFigureLon":"-1.13088987","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"November 29, 2019","datefound2":"November 29, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alexandra Cobby","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.42","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Boarstall","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sashacobby/BUC7DBE79.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"84.16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
