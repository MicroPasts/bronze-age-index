Only the blade end and part of its body survive. The socket aperture is sub rectangular in shape. However, the socket aperture has been broken with one side bent inward, distorting its shape.

One face and both sides of the blade are of a dark brown patina, with areas of light green patina. The other face is of a light green patina (especially towards the blade edge) with dark brown patina in the middle.
