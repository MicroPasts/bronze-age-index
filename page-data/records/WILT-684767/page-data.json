The item consists of a short section of blade, 26.34mm in length, oval in section and 27.98mm in width, tapering over its extant length to 25.71mm.\n\n\n\nThe blade is 6.02mm thick. At the point of the break, the flat of blade appears to be beginning to curl upwards but this might have occurred at the same time as the break rather than being part of the original design.\n\n\n\nIt weighs 22.95g. It has a green patina, but part of the surface on one side has been scored, perhaps when excavated, and shows a silvery colour.","fourFigureLat":"51.30199026","fourFigureLon":"-1.48499642","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Hanbidge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Hanbidge","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Vernhams Dean","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/grace93/IMG_6137.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"26.34"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
