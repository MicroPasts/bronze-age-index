It is max.7.6mm in diameter at the centre, narrowing to c.5mm diameter at either end, both of which show areas of damage. The bead stands 5.3mm in height and weighs 1.91g.\n\n\n\n\nThe bead is of similar form to several of sheet gold reported through the Treasure Act, namely HAMP-72E451 (2011 T526),GLO-46CA05 (2014 T358) and NMS-AEC678 (2013 T20), for the latter of which is written 'The gold bead is likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC) based on several close comparanda. The three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham, hoard are similar in form, size and weight to the Salthouse bead (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts (including bronze palstaves) that allow it to be dated to c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid.). The bead is also similar to those from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire and Harlow, Essex, the former from a stratified Middle Bronze Age context (Varndell 2000, 12, no.1; 2005/6, 17, 270, no.6), and Buriton, Hampshire (HAMP-72E451).\nMiddle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. forthcoming) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).","fourFigureLat":"51.58929397","fourFigureLon":"-1.39514884","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"The age and precious metal content of the bead meet the criteria for Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"March 31, 2014","datefound2":"March 31, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"5.3","diameter":"7.6","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lockinge","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley2/PAS65902F.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
