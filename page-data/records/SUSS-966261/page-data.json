The palstave was broken into two pieces from an old break but the pieces were found within 10 metres of each other and fit together perfectly. The looped palstave measures 166mm in length by 63.6mm (width across cutting edge) by 28.5mm and weighs 449g. The cutting edge is crescentic with a wide edge bevel and is considerably damaged from old breaks. There is a single central linear moulding on both sides of the blade which starts 18.2mm from the cutting edge and ends close to the stop ridge. The stop is squared and the side flanges are high, although one side is more worn that the other. There is a faint casting seam along the centre of the sides of the blade and flange. Behind the stop are three liniar mouldings running from the stop to the butt on both sides. The loop starts level with the stop and is 23.1mm long, the top of it is broken from an old break. The palstave belongs to the Taunton phase of metalworking, dating from c. 1500-1250BC. It has a pale green patina, parts of the surface are pitted and some of the edges are damaged. A similar axe in slightly better condition was recorded as: SOM-1AA9C5.","fourFigureLat":"50.765925","fourFigureLon":"-0.753547","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"December 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pagham","county":"West Sussex","district":"Arun","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lburnett/SUSS-966261.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"166"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
