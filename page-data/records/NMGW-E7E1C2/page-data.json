The butt protrudes beyond the return of the wings (by 14mm) and expands to the end (with a width of 22.4mm and a thickness of 6.1mm). The end of the butt has two 'horns' each side of a central rectangular break, which would have been attached to the casting jet before removal. The sides of the axe are straight and converge slightly towards the start of the blade (where the axe has a maximum body width behind the loop of 27mm and a minimum width at the stop of 21.8mm). The loop is positioned towards the rear of the wings (and has a length of 20.7mm, a height of 8.7mm, giving the axe an overall width of 34.6mm, a thickness of 6mm and an aperture of 7.4mm x 5.3mm). The remains of the casting seams are discernible along both sides. The wings diverge sharply to their apices before returning more gradually to the blade. The wings are only partially turned-over and were unlikely to have been closed (the wings have a maximum height of 36.4mm, a length of 48.7mm and a thickness of 4.7mm). Both the wings on the unlooped side have broken in antiquity (with a surviving height of 23mm) a stress fracture near the blade appears to suggest the wing was struck from the top (as hafted). The stop is rounded and gradually slopes from the septum (where the axe has a maximum body thickness of 18.0mm). The blade is slender and the sides diverge to form a rounded blade edge (with a width of 40.3mm). The blade faces are slightly convex with no discernible blade facet. The original surface of the axe has been lost and has a current pitted bronze surface. The septum has small patches of black patina surviving.\n\n\n\nEnd-winged axes are associated with the Carp's Tongue complex with a distribution centred around northern France and southern Britain. Burgess's (1968) distribution of the axe type is confined to south-eastern England except for one western outlier in St. Kenidjack, Cornwall. Swansea Museum has a (probable) replica end-winged axe recovered from Sketty, Swansea. A Ewart Park hoard recovered in 2005 from Llancarfan, Vale of Glamorgan contained one end-winged axe (Gwilt, 2008, p 221, no. 1223) . This discovery appears to represent the third find of this axe type in Wales and the fourth in western Britain and may suggest a possible local clustering around Swansea, possibly indicating a network of exchange and circulation of metalwork around coastal South Wales.","fourFigureLat":"51.592143","fourFigureLon":"-3.979119","fromdate":"-875","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Steve Sell","datefound1":"January 01, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sketty","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/wing axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"1360.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
