Acton Park II / Taunton phase.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a rounded butt end which extends to a curved cutting edge with splayed crescentic blade.\n\n\n\nTwo integral lateral lozenge shaped flanges are present along either side, rising steadily from the butt, rounding off at the apex midway along the body, before sloping steadily back down to the blade.\n\n\n\nEach tip of the flanges curve slight in toward the body of the axe, though one tip is lost to a worn break. The exterior surfaces of the flanges have been filed smooth leaving no visible casting lines.\n\n\n\nA slight steepening to the profile of the axe is present where the flanges meet the body representing a very slight stop-ridge.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark brown patina with some bubbly green corrosion, possibly signs of bronze disease. The axehead is 106.5mm long, 45.9mm wide at the blade, 25.3mm wide at the butt end, 27.9mm thick at the widest point of the flanges, 13.3mm thick at the widest point of the main body and weighs 188g.","fourFigureLat":"54.16394138","fourFigureLon":"-0.71496725","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rillington","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/DR0158.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"106.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
