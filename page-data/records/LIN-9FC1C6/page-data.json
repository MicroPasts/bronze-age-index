The blade is made of copper alloy and now has a red-brown patina covering the entire surface, including the breaks. The fragment is lozenge-shaped in section but both of the 'edges' are worn and irregular.A clear apex runs down the centre of the blade on both sides. The fragment is slightly curved in section, suggesting that it was bent before having been broken. Both of the breaks are relatively straight, though somewhat worn, and this might suggest that the object was carefully cut into pieces in antiquity.\n\n\n\nLength: 22.96mm, width and thickness at one end 12.14mm and 2.98mm respectively; at the other end 12.01mm and 2.77mm respectively.Weight 3.26g.","fourFigureLat":"53.25099258","fourFigureLon":"-0.30780794","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"January 28, 2015","datefound2":"January 28, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.98","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Apley","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN9FC1C6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"22.96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
