The upper face of the jet is sub-oval (37.8mm x 23.9mm) and has an undulating surface, as cast. The sides of the jet are divergent (to 12mm below the surface) before becoming more parallel sided (15.4mm thick). One of the runners is significantly larger than the other (18mm x 12mm compared to 9mm x 5mm) but both are similar lengths before being cut (14mm long). The surface is corroded with a pale-green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe two-runner jet is comparatively substantial, perhaps suggesting its use in casting a larger object, perhaps an axe or sword.","fourFigureLat":"51.81217814","fourFigureLon":"-2.90075137","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantilio Crossenny","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2019413.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
