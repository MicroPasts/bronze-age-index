The edge opposite the terminal has a cross-section measuring 6.6x5.6mm. A paler gold strip or wire (possibly silvery-gold with traces of tarnishing) winds around the brighter gold surface of the object to give striped bands of equal size, c. 1mm wide.\n\nThe object measures 17.0mm in length, 15.7mm in width, 6.6mm in max.thickness (the side opposite the terminal) and weighs 9.06g.","fourFigureLat":"50.97913101","fourFigureLon":"-1.74497443","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"'The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008).
