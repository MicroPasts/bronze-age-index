The blade has a wide cresent shaped cutting edge that is corroded and chipped with no evidence of the original sharp edge. There is a triangular shaped recess below the stop ridge (blade end) on one side, while corrosion obscures this on the other side. The stop ridge is rectangular in plan, and diamond shaped in profile. There is an old break at the butt end. Casting scars are found down the length of both sides. Mainly dark green in colour with lighter green pitting caused by corrosion. The original polished dark brown patina is only seen in the sockets.","fourFigureLat":"51.253616","fourFigureLon":"1.079678","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Richardson","datefound1":"August 20, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Richardson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.49","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Kent","district":"Canterbury","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/arichardson/PAK150-002.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"142.62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
