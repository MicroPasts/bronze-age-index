The axehead is wedge-shaped with a square socket at the haft end. Internally the socket tapers and narrows from the mouth to the cutting edge. Externally the axehead expands gently along the body before a very slightly wider flare to the curved but now damaged cutting edge. There is a wide circumferential raised mouth moulding at the socket, with a second much narrower moulding below. To one side of the mouth, just below the wide moulding and interrupting the narrower ridge, a side loop is present with D-shaped cross-section. Casting flashes remain on both sides of the axehead, including on the loop. Both faces of the axehead are decorated with three long narrow ribs, similar in dimensions to the narrower mouth moulding. Much of the surface of the axehead is missing, including the ends of all six ribs.","fourFigureLat":"51.1498912","fourFigureLon":"0.91545159","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-600","notes":"\nFinder/recorder name obfuscated and shown as Kent FLO for site security\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"October 17, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"43","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wye with Hinxhill","county":"Kent","district":"Ashford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/PUBLICCEED5D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"116"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
