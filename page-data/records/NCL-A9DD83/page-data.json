The mouth of the axe is subsquare and there is a double mouth moulding. Around the mouth of the axe there are sprues. The body of the axe is rectangular, with straight sides, which then flare into the lower blade slightly expanded cutting edge. The cutting edge is intact and there are slight marks along the blade edge where it has been resharpened. The axe has a triangular profile. The side loop is semicircular with a semicircular perforation. A prominent casting seam runs down either side of the axe as far as the mid point. It is particularly prominent above the loop. The original surface of the axe partially survives with a dark green to black patina, worn and pitted in places. The axehead measures 87mm in length, the blade has a width of 40mm, the mouth 33mm.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philippa Walton","datefound1":"May 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philippa Walton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"33","discoveryContext":"Building work","parish":"Duxford","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"South Cambridgeshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pwalton/ridleyaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
