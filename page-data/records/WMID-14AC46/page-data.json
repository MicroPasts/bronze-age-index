This rounded tip has a very blunted and possibly unfinished blade and only a small part of the bottom of the socket mouth is visible as a slight sub-rectangular indentation.  This artefact is in a worn and poor condition with a patchy dark brown patina remaining, although the object seems to have been coated in a substance.\n\nIn 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age', savory states that the socketed axe-head represents a change both in the method of hafting and the method of production.  This involves the adoption of a handle with a single knee-shaft prong, as well as the use of hollow casting and the 'cire perdue' process.","fourFigureLat":"52.660686","fourFigureLon":"-2.090144","fromdate":"-1050","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"May 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Saredon","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-14AC46.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"24.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
