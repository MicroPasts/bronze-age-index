The object is much worn and so it is difficult to identify with any certainty. It is possibly a tanged arrowhead or possibly a razor. Only the tang and a small section of the body of the blade remains (although it is just possible that the projection is not a tang and may be the result of accidental wear). Alternative object types may possibly be a chisel or gouge.  The object appears to have been symmetrical, tapering gradually towards the edges, making it lozenge shaped in section. The object expands from the tang into the blade at an angle of approximately 40 degrees. The tang measures approximately 19.1 mm long and the blade 15.9 mm long. It measures 35 mm long in total. It is 16.1 mm wide and 4.36 mm thick. It weighs 5.2 grams. It has a predominantly dark green to brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.328047","fourFigureLon":"-2.104138","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"February 22, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.36","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dodford with Grafton","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Bromsgrove","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-94A053.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
