The remains of the object consist of the blade edge and part of the body, which terminates in an uneven worn break leaving part of the socketed interior visible. The break is slightly higher on one side of the axehead than the other, thus the tapered sides of the body of the axehead are visible. The blade edge is curved but very worn and chipped. The axehead has a thick dark reddish brown patina in patches across its surface (c. 30%), however much of this has been chipped and abraded away revealing a brown patina underneath. It is not possible to identify whether the axe has been sharpened or whether a casting seam existed due to most of its patina being chipped away. \n\n\n\nThe lack of diagnostic features from this axehead fragment prevents a more exact type or parallel for its form being cited, however socketed axeheads are believed to date from the Middle Bronze Age (c.1300 BC) to the Earliest Iron Age (c.700/600 BC).\n\n\n\nThe overall dimensions are as follows: 68.25mm in length, 38.39mm in width, 14.23mm in thickness and 47.73g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"52.355048","fourFigureLon":"-2.060154","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford","datefound1":"September 15, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.23","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sidemoor","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Bromsgrove","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sburford/WAW71FAB4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"68.25"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
