One face appears to exhibit a shield-shaped depression on the blade below the stop-ridge. It is now difficult to determine the original width of the blade edge, height of the stop ridge and flanges or length of the butt. However, it is unlikely the flanges rose much above the height of the stop, suggesting it was a low-flanged form, and the surviving blade seems to have been broad. Casting flashes are discernible on one of the sides.","fourFigureLat":"51.600111","fourFigureLon":"-3.430773","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"The suggestion of low flanges, as well as the combination of a sunken shield pattern with a raised midrib, means this is probably a Gr.III, Type Wantage palstave (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 133-5). This type of palstave held its currency in the Taunton phase (c.1400-1275 BC), though may have also extended into the Penard phase (up to c.1100 BC).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Porth","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn0848.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"118"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
