The cutting edge has been lost. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade (measured from the blade edge to the stop ridge) is 80.56 mm long and the width of blade at its widest point is 63.21 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 8.56 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 24.25 mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 32.5 mm). Directly below the stop ridge are two concave depressions which are bordered by slightly raised ridges. This pattern is more visible on one face than the other. The convex cutting edge of the blade is lost through corrosion, abrasion and probably wear. Although evidence of the blade facet remains on both sides of the object The exposed edge is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This may be due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion or be functional use in the active Bronze Age life of the palstave. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 69.94 mm long, 17.6 mm wide and 6.1 mm thick. The butt of the axe is complete. The width at the butt is 28.4 mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ slightly from one another. However, one face of the axe has been severally damaged by abrasion and corrosion which renders comparison between the two faces difficult. Below the stop ridge on one face there is a u-shaped hollow section which is cast into the object. It measures 28.5 mm long and 24.1 mm wide. It is better preserved on one side than the other probably due to movement or corrosion whilst within the plough soil.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid green colour with areas of thick well formed patina and exposed areas of abraded metal. It is likely that abrasion and corrosion has spread and affected 40% of the surface of the axe. However, this corrosion seems to be relatively stable at present and relatively few areas of light green active powdery corrosion can be observed. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in: Savory, 1980; Catalogue of the Bronze Age collections in the National Museum of Wales; entry 153 from St Fagans, Glamorgan. This form and style of palstave fits can be classifided as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC specifically within the  Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. A close comparison to this palstave has been recorded from the Albrighton Area, Shropshire (HESH-D05FE3)\n\n\n\nThe palsatve measures 149 mm long and weighs 494.1 grams.","fourFigureLat":"53.11012579","fourFigureLon":"-2.12096067","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"September 08, 2014","datefound2":"September 08, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24.25","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Horton","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Staffordshire Moorlands","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMID-755304.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"149"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
