In cross section the mid rib is lozenge shaped with a maximum thickness of 7.5mm. to either side of the mid rib are two smaller and subtler ridges probably indicating the presence of channels along much of the blade.\n\n\n\nThe spear head is covered in a thick dark green copper patina that is chipped/abraded in parts. underneath this patina the object is light green. The blade is mostly well preserved but has several chip along both edges these are not as patinated such that these chips look to have occurred after its deposition.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is narrow being 57.84m in length with a maximum width at its break of 15.8mm. It weighs 12.08 grams.\n\n\n\nAs this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).\n\n\n\nSimilar objects include: NLM-99D791, IOW-F3883D, SUR-BB2595","fourFigureLat":"51.18618583","fourFigureLon":"-1.90122401","fromdate":"1200","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"June 17, 2018","datefound2":"September 17, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shrewton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOMDD8385.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"57.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
