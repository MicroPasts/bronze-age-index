Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, plate 36, no.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork, and an ingot fragment from Churston Ferrers, Torbay on page 457, plate 40, no.306a, which are parts of larger plano-convex ingots.","fourFigureLat":"50.12459427","fourFigureLon":"-5.55500287","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"Results of XRF analysis by Dr. Jens Andersen at Camborne School of Mines:\n\n\n\n65% copper (but probably quite pure as 30% of the reading were recorded as anomalies which include gasses and not inclusions)\n\n\n\n7.36% iron\n\n\n\n0.16% antimony\n\n\n\n0.04% zinc\n\n\n\n0.03% tin\n\n\n\nThis is typical of readings taken from other individual Late Bronze Age ingots and also those in the hoards mentioned above.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"November 01, 2008","datefound2":"November 30, 2008","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"36","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"36","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penzance","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Sep16finds041.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"72"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
