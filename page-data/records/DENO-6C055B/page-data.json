Overall, the spearhead measures 50.7mm long, 24.5mm wide and 19.9mm thick. It weighs 24.20g.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is small (stumpy). It has a short kite-shaped blade measuring 37.3mm long. The edges of the blade expand to a maximum of 5.1mm away from the midrib. The midrib extends to the tip of the blade. The midrib contains the socket for the spear's shaft, which is conical and expands rapidly towards the socket opening. The socket measures 35mm in depth and the opening has an external diameter of 22.9mm and an internal diameter 19.5mm. No organic material survives in the socket.\n\n\n\nBelow the blade there are four circular perforations through the rim of the socket, one on each side. Three of these are incomplete due to the broken rim of the socket. These perforations would have held pegs for holding the spearhead on the shaft. Normally pegged spearheads have only one or two holes which are aligned below the blade edges. The two holes aligned with the blade edges are both incomplete and have damaged edges coverd with pale corrosion product. The other two have much neater edges - the complete hole is a almost a perfect circle - with the same patination as the rest of the object. Drilled holes on similar spearheads tend to be quite rough so the neater holes may have been cast rather than drilled. \n\n\n\nAn example of a similar pegged spearhead on the database is LVPL-D726F2.\n\n\n\nRichard Davis says: These types of spearhead are normally found in hoards and are normally found in the Southeast. Besides the other example on the database, 58 spearheads of this type have been found in Britain. Five were found in hoard in Pembrokeshire, but most have been found in East Anglia around the edge of the Fenn or in the upper Thames Valley. Also 22 of them were found in the Blackmoor Hoard in Hampshire. This find suggests that there were links between the Trent Valley and the Southeast and that there was influence in Nottinghamshire area from the Southeast.\n\n\n\nColquhoun, I., 1979 'The Late Bronze Age Hoard from Blackmoor, Hampshire', in C.
