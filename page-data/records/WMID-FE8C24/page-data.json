In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 96.18 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 56.31 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 3.33 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 17.36mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 29.15 mm).\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 65.75 mm long, 16.03 mm wide, and 6.73 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving two rounded corners with a gap between. The butt is 25.13 mm wide and 5.54 mm thick. \n\n\nThe flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by. \n\n\nIn total the palstave measures 166 mm in length, 56.54 mm wide (maximum) and 36.48 mm thick. It weighs 471.1 g.\n\n\nSeveral casting flaws in the form of air bubbles are present on the septum. The poor quality of the casting is confirmed by an xray of the palstave which demostrated several large air bubbles within the internal structure of the palstave. XRF (X Ray Fluorescence) of the surface corrosion indicates that the palstave has a composition of 76.24% Copper (Cu), 14.62% Tin (Sn), 0.48% Lead (Pb) and 0.41% Iron (Fe).\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface. The palstave has been kindly cleaned stabilised by Aimee Sims (Conservation Department, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery).\n\n\nSimilar examples to this palstave can be seen in Savory, 1980; catalogue entries 171, 172, 175, and 263 (the Mynydd Ta-y-glannau, Cemmaes Hoard). All of these examples fit into the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II).\n\n\nReference:\n\nSavory, H. N., 1980.
