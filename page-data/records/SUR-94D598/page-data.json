It was probably part of the Acton Park or Taunton metalwork assemblages. The axe is in very good condition with a bright blue/green patina. The axe measures 101.75mm in length and the blade is 42.25mm across. The length of the septum and socket is 54.85mm. The width across the possible loop is 22.99mm. The weight is 193g. All surfaces, especially the edges, appear worn and very smooth. The casting seams are smooth and the decoration of three short/curved(?) ribs is almost obliterated. There may have been a miscast loop on one of the sides; what is left is a slight, now flattened and abraded bulge in the casting seam. The blade is short and roughly triangular; it appears small for a palstave of this size, but the wear on the surfaces and along the edges suggests that this palstave was of age when deposited or lost, so it may well have been in use for a long time and repeatedly sharpened which would explain the small size of the blade.","fourFigureLat":"51.60712326","fourFigureLon":"-1.3660316","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"September 12, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26.55","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Hendred","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF4043.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"101.75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
