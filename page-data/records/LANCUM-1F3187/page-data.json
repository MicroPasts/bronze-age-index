It curves around a little over 180 degrees to form a hook which measures in total c. 42mm long by 24mm wide. The tip is pointed and has no barb; there is no hole or eye for attachment at the blunt end.\n\n\n\nThis object is strikingly similar to an object known as a fish hook, now in the British Museum (1989,0601.225), which was apparently found in the 'Batheaston' hoard of Bronze Age and Iron Age objects. The hoard was not recorded at the time of discovery, and was then dispersed by sale; the findspot is thought to be either Batheaston, near Bath, or Wylye, Wiltshire.\n\n\n\nBecause of the possibility that this object was a prehistoric fish hook, it was given an XRF analysis to determine the composition of its surface. This gave a result of 99.99 % copper and 0.01 % arsenic, which is unfortunately not diagnostic of any particular date.\n\n\n\nIt is large for a fish hook, and pure copper, being relatively soft, is perhaps not the best material for a hook intended to catch large, powerful fish. It may alternatively be a pin.","fourFigureLat":"54.16783577","fourFigureLon":"-2.84393369","fromdate":"-2400","todate":"-450","notes":"\nThanks to Dr Neil Wilkin (British Museum) for opinions given on an image of this object.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"April 13, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Silverdale","county":"Lancashire","district":"Lancaster","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM-1F3187-1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"40"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
