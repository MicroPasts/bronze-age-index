The break has occurred in antiquity and the axe is of sub-rectangular section at the break (with a width of 34mm and a thickness of 11.1mm). The sides are somewhat straight and divergent (for 20mm) before flaring outwards to the blade tips to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 52.4mm). Any casting seams on the sides are no longer evident, probably masked by corrosion and surface loss. The original blade edge has been lost and the blade edge is now asymmetric, differentially worn on one side and has a comparatively deep curve.  The blade faces appear moderately flat before converging to the edge, with a possible subtle blade facet (16mm from the edge). There is a prominent mid-ridge evident on both faces but more noticeable on the better preserved face. It is possible that the mid-ridge may be the distal end of a midrib but may also have had a consistent ridge along the length of the blade. The surface is partially preserved on one face with a dark-green to brown patina and has been lost on the other. There are a number of scratches or striations on the area of preserved surface and appear to be beneath the patina. \n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification difficult, the central blade ridge suggests an axe of Developed Type or palstave blade, suggesting a the axe belonged to Arreton tradition at the earliest, dated from c. 1700BC to and probably through to Wilburton at the latest, c. 1000BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.7366159","fourFigureLon":"-3.29025869","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Darran Valley","county":"Caerphilly","district":"Caerphilly","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017150new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"47.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
