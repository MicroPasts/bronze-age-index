The object is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is missing due to an old and abraded break however the retained portion tapers inward toward the butt end. The retained portion of the body of the object has a diagonal break, possibly cause post-depositionally.   \n\n\n\nThe metal is brown in colour with areas of light green corrosion. The object has a pitted patina.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. \n\n\n\nNeedham, S. (1996) Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age.
