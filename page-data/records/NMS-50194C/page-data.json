It is a solid and heavy bar with four long narrow faces, one of which is divided into two gently sloping facets by a central longitudinal ridge, which may be a casting seam. The end faces and the cross-sectional form are pentagonal, but nearly square: the three unfaceted sides are at approximately right-angles to each other and of similar widths. All faces and facets are generally flat (even the sloping ones). Both ends of the bar splay slightly on all sides, suggesting that they may have been subject to a compressive hammering force.\n\n\n\nOne of the two sloping facets is raised a little higher than its counterpart. That is to say it slopes directly from the ridge, whereas the latter steps down a fraction of a millimetre before sloping away. This is most obvious at the centre of the ridge; the difference in level gradually diminishes towards the ends until it is imperceptible, perhaps because of the hammering. The higher facet is additionally distinguished from the other facet and all the other faces in that its surface is completely covered in fine grooves, which appear to be file-marks. It also has a single oblique ridge running across it, not centrally, which looks like another casting seam. The file marks on the shorter side of the oblique ridge are finer and equally oblique. Those on the long side are coarser and transverse. Close inspection of the file marks reveals the coarser ones to be composed of two rows of opposed and interspersing long and narrow triangular ridges, with a zig-zag groove running between them. The finer marks are continuous (unbroken from side to side) and near parallel grooves and ridges. There are further fine transverse and oblique file marks visible here and there alongside one of the long edges on the face directly opposite the ridged face.\n\n\n\nThere are some scratches on one of the other long faces that appear accidental. The patina on all surfaces is dark green. There is no evidence of any breaks.\n\n\n\nLength: 89.2mm. Width: 23.5mm. Thickness: 20.0mm.
