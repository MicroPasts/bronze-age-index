The butt was trapezoidal (with a maximum surviving width of 45.5mm) without a central rib or notches. The butt appears to have broken through two rivet holes, positioned near the upper edge and is thinnest at the top edge (0.5mm) tapering towards the blade (2.7mm thick before the blade). The shoulders slope towards the triangular blade (with a width beneath the shoulders of 26mm). The blade is of rounded, low-oval section (with a maximum thickness of 3.2mm near the butt) with no discernible mid-rib and with straight sides. Concave blade facets (with a surviving width of 4.8mm) are evident and the blade edges have been lost. The dirk has none of the original surface surviving and has a green to orange-brown surface colour.","fourFigureLat":"51.573927","fourFigureLon":"-3.992758","fromdate":"-1275","todate":"-1120","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mumbles","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.167.1.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"159"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
