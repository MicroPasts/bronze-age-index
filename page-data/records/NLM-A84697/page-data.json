Cast U-shaped plate with a cutting edge which runs along one long edge and continuing along the short straight side; the other long side and the U shaped end are flattened. The section is of extremely flattened lentoid form, a point which is only apparent if it is viewed against a straight edge.This object was initially considered as a sword blade fragment, but it lacks any convincing strengthening of the middle part of the blade, and a single sided form would be unusual for a rapier. This object appears to have been robustly cleaned by the finder.
