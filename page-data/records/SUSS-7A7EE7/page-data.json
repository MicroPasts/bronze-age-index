It is widest at 5.43mm approximately 1/3 along its length, the shorter side narrowing to a circular cross-section and terminating in a sharp point. The longer side maintains its rectangular cross-section and curves slightly downwards, although this may be due to damage rather than design. The shorter, rounded section appears much more worn suggesting that the rectangular sectioned element may have been a tang for a handle . The surface is undecorated and has a mid-green patina.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length, 57.45mm; width, 5.92mm; thickness, 5.48mm and weight: 6.79g\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Plain copper alloy awls are hard to date precisely but examples of this form are thought to have been introduced in the Bronze Age (2150-800 BC) with most being Late Bronze Age in date (1150-800 BC). Other recorded examples include: NMS-12EC04; LEIC-711C38 and SUR-CB591E.","fourFigureLat":"51.1738863","fourFigureLon":"-1.11450615","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.48","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bradley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS7A7EE7a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"57.45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
