The fragment consists of most of the blade-end of the axehead, which is socketed to approximately 21 mm deep within the fragment. Most of the surface of the axehead has worn away from severe surface abrasion with only small areas of the outer surface remaining; all remaining outer surfaces are medium-green in colour and patina. The interior colouration of the metal is of a lighter green colour and powdery in texture. The fragment measures 38.5 mm long, 31.21 mm wide (at blade-end), 23.11 mm wide (at broken end), 3.35 mm thick (blade-end), 16.71 mm thick (at broke end) ; it weighs 34.54 grams.","fourFigureLat":"50.86143362","fourFigureLon":"-0.4668154","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-801","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"March 01, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stephanie Smith","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Patching","county":"West Sussex","district":"Arun","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSSDF84CF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"38.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
