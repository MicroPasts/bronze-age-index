The axe is comparatively small with an overall length of 59.50mm and a weight of 62.4g. The incomplete mouth would have been sub-rectangular (36.32mm x 25.3mm). The remnants of the three casting stubs are evident on the three remaining sides of the mouth, demonstrating the axe was produced using four-runner casting technology. The socket has a depth of 39.5mm. The cornice-like mouth moulding or collar has a length of 7.5mm. The slender loop springs from beneath the base of the collar. The sides are straight and diverge slightly before the blade to produce a slightly expanded blade edge. The remnants of the casting flashes are prominent on the sides, and have been finished, probably by hammering. The sides are slightly bevelled towards the centre, producing a slightly hexagonal body profile. The blade edge is poorly preserved and has a width of 38.05mm. Both faces were decorated with three ribs, beginning at the base of the collar and continuing for c. 30mm. The ribs are convergent on the holed face and appear to be parallel on the face with the damaged mouth. The sides of the faces are pronounced suggesting additional ribs. Light sharpening striations are discernible running perpendicular to the blade edge. The surface of the axe is well preserved and has a mid-brown patina. Orange discolouration around the loop is likely to be the result of mineral staining. The damage to the axe is not consistent with its use and does not appear to be the result of casting problems. There is the suggestion that the holed face bows outwards at the base of the hole and that the other face may bend in slightly, perhaps suggesting a sharp implement was forced through both faces.","fourFigureLat":"51.540895","fourFigureLon":"-3.082838","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Marshfield","county":"Newport","district":"Newport","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006110.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"59.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
