The ring is circular in plan sub-circular in section. The inside of the ring has what appears to be file marks or possibly scratches resulting from use, however these markings do not cover the entire inner surface. A couple of sections are smooth like the outside, which may suggest the presence of a strap. One area of the ring is slightly thinner than the rest; again a possible indication of use. The ring is undecorated but it has a beautiful green-brown patina which, when compared to other typologically and chronologically distinctive artefacts from the same area, suggests a Bronze Age or Iron Age date. It has an internal diameter of 27.6mm.\n\n\n\nSimilar rings have been discovered in a number of Bronze Age hoards and have been suggested to be horse harness fittings, part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron (Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg types; Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g), or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire. Several are recorded on the PAS database although dates vary: NLM-56D148 and  WAW-0255D3 (Roman), SUR-EDE94A and LANCUM-5BFE21 (Iron Age).","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"43","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"38.1","edge":null,"thickness":"4.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2019162.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
