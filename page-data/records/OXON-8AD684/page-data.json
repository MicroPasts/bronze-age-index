The blade is vesica (pointed oval) shape in cross section with a sligthly flattened midrib from which it narrows more sharply to an edge that now has many chips along it.\n\n\n\nThe surviving portion of the hilt is oval in plan but its unlikely to represent its original from. It is divided from the blade by two narrow contractions.\n\n\n\nThe object has a medium green patina.\n\n\n\nThe fragment of the object is 67mm long, 19.3mm wide, and is 4.0mm thick. It weighs 26.42 grams.\n\n\n\nWithout the entirety of the blade the type of weapon must be general. It can be classed as one of Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group IV: Notched butt weapons with reworked butts, e.g. Nos. 898-950 (Burgess and Gerloff 1981: Plate 110) although other type II and type IV rapiers show modification to become similar to this example. These probably date slightly later than the original weapons, so a date in the later Middle Bronze Age or earlier Late Bronze Age seem feasible. Similar examples exist on the database such as.
