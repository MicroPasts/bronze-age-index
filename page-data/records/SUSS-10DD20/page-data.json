The sides of the blade expand slightly at the rounded tip. It is lenticular in cross section with a central mid rib and the blade is thinner in section on the upper part of the blade. The faces of the blade are plain and the edges worn and irregular. The blade is bent with a short narrow indentation across the mid rib on one face.  The object has a dark green patina.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: length = 30.20mm; width = 13.08mm widening at the rounded tip to13.89mm; thickness = 4.1mm narrowing to 1.3mm at the tip and weight = 5.74g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: this is most probably the tip of a rapier or dirk fragment.  The bend in the blade is possibly a deliberate act to render the object unusable.","fourFigureLat":"51.10429763","fourFigureLon":"-1.51576098","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"April 28, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Houghton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS10DD20a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"30.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
