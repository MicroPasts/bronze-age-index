It is 105.9mm in length. The blade is 42.1mm from tip to tip and is 60.0mm in length. The palstave has a wide blade, with a single medial raised rib running down the centre on both faces. The blade starts parallel at the top and then expands progressively towards the convex cutting edge. The cutting edge and tips are all badly worn and corroded. The tips proper have almost certainly been removed due to this wear. The butt end of the axe is roughly rectangular in section with prominent flanges on either face. The butt end is otherwise undecorated. Casting lines can still be seen on both flange sides. For similar example see Norfolk Museum Service (1977) Bronze Age Metalwork, fig 13.","fourFigureLat":"51.284324","fourFigureLon":"0.551066","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jennifer Jackson","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Jennifer Jackson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Boxley","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jjackson/cumminsaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"105.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
