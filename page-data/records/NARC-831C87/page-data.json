The ring is penannular with one slightly pointed end. It was possibly used as an ear ring, although there are a number of other uses for such artefact types. One such use might be a link in a chain. A similar artefact is illustrated in Crummy (1983, 50; 1796) which is cited as being a possible Roman ear ring. However other penannular rings of a not dissimilar nature make up links from a possible chain mesh purse (Crummy 1983, 50; 1850). A definite function for such items is thus difficult to ascertain, and when discovered outside a stratified context determining a date is likewise problematic. They may date from as early as the Bronze Age, whilst they may be as late as post-medieval.","fourFigureLat":"52.29327","fourFigureLon":"-0.637814","fromdate":"2000","todate":"1700","notes":"A further ring, similar in form although larger was found in the same area.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"March 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rushden","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"East Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-831C87ring.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
