BC 1500 to c. BC 1150.\n\n\n\nThe object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There is damage to both edges of the blade.\n\n\n\nIt measures 37.2 mm in length, 12.5 mm wide (base), 7.2 mm wide (tip) and 6.6 mm thick. It weighs 7.7 g.\n\n\n\nThe spear head is a mid green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. This object has lost most of it's diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult. However similar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including SWYOR-1F74C1, SF-C557DC and WMID-270D2F. All have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"52.67787579","fourFigureLon":"-1.55771883","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"May 18, 2019","datefound2":"May 18, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Appleby Magna","county":"Leicestershire","district":"North West Leicestershire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID95EB72.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"37.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
