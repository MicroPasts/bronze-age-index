The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On both faces of the blade there is a feint single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The surface of the blade has only small patches of a dark brown patina, mainly within the hollows, otherwise the surface is pitted. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion, but appears to be slightly asymmetrical. The blade facet is 11.62mm wide. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam. There is a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. Before the stop ridge, on both faces, there is a small shield-shaped/pattern decoration. The flange sides are a sub triangle in profile with casting seams, and are incomplete. One side, at the junction of the blade and stop there is an incomplete, integral loop which has a sub-lozenge section. The void is a sub semi-circle. In plan the septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, whose butt is rectangular with rounded corners. On one face of the butt terminal there are two large air holes visible. The palstave measures 159.16mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.90mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 29.16mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 398g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group III type which has a mid rib decoration. Dot Broughton comments that 'shield-pattern below the stop ridge is small compared to others'. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments that the palstave '...fits within Acton Park II or Taunton metalworking assemblage.' Therefore this can be classified further as fitting within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII. Similar axes are illustrated in Savoury (1980), Figure 22, Nos. 162 and 164.\n\n\n\nSavory, H.N. 1980 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections National Museum of Wales, Cardiff","fourFigureLat":"52.7140283","fourFigureLon":"-2.38631036","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"April 05, 2015","datefound2":"May 31, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sheriffhales","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWB8887E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"159.16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
