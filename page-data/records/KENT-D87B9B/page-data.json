The object has been broken in to two peices by an old break as has the butt. The palstave is unlooped with narrow flanges fused to the stop ridge. The width at the butt is 19.2mm. The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt and a parallel in height to the septum. The stop ridge is plain and no decoration on the blade. The blade widens in width forming triangular tips. The blade is broken by an old break before the cresentric cutting edge; it is 48.7mm wide at its widest point. The surface is worn and pitted, revealing small patches of a smooth dark green patina, particularly on the blade. Together the two parts of the palstave together measure 141.19mm long and weighs 300 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.12259338","fourFigureLon":"0.92802405","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jennifer Jackson","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jennifer Jackson","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mersham","county":"Kent","district":"Ashford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jjackson/KENTD87B9B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"141.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
