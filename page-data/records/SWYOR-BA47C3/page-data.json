It consists of a tapering, hollow shaft, broken at both ends, two flattened, lozenge-shaped side loops, and two short sections of the blade, most of which is missing. It is probable that the blade was leaf-shaped. What remains of the spearhead corresponds with Davis Groups 5 or 6. Davis (2017) notes that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly. The mid rib is D-shaped in section on one face and triangular in section on the other, probably as a result of a slight deformity in the casting mould. The spearhead has a dark green patina. It is 57.9mm long, 36.5mm wide and 17.7mm thick. It weighs 56.36gm.","fourFigureLat":"53.488853","fourFigureLon":"-0.629955","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"September 04, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to the Scheme for educational use","recorder":"Jack Coulthard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Scotter","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1249_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"57.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
