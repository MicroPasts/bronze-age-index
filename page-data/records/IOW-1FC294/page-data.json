The cutting edge measures 46mm wide and has a thickness of 3mm and has a shallow edge bevel measuring 10mm in width. The cutting edge is blunt and abraded and is slightly asymmetrical. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the thickest section being at the stop ridge. The blade appears undecorated with either a mid-rib or shield pattern, however the surface is heavily corroded which may be obscuring any decorative details.\n\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section. The stop ridge is the widest section and measures 20mm in width and 29mm thick. The septum is U-shaped septum and has straight-sided open flanges for hafting. An air bubble is present at the base of the stop ridge on one of the septum faces. The septum measures 40mm in length. Either side of the septum, the flanges are incomplete, thin and abraded. The butt of the object appears complete and measures 16mm in width and 3mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has a bright green patina and lightly corroded and pitted surface.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"1500","todate":"1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lewis Ferrero","datefound1":"August 24, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lewis Ferrero","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"66","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lewisf/IOW1FC294.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"155"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
