From the flat butt of this palstave there is an expanded flange on each side that extend 70mm down the length towards the cutting edge. In between the two flanges is a flat groove 'septum' with a stop ridge across the width where the ends of the prongs of the wooden handle would rest to haft the palstave to the handle. The stop ridge prevents the butt of the palstave from splitting the handle. Just below the stop ridge at the top of the blade is a semi-circular ridge with central double ribs forming a 'shield-pattern'. The blade then expands to the curved cutting edge which is bevelled for sharpness. The copper alloy has a rough mid-pale green patina; there is some surface and edge damage. This palstave is very similar to examples from the \"Acton Park\" axe-industry that emerged at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age in north Wales (Savory 1980:45-6). Dimensions: length: 165.68mm; width of cutting edge: 64.01mm; thickness: 27.25mm; weight: 400.36g. Reference: Savory, H. N. 1980. Guide Catalogue of Bronze Age Collections.
