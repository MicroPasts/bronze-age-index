The blade ends expands to a short cutting edge. The mouth of the axehead is fairly worn but appears to be poorly finished with casting flash seam lines still prominent along the sides and continuing down the body of the axehead towards the blade edge. The mouth moulding / collar around the mouth is swollen with a prominent bulbous or convex external ridge. Beneath this is a slight transverse moulded rib which extends across both faces and sides and is aligned with the upper edge of the side loop. The side loop is relatively small and wide being set in a tight position beneath the collar in line with this horizontal rib. The loop is D shaped in cross section.\n\n\n\nOn the front and rear faces of the axe, six parallel longitudinal ribs descend from the lower edge horizontal rib. The ribs are complete on one side and terminate in blunt points halfway along thebody. One wide face near the socket is incomplete having been broken in antiquity. The external edges of the axe are also slightly raised giving the impression of six descending ribs. The cutting edge is also straight and may have been heavily reworked. Overall the axehead has a mid-green patina towards the blade and dark grey-green towards the socket particularly on the sides. Most damage seems to have been heavily patinated indicating it occurred in antiquity. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: 100.82mm long, 43.75mm wide (including loop, collared mouth 39.53mm wide), 27.3mm thick and 178.88g in weight. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: The axehead dates to the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age 950 - 750 BC and due to the straight sides the date range may also fit with Bronze - Iron Age transition period known as Llyn Fawr which extends the date range to c. 650 BC. Needham (1996) period 7-8 Metalworking stage XII - XIII.  The form roughly fits the South-Eastern types illustrated in Schmidt & Burgess (1981). However the ribbed decoration, a feature of the later types of socketed axehead mark it out as a ribbed variant. See: PUBLIC-CEED5D for a similar type.","fourFigureLat":"51.19550078","fourFigureLon":"1.23327042","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eythorne","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTFBF4F5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"100.82"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
