A small, crudely made and uneven axe with gently sloping sides to the blade.  The blade is not flanged.  The artefact has a high metallic content and would have been made in an open mould (possibly of sandstone), therefore explaining why the surface is no uneven and slightly pitted.  The butt of the axe has tapered to a narrow point but the side is thick.  The axe is worn and in a poor condition.\n\nSimilar examples are illustrated in Peter Harbison's 'The Axes of the Early Bronze Age in Ireland', 1969, particularly those of the Logh Ravel type (pages 10-19).\n\nFlat axes date to the Early Bronze Age, between 2,500-1,450 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.812911","fourFigureLon":"-2.387187","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-1450","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"October 05, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chetwynd","county":"Telford and Wrekin","district":"Telford and Wrekin","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-645353  2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"74.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
