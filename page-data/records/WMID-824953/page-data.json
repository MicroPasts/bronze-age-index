Only the tip of the blade and a small portion of the body of the axehead survive. No traces of a socket remain in the break of the axe, indicating that it is probably not a socketed axe from the later Bronze Age. The blade is flared and slightly crescent shaped, perhaps suggesting that the axehead is either a flanged or palstave type of middle Bronze Age date, which would provide a date range of between circa 1900 to 1100 BC.\n\n\nThe incomplete axehead measures 48 mm long, 44.82 mm wide at the blade, 29.32 mm wide at the broken end, 10.95 mm thick and it weighs 96.1 grams. It has a rough and abraded green/brown patina. The relative consistency between the patina at the break and that on the surface of the axhead suggests that the break is an ancient one, and not one caused recently by plough damage.","fourFigureLat":"52.801635","fourFigureLon":"-2.832069","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"October 22, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Baschurch","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-824953.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"48"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
