The fragment has a surviving blade width of 37.2mm and the break is likely to have been near the blade tip. The surviving blade tip is slightly out-turned. The blade edge is curved and no sharpening striations are evident on the blade. The blade appears to have a casting flaw near the break where the blade has a rounded step across its thickness. The break has no evidence of the bottom of a socket. The surviving side is straight before the out-turn at the tip, and is rounded across its thickness with no evidence of the casting flashes surviving. One face has a more pronounced blade facet than the other, 8mm from the blade edge. The face without the blade facet is slightly convex across its width, the other face being flat. The fragment has a maximum surviving thickness at the break of 6.8mm and weighs 19.6g. The surface of axe has a dark green to brown patina. The form of the blade fragment is more likely to suggest a flanged axe or palstave, although a socketed axe is possible.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Malmesbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.25.2c.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"21.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
