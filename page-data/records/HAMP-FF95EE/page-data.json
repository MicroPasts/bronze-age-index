The object is rectangular, with a lenticular side profile. Both ends taper to a thin edge; one is notably more flared than the other, suggesting it functioned as the cutting edge, the other end being likely inserted into a handle. The object is slightly irregular in shape and possibly bent and damaged with losses to the blade edge from use. The surface is pitted and has a green patina consistent with prehistoric metalwork.","fourFigureLat":"51.15545788","fourFigureLon":"-1.05766289","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-900","notes":"Small chisels and tools of similar type were used into the Medieval period, but comparable examples on the database such as SF-3041F9, SF-81B0CD and published examples such as Pendleton (1999, fig.67, no.291) suggest a prehistoric date.\n\n\n\nRecorded from details emailed by the finder.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"September 15, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bentworth","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMPFF95EE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"53"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
