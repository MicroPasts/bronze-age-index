The axehead is incomplete and badly corroded, found with two smaller pieces of copper which have possibly been broken off the axehead. The main body of the axehead has been broken diagonally across the butt end, just above the stop ridge, and across the blade, above the cutting edge.\n\nThe surviving blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly convex expanding sides. The casting flash apparent on one side has not been worn down.\n\nThe surface is very badly corroded and is now a bright green colour with some patches of orange-brown. The corrosion covers all of the axehead and seems to have formed in layers.\n\nThe axehead measures 98.14mm in length. At the widest point, across the blade, it measures 32.09mm and at the thickest it measures 27.21mm. It weighs 170g.\n\nThe first piece of copper alloy is 24.98mm in length, 15.36mm wide and 8.45mm thick. It weighs 6.17g. The second piece is 22.87mm long, 10.40g wide and 5.83mm thick. It weighs 2.76g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave was found in close proximity to HAMP-996311 and is therefore to be considered as potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\nSchmidt P.K. and Burgess C.B., 1981, The Axes of Scotland and Northern England, Munich, plate 61, no.839.\n\n\n\nNeedham, S., 1996 Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, 67.","fourFigureLat":"50.93211327","fourFigureLon":"-1.26140689","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"July 04, 2014","datefound2":"July 04, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.21","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Durley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-652028.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"98.14"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
