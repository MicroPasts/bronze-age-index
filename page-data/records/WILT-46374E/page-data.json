The palstave has a U-shaped pattern below the stop ridge, and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan, with convex expanding sides and convex damaged cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being after the stop ridge.\n\n\n\nThe blade, from the cutting edge to the stop ridge, is 66.42mm in length and 22.86 thick, measured close to the stop ridge. The cutting edge is 41.60mm in width and 2.72mm thick.\n\n\n\nBeneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a concave depression, which is bordered by raised ridges. This is broadly sub-rectangular (U-shaped), with three parallel grooves going down to the septum to facilitate the process of hafting. One face of the palstave preserve, near the three grooves of the septum, a through hole linked with forging activities.\n\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe, from the stop ridge to the butt, is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in profile, with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The rear part is 67.63mm in length, 23.10 in width and 23.42mm maximum thick, 4.60mm minimum thick (measured at the foot). The palstave weights 263g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is covered with a green patina.","fourFigureLat":"50.98822798","fourFigureLon":"-2.20083415","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Cristina Sanna","datefound1":"January 31, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Cristina Sanna","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cann","county":"Dorset","district":"North Dorset","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cristinasanna/97169730.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"128.35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
