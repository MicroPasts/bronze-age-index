The base of the socket is evident at break and is rectangular form (38.7mm x 7.0mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 14.6mm). The axe has broken above the blade tips with no surviving blade side remaining on the fragment.  The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded but has a moderate curved edge (with a surviving depth of 12mm). The surviving blade face fragments are convex across their widths and slightly convex across their short surviving lengths. The surface has remnant patches of a dark-brown patina and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base would imply a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.","fourFigureLat":"51.71079047","fourFigureLon":"-4.78047182","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Jeffreyston","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017152new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"27.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
