A copper alloy palstave with single mid rib and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On both faces of the blade there is a single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The surface of the blade has traces of hammer marks forming irregular lines across the wide blade facet. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion, but appears to be symmetrical. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam. There is a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. The flange sides are a sub triangle in profile with casting seams. One side, at the junction of the blade and stop there is an integral loop which is has a sub-lozenge section. The void is a sub semi-circle. In plan the septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, whose butt is rectangular with rounded corners. The surface of the palstave a dark brown/green patina which is incomplete and there is a patch of active corrosion at the butt on both faces. The palstave measures 148.82mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.53mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 32.11mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 337.2g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group II type which has a mid rib decoration. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments that the palstave '...fits within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII and is likely to be part of the Acton Park II metalworking assemblage. This form is very common in the west mids and marches'.\n\n\n\nA similar axe is illustrated in Savoury (1980), Figure 23, No. 171\n\n\n\nSavory, H.N. 1980 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections National Museum of Wales, Cardiff","fourFigureLat":"52.05805129","fourFigureLon":"-2.27852735","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2014","datefound2":"June 08, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"32.11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upton-upon-Severn","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Malvern Hills","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-3A6465a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"148.82"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
