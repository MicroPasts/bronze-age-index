The fragment encompasses the upper end of the blade, the stop and the majority of the septum. The septum has a surviving length of 45mm and is broken at an angle. It is possible that the position at the end of the septum is the butt of the palstave, although this can not be demonstrated. The septum is comparatively flat and has a thickness of 6-7mm. Both of the sides are straight for the length of the fragment. The flanges are eroded, but are unlikely to have arched any higher than the maximum thickness at the stop, which is 23.2mm. No loop or remnants are evident on the sides and the casting flashes are no longer visible. The stops are straight and right-angled to the flanges. One of the stops has a large aperture (12mm wide and 13mm deep) as a result of casting problems. The stop is raised above the level of the blade and slopes down to the blade. No decoration is evident on the blade, although one face suggests some hollowing below the stop. The blade side is rounded across its depth. None of the original surface survives on the palstave, which is heavily pitted and has a pale to mid-green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.859925","fourFigureLon":"-4.934915","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"Any identification of type is tentative because of the fragmentary and eroded nature of the axe. However, it seems likely that the palstave is unlooped and the arrangement of the flanges may indicate a palstave of 'Low-Flanged' type (Group III palstave), which can be ascribed to the Taunton-Cemmaes metalworking stage, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 5, c. 1500 - 1200BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Spittal","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.94.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"74.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
