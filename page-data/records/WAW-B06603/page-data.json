In section the spearhead is, at the upper terminal, is a lozenge and the lower edge is a tubular, but is incomplete. The broken edges are not too recent. \n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a broken side edge which reveals the interior of the socket. The other side face is abraded and reveals an incomplete side-loop. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has traces of a mid grey patina, otherwise the surface is heavily abraded.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 71.06mm in length, 19.88mm in width, 14.85mm thick, and weighs 26.05g.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions.
