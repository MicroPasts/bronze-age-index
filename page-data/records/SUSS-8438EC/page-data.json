It is also possible that this item dates to the Iron Age or later and this is also discussed below. The remaining fragment is a portion of one of the cauldron's handle loops, but this fragment has broken off from the larger vessel, now missing. The fragment is curved in profile, with three deeply grooved ridges on the outer surface, which have been indented along the centre, suggesting that another element abutted this area. The interior edge of the loop is smooth and undecorated. Both surfaces have a dark green patina and colour. This fragment measures 19.2mm long, 13.1mm wide, 3.4mm thick and weighs 3.78 grams.\n\n\n\nA parallel with additional portions of the vessel attachment has been recorded onto the PAS database as: SF-832744 . That example was extensively discussed by specialists and a portion of that discussion is included here:\n\n\n\n'This is a handle from a large sheet copper-alloy cauldron. Parallels in the Late Bronze Age are noted with Gerloff's (1986) Class A cauldrons, notably the Shipton Type and Tulnacross Type caulrons (Gerloff, 1986: pp. 93-97, cf. fig. 10 for examples from the Isleham Hoard; see Ashmolean Museum AN 1928.324 for the Shipton-on-Cherwell cauldron). See also examples of buckets with similar handles in Gerloff (2004), notably from Hatfield (Gerloff, 2004: fig. 17.4). These would indicate a date range in the Late Bronze Age Penard to Ewart Park phases, perhaps c.1200-700 BC. However, similarities with later, Iron Age, examples are also evident, such as in parallels from Sheepen in Essex (Colchester Caslte Museum) and the Battersea Cauldron (BM 1861, 0309.1), which have similar sheet construction and cast copper-alloy handles. The current example is quite possibly Late Bronze Age in date, perhaps as early as the last quarter of the 2nd millennium BC, however a later (Iron Age or later) date range cannot be ruled out entirely.'","fourFigureLat":"52.66578814","fourFigureLon":"1.07453739","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"October 27, 2015","datefound2":"October 27, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Liz Walker","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"East Tuddenham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS8438ECFragmentofUncertainObject.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"19.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
