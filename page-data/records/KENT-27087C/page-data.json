The cutting edge is a wide convex crescent shape in plan. The blade is very short and has a steep drop from the body to the cutting edge, with some clear hammer blows and polishing striations visible on the surface. These features suggest an axe-head which has been maintained, the metal redrawn via hammering and re-sharpened a significant number of times. It is difficult to suggest the extent of this maintenance/reuse as palstaves dating from the latter end of the period tend to have shorter blades. Features to place this example within a chronological group have not survived, thus being able to suggest its shortness relates only to reuse and rather than style is not possible. At the broken end, which equates to the beginning of the palstave's likely rectangular body, a subtle shadow suggests the rib indicating its classification as a palstave axe. The break appears to be relatively recent and almost certainly relates to modern agricultural process. The fragment is very dark green on the body with a slightly different more olive green along the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 45.58mm wide, 39.74mm long, 13.46mm thick and 84.01g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"51.33695583","fourFigureLon":"0.61142006","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.46","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hartlip","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT27087C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"39.74"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
