BC 2000 - 1700). The axehead is broadly rectangular, with a flared and curved cutting edge at one end. It is lozenge-shaped when viewed from the side, with a rectangular section. Both ends of the object are chipped and worn. The object has a green patina. It is 53.97mm in length, 20.30mm in width and 7.09mm in thickness. It weighs 28.83g.\n\n\n\nThis object parallels in miniature axeheads from the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III) of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. A number of similar miniature axeheads are recorded on the database, including: SUR-267CEF and DEV-B0516A. The small size of the object suggests that it may have had a votive function.","fourFigureLat":"54.33149082","fourFigureLon":"-2.5089671","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss.
