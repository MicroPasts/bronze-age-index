It is probably a cast copper alloy flat axe dating from the Early Bronze Age,  that is c. 2150-1500BC. The axe is narrow with tapering sides and there are no signs of a stop ridge. It has a rounded butt and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders judging from the slightly tapering sides it is probably an earlier flat axe (that is from c. 2150-1700BC) rather than a later one from the Migdale metalworking tradition. It shares similarities with axes of the Brithdir and Willerby metalwork traditions (Rohl and Needham 1990, 102). No signs of ridges or flanges are present indicating that this is an early flat axe. The length is 65mm, the width is 34mm thickness 10mm and the weight 65.35g.","fourFigureLat":"53.85263105","fourFigureLon":"-2.92879003","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"March 02, 2017","datefound2":"March 02, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Singleton","county":"Lancashire","district":"Fylde","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMEC7A2A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
