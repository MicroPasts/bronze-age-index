It is probably a fragment from a Class A Ewart Park sword.  The blade has a rounded mid-rib with a slight hollowing before the edge bevels.  The fragment is very abraded with edge losses and the copper alloy has a patchy patina with some corrosion.  The breaks have the same patina as the surface suggesting the damage occurred in antiquity.\n\nDimensions: length: 57.00mm; width: 26.28mm; thickness: 6.58mm; weight: 33.92g.","fourFigureLat":"51.66909121","fourFigureLon":"-1.20610748","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kate Sumnall","datefound1":"July 29, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Paula Levick","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.58","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clifton Hampden","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/plevick/Devonald - BA blade - aug 06.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Berkshire","length":"57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
