The blade portion of the axe  remains with the broken edge traversing the axe. The blade cutting edge  is almost symmetrical and is rounded and blunt. In section, from the break to the blade  the section is an elongated triangle. The break is not recent as the  patina on the break matches that on the surface of the axe. The surface  of the axe is abraded and pitted. The axe weighs 79.5g. From the cutting edge to the  broken edge it measures 34.28mm; across the blade, from tip to tip, it  measures 65.53mm wide; across the break it is 8.26mm thick.\n\n\nThe whether the axe was originally a socketed axe or flat axe is not  known for certain but the size may suggest it is more likely to be a flat axe dating to the early Bronze Age; 2,150 â€“ 1500 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.31892712","fourFigureLon":"-1.79603421","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"February 22, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.26","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tanworth-in-Arden","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-A10616.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"34.28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
