The axe is represented by a blade fragment only with surviving dimensions of 27.7mm long, &nbsp;max 54mm wide and 12.3mm thick and weighs 62.82g. The top of the fragment has traces of the base socket, broken in old damage. The blade faces are flat across the width and gradually convergent with no traces of ribbing surviving. The remaining portion of the surviving side of the blade is flat, creating a sub-rectangular section at the break. The blade gently flares to the slightly curved edge, which is damaged and missing its original surface.\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe,&nbsp;c. 1150 &ndash; 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.\n\nThe object is a light green mottled patina with areas of bronze corrosion particularly on/near the blade edge and the break.
