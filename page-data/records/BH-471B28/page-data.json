The fragment is broadly rectangular and lozenge-shape in cross section - this being typical of the Bronze Age. The edges of the blade are narrow, uneven and very worn. The corners are rounded. The blade is not parallel with one end slightly wider and thinner than the other. Neither face is decorated. All surfaces have&nbsp;an uneven mid brown and mid to dark green patina.\n\nThe blade measures 32.2mm in length, 10.5mm in width, 3.1mm in thickness and weighs 4.36 grams.\n\nSeveral similar slightly larger blades are recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database. This includes BH-E1E7E6, WILT-9D21F1, WILT-90C8FE and SUR-750511, all of which are dated to the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.84204052","fourFigureLon":"0.08887389","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"August 20, 2014","datefound2":"August 20, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Much Hadham","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"East Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH471B28.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
