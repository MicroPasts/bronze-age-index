The object is a flanged axehead type. The object consists of a concave butt with tapering sides. It has parallel slightly flanged edges tapering outwards before becoming part of the curved edge of the blade. The blade then tapers gently on either side meeting forming the cutting edge. The object is undecorated though treating with renaissance wax has been attempted resulting in a purple patina. The original patina was brown with green corrosion, and there are traces of green indicating its copper alloy consititution. The blade has pitted badly on both sides and one side of the blade is also badly pitted along the septum and butt end. The object is consistent in form with the Arreton flanged axes, dating to the Metal Assemblage type VI, circa 1700-1500 corresponding to late Early Bronze Age and the early Middle Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nOverall length: 94.2mm; blade width: 50mm; Thickness: 12.1mm; Butt width: 6.28mm; Septum length: 65.52mm; Weight: 133.44g.","fourFigureLat":"53.05194306","fourFigureLon":"-0.98699223","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Phil Hughes","datefound1":"August 31, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Phil Hughes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Halloughton","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Newark and Sherwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENO177CFA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"94.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
