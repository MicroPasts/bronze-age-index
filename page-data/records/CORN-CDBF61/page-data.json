Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face and base of the ingot are smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and the sides of the fragment have ridges and cavities typically seen in the sections of these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), the neighbouring parish, which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, PLate 36, Nos.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork, and an ingot fragment from Churston Ferrers, Torbay on page 457, Plate 40, No.306b, which was found with a larger plano-convex ingot.","fourFigureLat":"50.075799","fourFigureLon":"-5.677208","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"March 25, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"30","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sennen","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/May2013finds52.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"37"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
