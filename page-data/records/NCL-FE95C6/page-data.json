The crescent-shaped blade tapers at its shoulders to the butt of the axehead. A very narrow stop is visible on the septum, but there is no trace of anything other than minor flanges over the septum of the axe. The butt has suffered some minor damage to its rounded end. There is no evidence for a loop on the upper face of of the axehead.\n\n\nThe surface is relatively smooth, but still pitted and uneven in its condition.","fourFigureLat":"54.0177","fourFigureLon":"-1.72678","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"April 05, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"40.21","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.64","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Menwith with Darley","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/NCLFE95C6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"123.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
