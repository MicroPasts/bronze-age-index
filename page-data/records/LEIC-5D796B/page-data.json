This is circular in cross section and widens as it reaches the head from 2mm to 3.5 mm in diameter. The head is 3 mm deep and 11 mm in diameter. It is circular in form and triangular in cross section, emerging from the shaft and widening to form a disc with a concave upper surface which contains a central circular depression. There is no decoration.\n\n\n\nPins of this type are hard to date as they are not often discovered within hoards. The artefact form is likely to be prevalent from the Ornament Horizon (1500 / 1400 BC) through into the Iron Age (at least until 500 BC). The form of the pin is similar to SF-509598, described as a Picardy type and dated to 1400-1250BC and is also similar to examples excavated from Flag Fen (Flag fen cat no 173-185 fig 10.9 pp274-275) these later examples have be dated through metalurgical anaylsis to the Wilburton phases of the later Bronze Age (Needham Period 6) c. 1150-1000 BC. This pin is also similar in form to SUR-3762E7, which is dated 900-600BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.6185874","fourFigureLon":"-0.79022511","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"February 01, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Elisabeth Janovsky","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"11","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leighfield","county":"Rutland","district":"Rutland","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ejkj1/LEIC5D796B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"27"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
