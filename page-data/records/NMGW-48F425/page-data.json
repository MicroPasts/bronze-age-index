The better preserved side has a small area of the mouth surviving, which is slightly out-turned (with a thickness of 4.8mm) with no discernible evidence for a collar moulding. The socket is of rounded rectangular form (with a depth of 60.9mm). The casting seam is raised, extenuated by a slight mismatching in the mould alignment but is neatly finished. The sides are moderately angled to the central seam, giving a sub-hexagonal body section to the axe. The side is straight along its length before a gentle expansion at the blade. The blade is very slightly expanded (with a blade width of 43.2mm) and has a modest curve (with a depth of 10mm). The original blade edge has been lost.&nbsp; The better preserved face (with a thickness of 2.9mm &ndash; 3.6mm) has a gentle convexity across both its length and width, with no blade facet evident. The face has the suggestion of parallel or near parallel ribs, now worn and corroded. The surface is heavily-corroded but there is a distinct black patina, possibly tenorite surviving over much of the external surface. Otherwise, the surface has corroded pale-green. \n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe, lacking the mouth makes typological identification uncertain. The general form, dimensions and ribbed decoration of the axe are all consistent with South Wales (Stogursey) Type axes of Ewart Park metalworking, c. 950 &ndash; 750BC. The heavily-patinated, possible tenorite deposits on the axe are of interest, possibly indicating a deliberate black colouring of the axe[1]. \n\n\n[1] Dr M. Davis Pers.
