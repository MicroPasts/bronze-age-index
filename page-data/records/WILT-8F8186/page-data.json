It measures 49.6x40x7.3mm and weighs 48.13g. The surfaces are bumpy and all original patina has been lost. The metal is a rich orangey brown in colour, not dissimilar to the colour of some Bronze Age metal work. Where this brown has been worn away the metal beneath is bluey green. The crescentic cut seems intentional and appears to have a smooth, worn edge.","fourFigureLat":"51.014548","fourFigureLon":"-1.559462","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"November 24, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mottisfont","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/BrownJanUnid.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society","length":"49.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
