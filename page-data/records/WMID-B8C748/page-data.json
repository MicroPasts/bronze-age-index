The septum gradually tapers towards the butt. The flanges start off parallel to the stop ridge and taper in a straight diagonal line to the butt. The blade has concave sides as it expands towards a crescentic blade edge. The blade is longer than the butt. No decoration is visible on the blade of the palstave. No casting flaws seem to be present. The blade edge is incomplete, with the cutting edge no longer present. Slight traces of the casting seam are visible along one of the blade sides. No loop, shield or knick are present.\n\n\n\nMeasurements:\n\nOverall Length: 153.5 mm\n\nMaximum Width: 55.00 mm\n\nMaximum thickness: 31.5 mm\n\nSeptum Length: 63.4 mm\n\nButt width: 19.8 mm\n\nButt thickness: 5.1 mm\n\nFlange Height: 10.3 mm\n\nStop ridge height: 12.1 mm\n\nBlade length: 92.9 mm\n\nBlade width (stop ridge): 25.4 mm\n\nBlade width (edge): 54.9 mm\n\nBlade thickness: 4.4 mm\n\nWeight: 432.3 g\n\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement while within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of most of the original surface.\n\n\n\nThis palstave fits within the Early Phase Palstave types, consistent with dating between c. 1500 to C. 1250 cal BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.60675815","fourFigureLon":"-2.07526637","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Essington","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/wmidb8c748.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"153.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
