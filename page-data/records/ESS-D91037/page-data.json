The axe is incomplete, with a deliberate break across the body, removing the blade end. The mouth opening is rectangular with rounded corners; there is a double mouth moulding, with the upper moulding being wider and more pronounced than the lower moulding. The side loop extends from the lower moulding. The casting seam is visible down the side of the axe and loop. The body of the axe has been slightly distorted, being crushed inwards, making the opening of the deliberate break narrower. The axe has an even brown patina, with small patches of light green corrosion showing through, particularly around the lower break.\n\n\nThe axe is about 60mm long and weighs approximately 140 grams (provided by the finder).","fourFigureLat":"51.852814","fourFigureLon":"1.207586","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"\nFind reported via email; Identification from finders photographs\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura McLean","datefound1":"September 20, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura McLean","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thorpe-le-Soken","county":"Essex","district":"Tendring","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lmclean/ESS-D91037.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
