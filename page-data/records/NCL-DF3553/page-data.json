A probable type Lissett metalworking phase (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981,100; plate 48, numbers 616-620).The axe is subrectangular, with a square butt which has been damaged. There is differential wear on the axe blade indicating that the axe has been used. The septem, the area between the flanges, terminates in a faint shield like depression. The casting flashes or seams have been removed and hammered flat. There is an notable casting line on the profile of one side , which could be a flaw or something reproduced from in the mould. These are more common in northern areas of the UK, while palstave axes are more frequent in the South. This axe has a long blade with a slightly divergent sides.\n\n\n\nThe patina of the axe - its bronzy colour - could be from cleaning, however the attached photograph shows the axe directly after discovery and suggest that the object has been buried in anerobic conditions for at least part of the time it has been buried. This is further evidences by its findspot which indicates a marshy area covered by hillwash. \n\n\n\nDUR-05101C\n\n\n\nDimentions:\n\nWeight - 218.51g\n\nLength - 127.08mm\n\nWidth of Blade - 41.66mm\n\n\n\nWidth of butt - mm\n\nHeight if flanges - 18.29\n\nWidth at Flanges - 17.97","fourFigureLat":"54.15250818","fourFigureLon":"-1.72589411","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Agate","datefound1":"April 23, 2022","datefound2":"April 24, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Agate","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"18.29","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Laverton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/andyagate/NCLDF3553.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Tyne and Wear Museums","length":"127.08"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
