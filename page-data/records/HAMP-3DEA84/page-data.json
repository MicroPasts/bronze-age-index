The blade begins at a break and broadens towards the tip, both surfaces are undecorated. The fragment is curved which has created one convex and one concave face. The convex face has a tranverse crack or tear on the blade (8.7mm long with the central deeper portion 4.3mm long) and the surface is covered in scratches which do not seem to be in a consistent direction. The concave face is also covered in fine scratches aligned parallel to the edges. The break on this side has a slight bulge running the width of the break where it has been bent and broken. \n\n\n\nWidth (max blade): 51.4mm\n\n\n\nWidth (min): 34.6mm\n\n\n\nThickness (max): 11.2mm\n\n\n\nThickness (min): 4.2mm","fourFigureLat":"51.06181564","fourFigureLon":"-0.67426599","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"Images are drafts and will be edited.\n\n\n\nEdward Caswell comments: At the broadest interpretation this could be the blade of a palstave or a flat axehead dating c.2400-1150 cal BC. Being a bit more risky I’d lean towards palstave and probably a later variety due to its width (c.1400-1150 cal BC) based on the dimensions and blade shape, but that’s very much a feel thing based on the ones I’ve seen.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments: I agree with Edward Caswell but I might be even more cautious and suggest that it is a tool blade, given the narrow width and thicknesses involved. With those dimensions I wonder if we might be dealing with a tanged chisel. The break is noteworthy - from the profile it has either been used as a lever and broken through use (the equivalent of using a screwdriver to open a tin of stubborn paint) or possibly more likely, evidence of deliberate destruction.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jenny Durrant","datefound1":"January 01, 2022","datefound2":"January 31, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jenny Durrant","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lurgashall","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/HAMP3DEA8402.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
