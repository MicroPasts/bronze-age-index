Only a fragment of the blade-end survives. The fragment is rectangular in plan with a flared blade with concave shoulders. The tips of the blade are missing as is much of the original surface. The sides of the axe are thickened; starting to develop into flanges, so the break in cross-section is H shaped. The break is irregular and well patinated, suggesting that it occured by accident in antiquity. The surface is mottled green and severely pitted with areas of corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe length of the axe is 54.6mm, the width is 51.2mm from tip to tip, and the main body at the break is 24.1mm wide and 14.1mm thick. 100.32g.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. It is probably a Developed flat axe, similar to Aylesford Type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981) from the later Early Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"53.57576117","fourFigureLon":"-1.33697736","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"August 31, 2014","datefound2":"September 30, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"South Kirkby and Moorthorpe","county":"Wakefield","district":"Wakefield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2372_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"54.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
