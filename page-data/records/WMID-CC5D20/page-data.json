The axhead is complete and suffers minimal damage. Where damage it occurs it is chiefly along the blade, although there are some other scuff marks elswhere. The uneven patina along much of the blade suggests that some of this damage occurred whilst the object was in the ground.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 109.2 mm long and 41.3 mm wide. It weighs 261.5 grams. It tapers from 41 mm thick at the socketed end to 2 mm thick at the blade. The axe is hollow, with a socket for attachment of a haft. The socket is sub-rectangular in shape and measures 41 mm by 41 mm. The axehead is waisted, tapering slightly from the socket to the centre, and then flaring again to the blade. A raised collar runs around the axehead at approximately 15 mm from the socket. On each side four decorative ribs emanate from this collar, running for approximately 33 mm in the direction of the blade. On one edge, situated just after the collar, there is a semi-circular moulded attachment loop. On each edge there is a casting seam which runs down the length of the axe.\n\n\n\nThe axehead has a fairly even dark green patina with patches of paler green copper corrosion in places. This axe fits within the socketed and faceted axe typology; specifically into the division type Meldreth which is broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age. It is associated with the later phases of the Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and earlier phases of the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-800 CAL. BC. Broadly these forms of faceted axes have a distribution on the Eastern side of Britain and suggest a southern British metalworking tradition (cf Schmidt & Burgess).","fourFigureLat":"52.723601","fourFigureLon":"-2.10508","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"June 30, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"41","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penkridge","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-CC5D20.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"109.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
