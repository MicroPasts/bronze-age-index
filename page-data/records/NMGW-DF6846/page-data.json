The jet is of a roughly circular form and displays all four runners.  The four runners together with its geographic location strongly hint at the jet being removed from an axe of type Storgursey or 'South Wales Type'.  The patina on the casting jet varies from a brown to light green and the jet now displays a sheen due to polish or lacquer applied by the finder.  The external diameter of the jet is 39.2mm - 45.3mm, with an internal diameter of 16.4mm - 19.3mm.  The jet has a maximum thickness of 15.6mm.  The distance between the runners is 31.6mm and 29.5mm, implying an axe of usual proportions around its mouth, possibly with a square socket.  The jet has a weight of 52.1g.","fourFigureLat":"51.509691","fourFigureLon":"-3.47116817","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"The casting jet can be securely ascribed to the Ewart Park tradition of metalworking, belonging to Needham's (1996) metalworking stage 7.  For some time it has been realised Stogursey axes can be placed at the end of the Bronze Age and this has recently been varified by Needham et.al (1997), making it possible to place production between 950-750 cal. BC.\nThis find represents the only complete example of a casting jet with four runners in Wales the author is aware of.  The nearest welsh parallels are the jet associated with the St. Mellons hoard, Cardiff and a possible example from Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais.  In Needham's (1981) catalogue of Stogursey axes he lists seven examples, six of which are associated with the Stogursey Hoard, the other is from Lelant, Cornwall.  Evans (1881) records another from Kenidjack Cliff, Cornwall, associated with socketed axes.\nIt has been noted elsewhere (needham 1981, Brigs and Williams 1995, Northover) the discrepency between the majority of finds of Stogursey axes in South East Wales and stone molds from Southern England.  This find might be adding weight to the argument of local manufacture.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Philip MacDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"45.3","edge":null,"thickness":"15.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
