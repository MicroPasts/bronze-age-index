The general form of the axe is complete, however it has suffered significant loss from corrosion at both the cutting edge and the butt. In plan the axe is broadly rectangular with narrow rounded butt and expanded / splayed cutting edge. In profile the axe is lentoid. In section the axe is broadly rectangular (rectangular with rounded edges) and there are no signs of raised flanges or hafting augmentation. There is also no sign of a proto stop ridge / median bevel. The surface patina has been poorly preserved and the majority has flaked away because of laminating surface corrosion. One face is better preserved than the other. The remaining surface patina shows evidence of decoration - specifically small lentoid shaped depressions aligned vertically on the axe blade. This form of decoration is known as rain pattern and is common on some axes of the later early bronze age. The long edges of the axe are also poorly preserved, again it is possible there are some facets possibly suggesting cable like decoration. The axe is a light green to light brown colour and has an uneven polished patina; elements of the axe are still coated in soil. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age of metalworking stage IV which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Migdale Variant Biggar (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 18-19. 220 Knapton or 229 Stamfordham).\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 150.2mm long, the cutting edge has a width of 68.2 mm and the butt is 30.6 mm wide. It has a thickness of 9.3 mm at the centre of the axe, the blade has a thickness of 6.3 mm and the butt has a thickness of 6.9 mm. The axe weighs 290.3 g.","fourFigureLat":"52.17688778","fourFigureLon":"-3.31758845","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Glascwm","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMID-798FF7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"150.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
