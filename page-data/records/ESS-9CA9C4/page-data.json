This fragment represents the lower body and blade of the axe. When complete it would have been a flattened lentoid in profile. The remains of the body of the axe flare broadly into the crescentic blade. The cutting edge and blade tips are now heavily worn. To either side of the body of the axe are barely perceptible, low flanges that diminish before reaching the blade. The surface of the axe is heavily pitted. The original surface has a mid green patina, but exposed lower surfaces are light green and bright green. The upper body and butt of the axe are missing. The break is almost horizontal and well worn, suggesting damage occurred in antiquity. The regular break may suggest that it was deliberately broken, perhaps for inclusion in a scrap hoard. The axe is 50.54mm long, 44.82mm wide from blade tip to tip, has a maximum thickness of 7.98mm and weighs 77.55g. It probably dates to the Aylesford phase, c.2000-1900BC.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.98","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Horkesley","county":"Essex","district":"Colchester","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/Bowyer falt axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"50.54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
