At the break the spearhead is sub-circular sectioned (with a maximum diameter of 16.4mm) and the internal socket is sub-circular to oval (10mm x 11.5mm). The socket is considerably thicker on one side (5.0mm thick compared to 0.8mm) causing a weakness in the socket wall and probably resulting in the break. There is no evidence that the socket has broken through perforations for attachment. The damaged blades are present at the break across the socket (giving a surviving width of 19.5mm). The blades are largely damaged and truncated, surviving on one side (with a length of 51.6mm and a thickness of 1.6mm) and has a moderate convex curve to the tip. The blade edge is evident over short areas but has largely been lost. The socket is conical, gradually narrowing to the tip (where it has a diameter of 3mm). Striations are evident where the surface survives, running along the socket and adjacent blade. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a dark-brown patina and some patches of green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the spearhead where the diagnostic features have been lost, makes typological identification indeterminate. Socketed spearheads begin in Arreton phase towards the end of The Early Bronze Age and continue to the Ewart Park Phase of the Late Bronze Age. The form of the spearhead probably suggests that it is unlikely to be from the types found in the Arreton phase and is likely to date from Acton Park to Ewart Park, dated to c. 1550 – 800BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.11699475","fourFigureLon":"-3.00911745","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Willersley and Winforton","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/201943.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"103.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
