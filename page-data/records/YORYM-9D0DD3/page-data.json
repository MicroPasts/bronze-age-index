The object is 14.7mm in diameter, 4.7mm thick and weighs 3.1g\n\nPenannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC), usually being gold plated around copper cores. They are commonly referred to as &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; but their function remains uncertain. It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. The uncertainties around their use are complicated by the fact that very few are recorded from secure archaeological contexts.\n\nWhile the general form of this ring is consistent with such Bronze Age objects, the lack of a gold covering makes it difficult to be certain. This object may be more recent and serve a different function than that suggested.","fourFigureLat":"53.74908357","fourFigureLon":"-0.5911716","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"14.7","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ellerker","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/CHC0160.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
