The parallel sides are relatively straight, expanding towards a curved shaped blade that has a width of 30.28 mm. The rounded blade is slightly damaged along one side. Both faces of the object are heavily abraded and pitted with a light brown patina with patches of bright green. The edges are rough and have a green patina.\n\n\n\nThe axehead probably fits into the earliest phases of metalworking in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-3 c.2500-2050 cal.BC, or slightly later.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples on the PAS database have been recorded under various types, including miniature object e.g. YORYM-CE8933 (59.01 mm), flat axe e.g. KENT-CF6F79 (80.6 mm) and YORYM-D53C89, chisel e.g. SUSS-9B7F13 (65.17 mm) and flat axehead e.g. LVPL-03D15C (61.5 mm).\n\n\n\nNeedham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age , Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140\n\n\n\nDimensions:\n\nLength: 73.29 mm\n\nWidth: 30.28 mm\n\nThickness: 7.18 mm (rounded edge) and 3.45 mm (butt end)\n\nWeight: 123.39g","fourFigureLat":"53.40351823","fourFigureLon":"-0.28671837","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lisa Brundle","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lisa Brundle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walesby","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/guisachan/Lin65381C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"73.29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
