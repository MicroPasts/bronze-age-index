The blade edge is convex with a crescent blade and a pointed oval (vesica) in cross section. It narrows from this blade before terminating in a horizontal regular break that is now very abraded. \n\n\n\nThe axehead has a thick layer of light brown green patination chipped away in places to reveal a medium green colour beneath.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is 31.5mm wide, 9.6mm long, 4.78mm thick and weighs 4.5 grams.\n\n\n\nThe fragment represents part of the blade end possibly of a rectangular bodied socketed axe dating to the Late Bronze Age, however the lack of diagnostic feature means that an the potential for this to have come from a flat, flanged or Palstave axe cannot be excluded.","fourFigureLat":"51.850739","fourFigureLon":"-1.55135005","fromdate":"-2400","todate":"-800","notes":"Oxfordshire PAS Rally Record Sheet No: Y335","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"September 13, 2019","datefound2":"September 13, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Michael Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cornbury and Wychwood","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/maritime/Y335.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":"31.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
