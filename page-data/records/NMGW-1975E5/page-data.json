The bracelet is of circular section with a diameter of between 4.9 and 6.1mm. The terminals are expanded and are of circular section with diameters of between 9.0 and 9.8mm. The expanded terminals are central with respect to the hoop. The bracelet is oval with a maximum internal diameter of 60.5mm. The original surface of the bracelet has been lost and the current surface is pitted. The bracelet weighs 39.7g. The bracelet is difficult to date since there are few diagnostic features on the object. Metallurgical analysis using a Scanning Electron Microscope suggested that the bronze composition was consistent with a Late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.613313","fourFigureLon":"-4.297814","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"A number of bronze penannular bracelets have been found in Late Bronze Age contexts or found in association with other Bronze Age artefacts. A hoard of similar bracelets were found at Llanrhaiadar-ym-Mochnant, Powys (Savory 1980, No. 257). This bracelet falls within Eogan's (1994, 85) Variety 7, which is defined by a solid body with a round cross-section and outwardly expanding solid terminals. Although defining gold bracelets, Eogan (1994, 85) states that this Variety is more frequenly produced in bronze. Similar penannular bracelets have been found in Scottish hoards: Auctertyre, (Morayshire) Glentanner (Aberdeenshire), Monmore, Killin (Perthshire), Wester Ord, Rosskeen (Ross & Cromarty). All the hoards are associated with Late Bronze Age Socketed axes and all but the Glentanner hoard associated with a faceted socketed axe.\n\n\n\nIt is also possible that the bracelet may be of Iron Age or Early Medieval date.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"60.5","edge":null,"thickness":"6.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llangennith, Llanmadoc and Cheriton","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/Dscn2720.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
