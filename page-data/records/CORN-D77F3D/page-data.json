The mid-rib is more pronounced than those on either side, measuring 3 mm in height. All of the ribs are 5 mm in thickness. There are pronounced casting seams down both sides of the hammer that are 1.5 mm in thickness, suggesting that the hammer was unfinished as these have not been filed down. There is no evidence of it having any side loop. The collar is 5 mm deep and protrudes 3 mm outwards from one face but it is only 3 mm deep and 1.5 mm thick on the oppposite face and uneven around the upper edge. The socket mouth is lozenge-shaped externally in plan and circular internally and is 25 mm wide and 22 mm deep externally and 14 mm in diameter internally. The body of the hammer is slightly waisted and tapers towards the middle and then expands towards the terminal to a flattened but slightly exapnded convex base that is 30 mm wide by 13 mm deep. This working face has been well used with the typical side protuberances from that use.\n\n\n\nSocketed hammers became more widespread during the Penard phase (c.1200-950 BC). Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart Park Phase (c.800-700 BC) which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800 BC. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples like this one have collars and moulding.\n\n\n\nWhilst hammers are traditionally considered to have a higher tin content in the bronze (Evans 1881) compared to contemporary axes, a large number of records on this database note that based on the weight of the hammers a high lead content is also likely. It is therefore interesting to note that, whilst better preserved and slightly larger than many other examples, this hammer is also heavier than most.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples can be seen in records WAW-75FD95 and SOM-B048D1 on the database.\n\n\n\nThe Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website (https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/hammers) comments that the \"socketed hammer is only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976, 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA'.\" Dr Dot Boughton suggests a likely date range of c. 1000-800 BC, although noting that it could possibly later c. 900-700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.2851372","fourFigureLon":"-1.98704548","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"January 01, 1930","datefound2":"December 31, 1939","subsequentActionTerm":"In a private collection, recorded for academic use","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"22","diameter":"25","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Unknown","parish":"Market Lavington","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN6031.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"92.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
