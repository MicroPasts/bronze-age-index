The axe has a deep and trumpet shaped collar, whose lower margins are defined by three horizontal grooves, with a combined maximum width of approximately 4mm. The mouth top is flat, but the original shape of the mouth in plan is now unknown, due to distortion and bending of the fragment. The loop is slender and its upper arm descends from within the lower collar zone. The upper surviving face-edge on the loop-side has been emphasised by a vertical rib descending from the grooved collar lower margin. A facet is also visible on the upper face, running in near parallel with the ribbed face-edge, the facet edge also descending from the grooved collar margin. The axe fragment has been severely bent out of shape in the upper collar area, possibly in antiquity and prior to the burial of the artefact. The artefact has a brown patina and the break-edges look to be ancient. The axe fragment has suffered a modern glancing scrape along the upstanding and ribbed face-edge and on the collar, revealing areas of green patina and surface shine, where the original surfaces have been damaged. It is likely that this surface damage occurred during the recent discovery and retrieval of the socketed axe by the finder, or by through impact with agricultural machinery, when the axe was disturbed and dispersed from its original burial context.\n\n\n\n\nSmall ribbed socketed axe (undiagnostic to type) - blade fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: maximum surviving length 27.4mm; width at upper break 36.6mm; blade width 42.8mm; max. surviving depth of socket approx. 11mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 40.6g. \n\n\n\nThis is a blade-end fragment of a small bronze socketed axe, with just the base of the socket present and surviving. Near the blade, the sides flare out with concave curves to provide a modestly expanded blade edge. The ends of ribbed decoration is evident on both faces, four ribs present on one face, and one, possibly two ribs surviving on the opposite face. The ribs extend far down the face of the axe, their ends being between 12-18mm from the blade edge. Prominent casting seams are evident down each side, however appear to have been rapidly hammered down. Striations parallel with the blade edge suggest it was prepared for use after casting. The socket mould part was misaligned during casting, resulting in an extremely thin face wall on one side (0.7mm thick) and a thickened wall on the other (3.8-4.3mm thick). The axe fragment has a brown surface patina. There are localised patches near the blade edge where original surfaces have not survived and these have a green patina.\n\n\n\nIdentification & Discussion \n\n\n\nOne of the artefact fragments (Cat. 1, above) may be identified as a Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham or Class D slender faceted axe. The deep and trumpet shaped collar, slender form and facet on the surviving upper face are all diagnostic of Class D / Type Meldreth axes, while the lower horizontal grooved moulding typifies the Type Aylsham Variant (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 204-7; Needham 1990, 41-3; Gwilt et al 2005, 37-8). Type Meldreth axes are generally regarded as of British type, although they do occur in Ireland and France (O' Connor 1980, 166-7; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 53-62, Cats. 296-392). Nearly all of the known hoard associations containing these axes are securely of Late Bronze Age date and belonging to the Ewart Park phase between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61), although a few examples have been found in slightly earlier Late Bronze Age hoards dating to 1150-1000 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 210-1; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61). In Wales, approaching 40 examples of slender faceted axes of Meldreth or Class D type are now known, being most common across south-east Wales (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 278 & 282; Gwilt 2004; Northover unpublished, 257-8, 267-9 & Cats. 583-610). Examples of these axes have been found in recently reported hoards from Rossett Community (Wrexham), Llanfrynach Community (Powys), Grosmont Community (Monmouthshire) and Llanharan Community (Rhondda Cynon Taf), all belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt et al 2005; 2016; 2018; Knight et al 2017).\n\n\n\nThe second socketed axe blade fragment (Cat. 2, above) belonged to a small ribbed socketed axe, however this blade end fragment is not diagnostic to precise type. Various forms of ribbed axes are common components of hoards from south-east Wales and belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). For example, ribbed axes of South Wales Type and their Variant forms are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over 40 hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. In addition, ribbed socketed axes, variously known as Southern English/Welby Type ribbed axes, Yorkshire Type axes, Croxton Type axes, Breiddin Type axes and Llanarth Type axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in around a dozen known hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales (e.g. Storrie 1887; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273, 280, 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1.1, 1.3, 1.10; Gwilt & Lodwick 2005; 2006; 2013; Lodwick & Gwilt 2007; Gwilt 2008; Northover unpublished, Hoards 74, 79, 85, 124). Therefore, this presence is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard association from this region.\n\n\n\nThe two reported artefacts were discovered approximately 80m apart and within the same field. Given their contemporary Late Bronze Age date, probably within the Ewart Park phase and dating to 1000-800 BC, it is probable that these two artefacts were once part of a directly associated hoard group and buried in the ground at the same time. It is probable that the ancient hoard group was disturbed and dispersed during recent agricultural activity, such as ploughing, harrowing or during earth movement events in the field.\n\n\n\nA preliminary search of the Heritage Environment Record (HER) for the area (via www.archwilio.org.uk) revealed no Bronze Age features or sites in the adjacent fields. Some prehistoric activity is known to the east on Mynydd Llangors and Cefn Moel, in the form of hut settlements, a putative burnt mound and burial chamber and occasional flint tool finds. It is potentially significant that the landscape location selected for the deposition of this small hoard was in the vicinity of Cwm Nantyfelin stream. This watercourse has its origins in multiple springs draining off the slopes of Cefn Moel, located 1-2km to the east-north-east. It flows westwards and converges with Afon Llynfi, 0.5-1km to the west, before draining into Llangors Lake to the north. This specific watery landscape locality is likely to have been deliberately selected for the deposition of the hoard as a gift to the gods (Gwilt 2004, 121; Gwilt et al 2013, 11). This pattern is repeated with the siting of a number of Late Bronze Age hoards across south-east Wales, adding strength to this observation.","fourFigureLat":"51.90787258","fourFigureLon":"-3.25155055","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"References \n\n\n\nBritish Museum 2008.
