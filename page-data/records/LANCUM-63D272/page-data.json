The fragmetnt is extremely worn and the surface pitted on both side. It is uncertain if it had a midrib, though it is not likely. The cross-section was probably oblong/oval rather than diamong-shaped. It appears to be from a two-edged dagger, dirk or possibly rapier, though judging by its size it is more likely that it came from a dagger or dirk.","fourFigureLat":"54.42991862","fourFigureLon":"-2.60267493","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"February 17, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dot Boughton","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tebay","county":"Cumbria","district":"Eden","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dboughton/LANCUM63D272.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
