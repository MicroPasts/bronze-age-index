The body of the axehead is narrow at 21.43 mm wide, expanding to form a broad crescentic blade, 60.98 mm wide. The flange is around 15.2 mm wide. The axehead itself measures 111.10 mm in length and is 16.8 mm thick. Both faces have two visible but faint transverse bevel lines, one at the junction of the blade and body, and one central line across the body between the flanges. The sides also have slight facets running longitudinally and dividing the flat central area from bevels which run to the top of the flanges. The axehead has a green to brown patina in the centre, turning to a dark green along the edges. There are also green pocks of invasive corrosion on the tip of the blade, the butt, the tops of the ridges and down one side. The axehead dates to the end of the early Bronze Age, probably from around 1700 - 1500 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.750353","fourFigureLon":"-1.749583","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"December 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barton-under-Needwood","county":"Staffordshire","district":"East Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-707483.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"111.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
