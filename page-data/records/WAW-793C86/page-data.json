One of the objects is comprised of two fragments though the proximity of their discovery is not clear. Description 1. Rapier/Dirk fragment. Part of the blade and hilt. The blade expands progressively towards the hilt. Broad central single rib on either face. The blade edge is corrosion damaged, slightly pocked and has a light green patina. L: 59.0mm; W. blade 16.0mm tapering to hilt 29.0mm; Wt: 18.0g. 2. Rapier/Dirk fragment. Part of the blade. Broad central single rib on either face. The blade edge is corrosion damaged, scratched, slightly pocked and has a light green patina. L: 48.5mm; W: 12.0-10.5mm; Wt: 11.6g. 3. Rapier/Dirk fragment. Part of a narrow tapering blade. The blade edge is corrosion damaged, scratched, chipped down the blade edge, slightly pocked on the blade face and has a light green patina. L: 91.0mm; W: 15.0 tapering to 4.0mm; Wt: 29.1g. Dimensions (millimetres/grams) L: length W: width Wt: weight Discussion The two Rapier/Dirk fragments represented by the joining fragments (nos. 1-2) can be dated to the c. 1500-1100 BC when these objects were in circulation. The lack of diagnostic features means that further chronological resolution through typology is not possible. Conclusion Though contextual details are sparse, it is probable that these objects formed a single original deposit or hoard dispersed through the actions of the plough seems very likely. This material is eligible as Treasure under the new Treasure Order (2002) being a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects.
