The ring has a sub-circular cross section and the ends of the terminals are flat. The ring has alternating decorative banding of yellow and a paler, silver rich gold. There is no visible evidence that the ring had a copper alloy core and the weight of the ring suggests that it may be solid gold.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the British Museum's scientific research team has demonstrated that the penannular ring has been modified. A small section of metal has been removed from the edge of each end exposing fresh metal, and the original surfaces of each capped end have also been removed. This is evidenced by the presence of parallel striations and exposure of fresh metal. The appearance of the exposed metal indicates this modification is modern.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 18mm by 17mm diameter; 1.5mm gap between terminals; 6.5mm (max.) and 6mm (min) thickness; weight: 9.47g\n\n\n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of the ring by Department of Scientific Research at The British Museum indicated that its composition was consistent with a Late Bronze Age date. See appended report full details of the composition.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This ring belongs to a well dated group of ornaments of the Late Bronze Age, circa 1150-750 BC. They are a relatively common find from England.","fourFigureLat":"51.11312611","fourFigureLon":"-0.45850121","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-750","notes":"The ring meets the criteria for Treasure under the Designation Order (2002): it is an item of prehistoric date with a precious metal element.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Neil Wilkin","datefound1":"August 31, 2014","datefound2":"September 29, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.86","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cranleigh","county":"Surrey","district":"Waverley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF4056.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"18.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
