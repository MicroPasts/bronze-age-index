The spearhead is relatively short in length, with a narrow and flame-shaped blade. The blade has a lozenge-shaped cross-section, with a narrow and prominent mid-rib. The sides of the mid-rib are straight and converging, extending up to the tip of the blade. Original blade edges no longer survive. Fine striations are visible along the original surfaces, parallel to the blade edge. The breaks along the blade edges and socket appear eroded and largely within the patinated surface, indicating damage cause prior to recent discovery, possibly during antiquity. Two glancing scrapes have exposed fresh bronze across the mid-rib, likely caused during recent discovery and retrieval by the finder.\n\nThe spearhead has a dull grey-green patina. Original surfaces have a dark grey-green patina, surviving in three small patches on one face. The inner surface of the lower socket has a blue patina, located around the lower break edge. The socket is partially blocked by orange-brown clay soil.","fourFigureLat":"51.79349988","fourFigureLon":"-2.98737871","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1100","notes":"Although incomplete, enough survives of this artefact to suggest that it once belonged to a Group 6: Developed side-looped spearhead. Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (Davis 2012, 109). A side-looped spearhead of Davis&rsquo; Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake which had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, 62) to 1680 &ndash; 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 &ndash; 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (ibid., 7). Most Group 6 spearheads however are likely to date from Acton Park and Taunton industries.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Clara de Sousa Cunha","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Abergavenny","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/claracunha/2022984.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"67.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
