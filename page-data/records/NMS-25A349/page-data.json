It has two convex faces which meet each other at a curved edge. The rest of surfaces appear to be irregularly-shaped breaks, which are not recent.\n\n\n\nThe object is heavy for its size, and this may suggest some lead content. It has three holes on one of the broken sides, and several smaller ones on one of the convex sides, probably caused by escaping gas. There are other shallower holes on one of the convex sides, which may be the imprints of grit or small stone pebbles that the molten metal dropped onto. There is one small pebble remaining in one of these holes.\n\n\n\nLength: 49.5mm. Width: 40.5mm. Height: 24.0mm.
