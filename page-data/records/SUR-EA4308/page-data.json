What survives is the upper part of the blade with attachments for the handle. Two rivet holes partially survive as well as a central rivet aligned with the mid-rib of the blade. The fragment is very worn, so much so that the orignal width of this piece may have been double its present size.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments: This example is best compared with plate 35, Luce Bay (Plate 35) Ipswich, or cat. no. 1157 from Teddington - river Thames - not illustrated - (Rowlands BAR no.31, vol 2 p357) described as having a notch-hilted tang - one rivet hole, and a flat mid rib. Like the Teddington example - I would describe this example as notch-hilted with a single central rivet hole, flat-sectioned blade with a low central mid-rib that extends above the two notched rivet holes. The rivet through the tang seems to have a domed head and circular section. All edges are heavily abraded and original surfaces lost.","fourFigureLat":"51.18861405","fourFigureLon":"-0.75648922","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tilford","county":"Surrey","district":"Waverley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF1396.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"61.69"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
