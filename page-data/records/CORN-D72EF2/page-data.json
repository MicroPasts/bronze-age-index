The blade is 33 mm long and expands to a width of 20.5 mm, with a bevelled edge that is 3 mm wide at the widest point of the blade. Below the blade on each side of the socket there is a side loop for binding the spearhead to the spear shaft. The side loops are lozenge-shaped in profile and are 16 mm long, 8 mm wide and 2 mm thick. The socket is circular in section and has an internal diameter of 14 mm and an external diameter of 18 mm with the collar being 2 mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is classified as a Type 4b plain kite-blade, short (Matt Knight pers comm) following Davis, R. 2012, pp.56-59, and dates from the Acton Park phase, c.1500-1400 BC, of the Middle Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nDavis, R. 2012.
