The object consists of two pointed drop-shaped elements (both points partially lost), D-shaped in cross-section and joined at their widest point, by a longitudinally recessed oval neck. There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both domed sides of the object. The two moustache tips or prongs flare slightly outwards and terminate with a small rounded knop. The central neck section of the object is plain and undecorated but the underside (between the two prongs) has a sub-rectangular perforation, believed to facilitate the attachment of the object.\n\n\nLength: 14.93mm, Width: 20.91mm, Thickness: 10.52mm, Weight: 8.3g.\n\nAperture Length: 5.80mm, Width: 4.37mm\n\nThe metal is a mid-green in colour with a slightly pitted patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.30835885","fourFigureLon":"-1.35606679","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-300","notes":"These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are &#39;single&#39; examples while others are &#39;double&#39; like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45, BERK-C3E5A3 and&nbsp;BH-AA1CBE.\nThe open area at the centre of the object suggests it was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.52","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leamington Hastings","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC8EAEE7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"14.93"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
