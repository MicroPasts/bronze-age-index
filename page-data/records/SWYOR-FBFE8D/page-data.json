The blade is very worn and only part of the cutting edge survives. In profile the fragment tapers to the cutting edge. The breaks are uneven and patinated, but not worn. The object has a heavily pitted green and mottled brown patinated surface. It is 33.8mm long, 37.1mm wide and 9.9mm thick. 37.1g.\n\n\n\nCompare KENT-A1066C, SUR-0A7938 and SUR-E28B29.
