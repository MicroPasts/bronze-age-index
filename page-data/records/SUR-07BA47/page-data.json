Other Bronze Age bag-shaped chapes are just a bit more pointed at the top and they are often decorated with a groove or moulding or mouth moulding or even punched circlets, but this example is very plain.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"April 14, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"18.03","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/margaretb/East Stratton 15.4.12 111.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"30.37"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
