Approximately one third of the axehead is represented by this piece.  The thinned blade edge survives and flares out at each side.  Before the broken edge, there are slight flanges on the edges of the axehead.  It has been suggested that Bronze Age axes were sometimes sacrificially killed (cut into pieces).  The fragment is 32.4mm long,, 36.2mm wide and 8.8mm thick.
