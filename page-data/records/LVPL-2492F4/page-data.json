The surface is very worn and some surface corrosion is visible. The patina is uneven, mostly green but with some yellow/white and grey patches. One side is much more worn than the other. All the edges are broken and worn, the breaks are old. \n\nOnly the middle part, where the flange and the blade meet is present. The septum is present on both sides and is a fairly deep recess where it meets the blade. The top of the blade has a central raised line which could be either shield pattern, early mid-ribbed or low flanged type but due to wear and the the break it is not possible to narrow it down further. This line is only present on one side, this is due to wear. \n\nThis type of axe dates from the Mid-Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"53.063953","fourFigureLon":"-2.553584","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Acton","county":"Cheshire East","district":"Cheshire East","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fmcintosh/palstave axe frag.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Liverpool","length":"67"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
