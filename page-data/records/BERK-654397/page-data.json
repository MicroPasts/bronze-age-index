The chisel has a hollow body which has been cast in two pieces, with the cast lines still visible down either edge. The chisel has a thin flanged blade and a sub-circular socket that extends only 7.74mm down into the body - suggesting that this object has been reworked from a longer gouge. The chisel is in very good condition and has a nice even olive green patina.\n\nThe chisel is 51.74mm long with the blade measuring 21.92mm wide. The socket is 15.42mm in diameter and the object weighs 17.8gms.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"It has been suggested that these small tools may have been used in leather working (Evans 1881).","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"February 12, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"15.42","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/Benning BA chisel.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"51.74"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
