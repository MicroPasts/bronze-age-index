Cast axe head with crescentic cutting edge, a slightly tapered lower blade and a broad body with a square mouth of internal dimensions 26mm by 29mm by 58mm deep.

Externally, three low ribs run from the socket towards the blade on either side, and a loop springs from a prominent collar moulding below the mouth. Heavily abraded though still complete.
