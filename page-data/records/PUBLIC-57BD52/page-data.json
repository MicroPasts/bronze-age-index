It is sub-oval in plan, unevenly concave on its upper surface and convex on its underside representing the depression in the clay or other mould material which was filled with molten metal. Projecting from the convex underside is the remaining short stub of an irregularly-shaped runner. There is possibly the remains of another runner, represented now by just a slight oval bump on the underside next to the existing runner. The jet has an uneven, irregular surface with an even, mid-green-brown patina.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length 16.34mm: Width 13.28mm: Thickness 9.56mm: Weight 6.38g\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Another casting jet dating to the Bronze-Age is also recorded from the same site LIN-0735F7","fourFigureLat":"53.4437402","fourFigureLon":"0.01604987","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Redmayne","datefound1":"February 04, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Redmayne","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.56","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fulstow","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tomredmayne/2018_0604_152623AA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"16.34"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
