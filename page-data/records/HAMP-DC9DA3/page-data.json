The object consists of the abraded blade tip, that tapers to a rounded point. All of the edges have been abraded and broken to a greater or lesser extent. The break is broadly straight. The edges of the blade are bevelled while a central section is flat; the cross-section at the break has the appearance of an elongated hexagon. Where it survives the metal has a dark-brown patina; underlying this it is a corroded mid-green colour. One surface has been iron stained.","fourFigureLat":"52.13979","fourFigureLon":"-0.58405","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"April 24, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"2.2","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stagsden","county":"Bedford","district":"Bedford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-DC9DA3blade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"18.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
