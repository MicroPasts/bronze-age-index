The fragment is approximately the last 6cm of the spear. It has a narrow, prominent midrib with a sharply-humped, oval cross section. The broken end of the spear tip shows that there is a circular hole, somewhat off-centre of the midribs, indicating that this was a socketed spearhead and therefore of a later date than the solid, tanged spearheads. The blade wings are thin and quite narrow with a small edge bevel. In profile they flare from the tip with a straight, narrow shape indicating that this spearhead was more likely to be triangular-bladed than with a leaf-shaped blade. The whole has an even, tactile, dark red-brown patina over its surface. Much of the original surface remains.
