The remains consist of the blade and a small portion of the body of the axehead. There do not appear to be any traces of a socket, indicating that it is probably not a socketed axe from the later Bronze Age. The blade is slightly flared and crescent shaped, perhaps suggesting that the axehead is either a flanged or palstave type of middle Bronze Age date. The axehead has an abraded green/brown coloured patina. There are areas of active corrosion on the object.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 44.6 mm long, 29 mm wide at the blade, 7.3 mm thick and weighs 40.78 grams","fourFigureLat":"52.3893444","fourFigureLon":"-1.36958355","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Victoria Allnatt","datefound1":"January 01, 2017","datefound2":"January 15, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brandon and Bretford","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vallnatt/WMIDF2E776.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"44.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
