A moderate double twist at a point where the rod is bent appears to be a deliberate feature, but elsewhere very slight twists are likely to be due to distortion.

Twisting is a regular feature of Middle Bronze Age gold bar ornaments in Britain and Ireland, and in general this may offer the best context. Although most commonly of square section, such ornaments can occasionally have a triangular section (Eogan 1994, 53-7). Also unusual is the intermittent nature of the twisting, but very occasional parallels can be found. It is possible that intermittent twisting may in some cases indicate that an ornament had not been finished. The hoard from Cappeen, Co Cork, is particularly relevant to the Risby-cum-Roxby fragment in containing these two unusual features, albeit on separate objects: a fully twisted neckring of triangular section and an intermittently twisted bracelet, or rod, of square-section (Eogan 1994, 63 fig. 27A).\n\n\n\nThis can be accepted as a probable fragment from a Bronze Age ornament, although not necessarily from a finished piece. Consequently, in terms of age and as the item contains a minimum of 10% gold it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr S.P.
