The butt is rounded, but may be eroded and has a width of 22.71mm. The sides are straight and fairly parallel with a maximum width at the break of 24.64mm. The casting seams are prominent on both sides. The flanges begin before the butt and rise to a maximum surviving height of 15.00mm. The septum is flat and tapers to the butt, with a thickness at the break of 7.1mm. Air bubbles are evident in the bronze at the break and may have caused a weakness, resulting in the fracture. The fragment has poor surface preservation, but where the surface survives it has a black patina, elsewhere the fragment is pale to mid green.","fourFigureLat":"51.501237","fourFigureLon":"-3.427673","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006262.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"37.69"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
