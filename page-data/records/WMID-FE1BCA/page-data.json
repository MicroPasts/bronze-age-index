The chape has an oval opening, concave sides and a rounded base. The opening is chipped along one edge and broken away into the body id the chape on the opposing side. The surface is corroded, with a double-ribbed collar running circumferentially just below the opening, and possible inscised circular decoration on the more degraded face of the object.\n\n\n\nA similar, more complete, example can be seen is Leahy and Lewis (2018: 332) from Rockbourne in Hampshire. Other comparable chapes recorded on the PAS database include: HAMP-095061; NARC-5DEF37; and DOR-BD9AED. Webley (2005) states that this type of chape is associated with the 'carp's tongue complex' of south-east England and dates to the Ewart Park metalworking phase.\n\n\n\nThe overall dimensions are as follows: 22.58mm in length, 31.86mm in width, 9.53mm in thickness and 12.43g in weight.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nWebley, R (2005) NARC-5DEF37: A BRONZE AGE SCABBARD\n\n\n\nWeb page available at: https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/97000\n\n\n\n[Accessed: 30 May 2019 14:53:27]","fourFigureLat":"52.55257432","fourFigureLon":"-2.25215405","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.53","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Trysull and Seisdon","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sburford/WMIDFE1BCA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"22.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
