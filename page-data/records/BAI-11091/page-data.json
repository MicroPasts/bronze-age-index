Georef not working for me. The stuff in Surface looks as though some of it should perhaps be in Description & Patina fields.  There's lots more detail on the back of the card - see below. Bottom left of card says \"MJR\". There's quite a lot written beside diagram, but bits of it are missing from this copy. Note 1 - I think a first Heading might have been \"BLADE\", but that it has been cut off in the copying process. I'm Not sure if the second heading is RIDGE, or whether a \"B\" has been cut off and it should be BRIDGE. Note 2 - I presume some of the para. nos. have also been chopped off in the copying process, but context indicates what they must be. I have put the missing paragraph numbers back in or it won't make sense. It all reads as follows:,  \"1) Blade body short and [...] sided. Almost square. Curves sharply out to blade edge., 2) Marked recurved wings,3) presence of bevel - high [...] on blade face c. 2.6 cms from edge,4) Blade section - rectangular,5)  Sides squared,6)No signs of hammerwork,RIDGE:, 1) Hammered feature having been raised up under the flanges,2) Raised level (bevel?) with flanges, which are bent over the ends of the stop.,3 Stop is at an angle, sloping in towards septum. St. face to septum.,4)Bevelled top with straight face to blade.,5) Socket shape rectang, with inturned flanges giving it a waisted appearance.,6) flat floor to socket with [...]-sided inturned flanges,7) Flanges: a) leaf-shaped, extending for c. 1cm below stop. Hammered down. b) Flanges are slightly faceted along the inbent edges,CONDITION: Blade edge shattered, surface pitting extensive,PATINA: dark brown. shows signs of rust patina.\"","composition":"","associations":"","publications":"","inputBy":"Jane Fellows","imageURL":"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3875/14792144570_d674537976_b.jpg","flickrURL":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/MicroPasts/14792144570","project":"flangedAxesA1","rightCorner":"","collection":"Cambridge, University Museum, Z. 4258","site":"England,Cambs.,Bottisham","toSearch":"","gridRef":"","dateDiscoveryDay":"NA","dateDiscoveryMonth":"NA","dateDiscoveryYear":"NA","remarks":"","museumCollection":"MAA Cambridge","museumID":"Z. 4258","collectionIdentifier":"","stolenStatus":"","imageCopyrightHolder":null,"length":"109"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
