The dagger has a surviving length of 67.9mm and has a weight of 8.9g. The butt would have had two rivet-holes for hafting; the better preserved rivet hole has a diameter of 3.0mm. The butt has broken through both rivet-holes and the surviving area of the butt is straight and thin with a thickness of 0.5mm. The dagger has a maximum surviving width of 31.4mm. The midrib is widest at the butt (10mm) and gradually narrows with curved sides to the tip. The dagger has a maximum thickness of 2.0mm. Either side of the midrib the blade is gently concave before the blade facets. The blade facets have a width of 3.5mm. The blade edges were straight and convergent to the tip, producing a triangular form to the dagger. The dagger has good surface preservation with a dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.401884","fourFigureLon":"-1.814509","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"All Early Bronze Age knife-daggers recorded by Gerloff (1975, p170) were found associated with cremation burials beneath barrows within the Wessex Culture area.
