The gouge consists of the rectangular shaped blade tip. It is possible that this gouge was socket, however there is no indication of a socket remaining. The blade is C-shaped in cross-section throughout its length and concave, with the hollow of the blade increasing towards the cutting-edge. The sides of the blade are parallel and the cutting-edge is rounded and there is a visible casting-seam present on one side of the object. The break is semi-circular in cross-section and the reverse of the gouge is rounded.\n\n\n\nThe gouge measures 38.3 mm in length, 13.9 mm wide, 10.3 mm thick and weighs 20.95 g.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of similar objects recorded on the database including LIN-F1C06A and a socketed example IOW-EC25A7. If this gouge was socketed, it is likely that this tool is from the Wilberton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking phases which correspond to Needham's (1996) Period's 6 - 8. Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11).","fourFigureLat":"51.23861413","fourFigureLon":"0.96404566","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Chestnutt","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Chestnutt","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chilham","county":"Kent","district":"Ashford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cchestnutt/KENT8B55F1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"38.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
