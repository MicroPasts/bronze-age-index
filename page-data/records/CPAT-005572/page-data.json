The mouth of the socket is sub-rectangular with a single square form moulding at the top edge, beneath that is an attachment loop, now broken.  In plan view, the axe has parallel sides that are then subtly flared to give the blade form.  The blade edge appears worn and is now showing signs of corrosion.\n\n\nThe lower surfaces of the blade have scratches perpendicular to a cutting action and to one side.\n\n\nThe overall impression is that this axe is from the Hallstatt A2 phase, perhaps Wilburton in its simplistic yet elegant style.   The axe has a pleasant dark green patina with some iron staining; there is also a small casting flaw to the narrow side, opposite the loop.","fourFigureLat":"53.096852","fourFigureLon":"-3.016968","fromdate":"1100","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"August 19, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llay","county":"Wrexham","district":"Wrexham","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2827-0017.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"84.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
