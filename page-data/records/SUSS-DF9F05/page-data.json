The axehead has a narrow round-ended damaged butt, which widens into a sub-triangular axehead in plan, with very worn dual-facetted flanges. The blade-end is wide and convex, but not crescentic with pointed ends, like other types from the same period. The blade-end has a pointed oval cross-section, whereas the body of the blade is facetted, creating an elongated hexagonal cross-section; the butt is sub-rectangular in cross-section. The axehead has an overall dark green patina. No regular decoration is visible. Parallels for the form can be found in Schmidt & Burgess's Developed Flat Axe series (1981, 59-68).\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 67.8mm long, 15.7mm wide (at butt-end), 31.4mm wide (at blade-end), 2.8mm thick (at butt-end), 2mm thick (at blade-end),9.4mm thick (at centre); weight: 63.79 grams.\n\n\n\nA similar axehead is recorded on the PAS data base: SUSS-4D7454.","fourFigureLat":"51.06945493","fourFigureLon":"-0.55986411","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1500","notes":"Reference: Schmidt, P., and Burgess, C. 1981.
