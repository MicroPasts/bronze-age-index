The top of the axe has broken or is eroded, probably just below the mouth. The mouth is oval to sub-rectangular (31.4mm wide and 25.1mm deep). The socket is rectangular (21.7mm x 13.6mm and 36.8mm deep) and when reported, contained the distorted wooden remains, probably of the handle. After the removal of the wood, no internal ribs were identified at the base of the socket. The poor preservation of the wood has made it difficult to obtain a species identification. There is a horizontal collar moulding, now heavily worn, positioned at the top of the loop. The loop has mostly been lost, with only the basal stubs now surviving (with a length of 17.0mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and appear to have been finished. The sides are near-straight, only very gently concave and parallel for approximately half their lengths before diverging to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (with a width of 37.1mm). The axe has an oval to sub-rectangular body section (31.0mm x 16mm below the loop) without any facets. The faces are convex across their widths and comparatively flat across their lengths, converging more sharply above the blade but without a discernible blade facet. The original surface has been lost and is striped and heavily-pitted with a pale-green corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.77426864","fourFigureLon":"-5.11782427","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"The truncated mouth makes precise typological identification difficult. The axe has the 'baggy' form, of types well represented in Ireland. The axe would appear to best fit Eogan's (2000, p 20-30) Class 2 A or B with a suggested date range from the 11th to 9th centuries BC (ibid, p 30). Axes of type 2 have a distribution largely in the northern half of Ireland, although examples are recorded from as far south as Cork (ibid. pl. 113B).\n\n\n\n1.
