The bracelet is formed from a single bar of copper alloy that has been twisted to create a spiralling effect around much of its length. Towards the two terminal ends the wire is not twisted and instead is a short length of rectangular section. The terminals are hooked allowing the bracelet to be joined together. The wire terminates in a point on each terminal hook. Althogh now slightly distorted, it is evident that the closed diameter of the bracelet would have been very small.\n\n\n\nSpiral torcs are known from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400-1200 BC) and twisted wire torcs and cabled bracelets from the Iron Age and Roman periods, however the form of this example suggests an early date. No direct comparison for the small size can be found on the PAS database nor in the usual literature however twisted torcs are a well-known artefact of the 'Ornament Horizon' period of the Middle Bronze Age. Of example recorded with the PAS there are two recently discovered spiral torcs from Hampshire (SUR-9A711C), while a much grander example from Wiltshire shows the skill of the manufacturers (WILT-12B9D2). The 'Near Lewes' hoard also exhibits a complete spiral torc (SUSS-C5D042). They all have the untwisted sections before hooked terminals. The example recorded herein is of much cruder workmanship when compared to other examples.","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"August 22, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"57.7","edge":null,"thickness":"2.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017073.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"57.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
