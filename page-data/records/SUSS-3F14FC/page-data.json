The axehead has trapezoidal sides and in profile, the fragment tapers to the crescentic cutting edge which is complete and very worn. The object has a heavily pitted green and mottled brown patinated surface.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: length: 47.86mm; width at cutting edge: 48.36mm; thickness at break: 9.61mm and weight: 92.41g. \n\n\n\nThe missing butt makes the axeheads's type ambiguous. It may be a flat axe, missing only a small part of its length or a Palstave missing a large part of its blade and then the entire haft and flanges. The thinness of the blade suggests it is probably a flat axe and the relatively straight sides and only minor blade expansion best fits Needham's (1996) type 2D and 3C axeheads dating 2300-2050 cal BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.07808907","fourFigureLon":"-0.53104467","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.61","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Loxwood","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS3F14FCb.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"47.86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
