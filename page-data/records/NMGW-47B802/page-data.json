The butt is straight and thin (with a width of 17mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The sides are near-straight and parallel as far as the position of the bevel on the faces (where the axe has a width of 21.6mm, a thickness of 11.5mm and a maximum depth, including flanges of 14.9mm). The sides are decorated with diagonal ridges and are slightly convex and gently rounded across their depths. Below the stop the sides widen gradually before the recurved blade tips (with a blade width of 50.3mm and a blade depth of 21.2mm). The blade edge is crescentic but slightly straightened around its centre, possibly because of wear. The flanges begin just below the butt and have a regular curve before returning to the on the blade. The flanges are comparatively shallow (reaching a maximum height above the septum of 2.6mm). The septum gradually thickens linearly to the position of the bevel (66mm below the butt), which has a slight curve. Beneath the bevel, decorative ridges echo the bevel at the top of the blade. The decoration is only now partially preserved where there is surface preservation but the decoration is likely to have been contained between the flanges on the top of the blade (for 18mm below the stop). The faces of the blade gradually converge towards the edge and slightly convex across their lengths. The surface has patches with a dark-brown patina, with pale-brown areas of surface loss with some both green and blue corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe height of the flanges (above 1.5mm) and overall form of the axe means it can be confidently classed as a low-flanged axe, datable to the Arreton assemblage (c.1725-1500 cal. BC)/Period 4 of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997). The axe can be classed as Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 72-75) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming\n\n\n\nNeedham (1983, 198) lists 179 Class 5 axes from southern Britain, indicating the broad currency of this axe type. In Wales, approximately 26 examples are currently known from both hoards and isolated contexts, with recent discoveries rapidly changing the image of how these axes were circulated. Class 5 axes are present in hoards from Menai Bridge, Anglesey (Savory 1980, 115, No.259), Llanover, Monmouthshire (NMGW-3F3BBC) and Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0B9997).
