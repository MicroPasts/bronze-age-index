The butt (with a width of 21.4mm and a thickness of 2.5mm) is moderately straight and is likely to have suffered some erosion. The sides are straight and divergent as far as the blade (where the axe has a width of 28.1mm). The cast flanges appear to begin just before the butt and are convex across their heights (reaching a maximum surviving height of 20.8mm) and appear to have had a regular curve, producing an oval side profile. The septum appears moderately flat with no surviving evidence for a median bevel. The sides are 'nicked' (with a width of 32.0mm and a thickness of 10.5mm) immediately below the flanges, below which the sides are concave and divergent to the blade edge. The casting seams are no longer evident. One of the blade tips has been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 53.5mm). There is no decorative device now evident on either blade face. The blade faces are gently convex across their widths, with the possible suggestion of a mid-ridge and are flat and convergent across their lengths before converging more sharply to the blade edge but without discernible blade facets. The surface is very poorly preserved with a small remnants surviving on the septum and blade with a dark-brown patina; elsewhere the surface has corroded pale-to mid-green and brown.\n\n\n\nThe loss of subtle surface features makes typological identification difficult, the general form however is consistent with Type Kirtomy, Early Short Flanged axes and the noticeable nicked sides may suggest the variant Arnhall.\n\n\n\n1.
