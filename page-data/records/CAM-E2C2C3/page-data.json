The fragment comprises a small portion of the blade and tang. The blade is rectangular in shape and lentoidal in section. It possesses a central vertical ridge along its length. A corroded rectangular tang extends from one end. The fragment measures 41mm in length and a maximum of 23mm in width. A similar, but larger example, is illustrated by A. Macgregor (1987; pp. 110; no. 11.72), who states that knives cut from larger pieces are relatively common in this period.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philippa Walton","datefound1":"March 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philippa Walton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Papworth Everard","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"South Cambridgeshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
