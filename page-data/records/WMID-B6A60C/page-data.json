The base, blade and point are missing, presumed lost in antiquity.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead fragment is a hollow sub conical tube. At the top, the base of the blade is present. Below this, on both sides are 5 small horizontal grooves. The side loops are positioned underneath these grooves, and would have been sub lozenge in shape. The top of the socket is circular.\n\n\n\nIt measures 47.3 mm in length. It has a minimum diameter of 11.0 mm (top) and a maximum of 15.0 mm (base). The side loops have a length of 17.5 mm. The walls of the spearhead are 1.9 mm thick. It weighs 16.5 g.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead fragment is a mid to dark brown with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nA similar spearhead has been recorded on the PAS database as HESH-C348E5 and is considered to be Middle Bronze Age in dating (1500 BC to 1150 BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.6964746","fourFigureLon":"-1.77948442","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"November 16, 2014","datefound2":"November 16, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"15","edge":null,"thickness":"1.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fradley and Streethay","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMIDB6A60C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"47.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
