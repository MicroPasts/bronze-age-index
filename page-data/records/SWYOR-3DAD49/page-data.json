The butt is narrow and incomplete and measures 21.8mm in width and is 3.8mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than having cast flanges. The flanges extend 1.0 mm above the body of the axe head. The expanded blade measures 39.6mm in width and is 2.5 mm thick at the break.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 85.4mm in length, has a maximum width of 39.6mm (blade), a minimum width 21.8mm (butt), and has a width of 28.3mm in the centre. It is 10.8mm thick at the central point. It weighs 118.1g\n\n\n\nThe axehead is green, with a corroded and pitted surface.\n\n\n\nThis axehead is similar to those WMID-F20D62 and is consistent with that of the Arreton type axe, of Early Bronze Age III dating, metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.\n\n\n\nThe finder has had element analysis done on the axe. The results are Cu 38.79%, Sn 35.06%, Si 15.93%, Al 4.86%, Fe 3.87%, P 1.21% Zn 0.18% and Pb 0.101%.","fourFigureLat":"53.78998089","fourFigureLon":"-1.10591573","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"August 31, 2017","datefound2":"September 29, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Selby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Selby","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR3DAD49BronzeAgeAxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"85.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
