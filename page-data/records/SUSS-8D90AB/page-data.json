The fragment comprises the upper tip of the arrowhead, which has a rounded midrib and broken outer edges; the fragment is triangular in plan with an asymmetrical pointed oval cross-section.  The fragment has a dark brown, glossy patina.  No trace of the socket is visible on this fragment, but it is likely if the object was socketed it would begin further down the original object. The arrowhead measures 24.7mm long, 11.3mm wide, 5.9mm thick and weighs 3.91 grams.\n\n\n\nThere are few confirmed Bronze Age socketed arrowheads found in the UK; possible examples on the PAS database include SF9209, WMID-28FC66 and SWYOR-C57356. Like the example recorded here, it is possible that all of these pieces are small spearheads rather than arrowheads - see, for example, database record BH-E94CD1.","fourFigureLat":"52.65047129","fourFigureLon":"0.96995502","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Liz Walker","datefound1":"November 10, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stephanie Smith","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Yaxham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS8D90AB.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"24.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
