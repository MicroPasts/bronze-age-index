The end of the tang has a separate, circular-sectioned rivet with slightly expanded ends (28.0mm long and 6.6 - 8.1mm diameter and up to 8.8mm diameter for the ends) remaining in-place. The end of the tang is rounded (with a width of 14.1mm, a thickness of 2.3mm and positioned 3mm from the rivet). The tang is rectangular sectioned with near straight sides, slightly narrower above the rivet and gradually thickening towards the blade (with a minimum width of 11.4mm and a maximum thickness of 9.5mm). The blade has bevelled shoulders to give a maximum width near the base (of 42.1mm and a blade length of 156mm). Little of the original blade edge survives but they appear to have been straight and gradually converging to the tip. The spearhead faces have median bevels, giving a lozenge section (with a maximum thickness near the base of 10.7mm). The blade faces are stepped parallel to the edge (7mm from the edge) with an additional blade facet discernible in the better preserved area (2mm from the edge). No applied decoration is evident on the spearhead and there are no sharpening striations discernible. The surface has a mid-green patina with a dark green and blue (possibly azurite) corrosion, some of which appears to be active.\n\n\n\nAnalysis to ascertain the composition of the metal of both the spearhead and the rivet was attempted using X-ray fluorescence, the results are not semi-quantitative but indicate that the spearhead alloy is an arsenical bronze, while the rivet is a tin bronze with only trace arsenic levels . It is unclear whether different alloys were used for practical reasons or whether the two parts were made at different times.\n\n\n\nTanged spearheads are not a commonly recovered artefact type, with seemingly only four other recorded examples from Wales. Two of the four tanged spearheads were recovered from Penllyn , indicating a highly-significant local clustering for the type. The other two spearheads are from Ystradyfodwg, Rhondda (Savory, 1980, no. 225, p. 111) and from Llanfachreth, Gwynedd (Savory, 1980, no. 336, p. 132). The Glamorgan tanged spearheads are of a similar form to this example but are generally decorated. The Gwynedd spearhead is of a more squat form.\n\n\n\n1.
