The axe is incomplete, missing the mouth and upper body (with a surviving length of 66.1mm and a weight of 77.3g). The body of the axe is slender (with a minimum surviving width at the break of 24.2mm). The sides of the axe are concave and expand at the blade to produce a moderately curved blade. The loop is not present on the incomplete axe. The casting flashes on the sides are not discernible and the axe is well-finished. The sides of the faces have weak, rounded facets producing a sub-octagonal body profile (with a maximum surviving thickness of 12.9mm). The blade edge and the blade tips have been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 42.2mm). Both faces of the axe are plain and slightly convex across their lengths. One of the faces has been crushed against the other, closing the socket. The damage was done by a bladed tool or weapon, as evidenced by a linear scar (6.8mm long) at the base of a V-shaped indentation. The other face has the suggestion of pounding marks at the same level. The axe has good surface preservation with a mid to dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.932852","fourFigureLon":"-3.426789","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brecon","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.138.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"66.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
