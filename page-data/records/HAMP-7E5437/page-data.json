The object has moderately concave sides and flares from a width of 6mm at the butt to 56mm at the blade. The side profile lacks a lenticular profile and the cross section appears entirely flat; this may be due to the extensive corrosion loss which has also removed any blade edges and sides. A stop bevel may be present, this has again been corroded to the extent where it is difficult to see.\n\n\n\nCf.
