The fragment consists of only the very tip of the spearhead, but it is in excellent condition. It has a narrow and slender tip with a pronounced midrib on both faces which is triangular in section. The tapering wings have slight edge bevels. The wing edges are still sharp, the the rib is also angular enough to feel crisp, and to form a sharp point. The break at the wider end is patinated. The part that survives has straight sides. The patina is almost black, and is smooth and glossy with longitudinal striations. Although only a fragment of the spearhead survives, the narrowness of the blade, and the extent of the midrib (to the tip of the blade) suggest it might be classified as no earlier than Davis Group 6 (2017).","fourFigureLat":"53.489024","fourFigureLon":"-0.645021","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Carole Bloom","datefound1":"January 01, 2012","datefound2":"January 31, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carole Bloom","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.64","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Scotter","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1790_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"36.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
