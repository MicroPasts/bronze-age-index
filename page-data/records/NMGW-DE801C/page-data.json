The suggested hilt part is wider and marginally thinner (with a maximum surviving width of 22.8mm and a thickness of 2.0mm). The blade edge does not survive on either side (with a minimum surviving width of 15.5mm, where it has a thickness of 2.8mm). A sub-circular notch may possibly be the remains of a rivet attachment hole.  However, only one face only has a midrib (12mm wide), the other face is flat and featureless. The surface is poorly preserved with remnants of a dark-brown patina, consistent with Bronze Age metalwork from the area; elsewhere the surface has a grey-green corrosion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmented and corroded state make any identification tentative; the form is consistent with Bronze Age blades, possibly reworked although one flat side is difficult to understand but may relate to its reworking.","fourFigureLat":"51.42135531","fourFigureLon":"-3.33888791","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llancarfan","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.195.2jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"24.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
