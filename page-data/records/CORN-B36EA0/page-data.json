Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the exposed sides of the fragment have worn cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and a few lighter green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, plate 36, no.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar plano-convex ingot from Churston Ferrers in Devon on page 79, pl.6, no.123b recorded in DEV-D9F1E2 (2011T441) which are dated from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.13776804","fourFigureLon":"-5.41600381","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"April 30, 2018","datefound2":"December 31, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"34","diameter":"120","edge":null,"thickness":"34","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Erth","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8175.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"66"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
