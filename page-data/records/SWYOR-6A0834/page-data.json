Only the socket survives, so the shape of the blade is unknown. There are side loops half way along the socket which is circular in section. Most of one side of the socket is missing, and one of the loops is broken. It has a dark grey green patina. The socket is slightly tapering, suggesting that the fragment might be classified as Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'.","fourFigureLat":"53.097611","fourFigureLon":"-1.075528","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"May 31, 2010","datefound2":"September 09, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Farnsfield","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Newark and Sherwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1235_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"58.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
