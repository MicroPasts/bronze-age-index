One section blade tapers to a broken tip with broadly parallel edges. The other section is wider and bent at one end. Each has a tapered cutting edge on both sides. There is a flattened central rib on both faces the length of the blade, measuring approximately 9.81mm, giving a shallow lentoid cross section. Examination of the break sections, particularly the break at which the two sections join, show casting flaws in the form of hollows (or bubbles). \n\n\n\nThe blade has a patchy green brown patina.\n\n\n\nDimensions: One section measures 128.35mm in length, is 17.70mm wide, 4.81mm thick and weighs 52.2g. The other is 101.45mm long, tapers from 17.37mm to 10.29mm in width, is 4.86mm thick and weighs 28.5g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The blade is comparable in some respects to Bronze Age blades, such as those described BERK-227481 and KENT-FE8716, but the central ridge on this find seems less prominent and the blade is thicker throughout. The bend and break shows similarities to rapier DOR-2A928E, which was also broken in antiquity prior to deposition. Following the blade cross-section scheme of classification set out by Burgess & Gerloff 1981 (in O'Connor et al. 1995, 347)  the blade under discussion here (2020-T354 / DUR-7A57CC) is a Group IV rapier, with slightly rounded cross-section characteristic of the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age \"with a floruit around the 13th/12th centuries cal BC (c.1275-1140BC)\n\n\n\nAuthor: Benjamin Westwood, Finds Liaison Officer for Durham, Darlington & Teesside\n\n\n\nDate: 24/06/2020\n\n\n\nReferences:        \n\n\n\nO’Connor, B., Cowie, T., O’Neil, M., 1995.
