The blade is flat with a very thin lenticular cross section a slight mid-rib and cutting edges on either side. The patina is even and dark green.\n\n\n\nThe single hole and very thin section allow an interpretation as a razor or perhaps a small knife rather than part of a dirk or other type of larger bladed implement.","fourFigureLat":"51.22073082","fourFigureLon":"-1.41430842","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"See DOR-EBFA4D, SUR-E3AEB2 or SF-25A20A for comparable objects on the database.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hurstbourne Priors","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURB3BDBB.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"39.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
