The gouge is in good condition with an even green patina.\n\n\nThe socketed end is 17mm in diameter. The gouge is 92mm long, and the flared blade end is 14mm wide.\n\n\nTwo similar examples are illustrated in Watson, P, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', BAR British Series 233.\n\n\nAccording to Pearce, S, M in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Ben Roberts of the British Museum has kindly lokoed at his gouge and agrees with the function and date of the object.","fourFigureLat":"52.172116","fourFigureLon":"-1.138697","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Cassidy","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Cassidy","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Preston Capes","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jcassidy/NARC-5D5F57 a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"92"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
