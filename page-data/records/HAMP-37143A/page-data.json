The object is perhaps of Bronze Age date (2,500-800 BC) and related to gold ornaments/ strips known from the Bronze Age of Southern England.\n\nBoth faces of the object retain traces of decoration in the form of numerous longitudinally-arranged raised ridges of rectangular section, parallel to each other. It isn't possible to determine what the reverse of the sheet-gold looks like.\n\nTo one edge of the object the sheet is unbroken/ undamaged on the rounded part, while the other edge is damaged. The narrower part above has jagged edges that are not joined.\n\nThe rounded end has a max.width of 10.4mm and a max.thickness of 2.1mm. The narrower strip above is max.6.8mm wide, narrowing to 4.8mm at the open end (both faces of the object are folded over at the very end). The piercing visible in one face only is 0.8mm in diameter and pierced from front to the reverse. It is possible there may be a matching piercing on the other face of the object and that this is now concealed by the fold.\n\nThe object measures 14.9mm in length, 10.4mm in max.width, 2.9mm in max.thickness (at the jagged edges of the narrower section) and weighs 0.76g. The sheet gold is 0.2mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"51.22702945","fourFigureLon":"-1.01323871","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"October 10, 2018","datefound2":"October 10, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upton Grey","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP37143A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"14.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
