The object can be classified as fitting into the Ewart Park phase of metalwork.\n\n\n\nThe axe is sub-rectangular in plan with the cutting edge expanding outwards. The cutting edge of the axe is missing and the break is patinated, though perhaps to a less extent than the rest of the axe. The broken edges are not worn. This break may be intentional and may indicate ritual deposition.\n\n\n\nThe socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 29.22mm, internal length 28mm, external width 40.5mm, external length 39.3mm and the wall of the mouth is 5 - 5.7mm thick). The socket is over 78mm deep and the insides are smooth. Four casting runners can be felt round the edeg of the mouth.\n\n\n\nA moulded collar decorates the axe about 15mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs on each of the two main faces, measuring 25mm - 30mm in length and about 2mm wide.\n\n\n\nAlong the centre of each side of the axe is a trimmed but raised casting seam. The seams have not been filed down. One side of the axe has a large semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 10.5mm in width and 22mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section.\n\n\n\nThe axe has a mid green to dark grey patina and the surface is smooth. Overall, the axe is 77.9mm long, 42.4mm wide and 39.3mm thick. 164g.\n\n\n\nThe object can be classified as belonging to the Ewart park phase of metal work which corresponds with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC. This axe is likely to date from about 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.79328072","fourFigureLon":"-0.52896491","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"November 01, 2014","datefound2":"February 12, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"39.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rowley","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2493_socketed_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"77.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
