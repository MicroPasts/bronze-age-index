The lozenge-shaped flanges start a short way in from the butt corners; all of the flanges have been slightly bent backwards. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body. There is no obvious stop ridge for the handle to butt against although there is a not very pronounced curved stop on the main body just above the lower end of the wings. The blade is thicker than the septum and tapers in thickness to the crescent shaped blade with slightly upturned points. The edge of the blade is slightly chipped on one side. There are rough casting seams down the sides of the object from the pointed apex of the flanges to the points of the blade. There is no evidence of any decoration on the axe head. The patina is generally of a dark green colour with some dark brown patches.\n\n\n\nLength: 129.5 mm\n\nWidth: 36.94 mm\n\nThickness: 14.4 mm\n\nWeight: 305 g\n\n\n\nSeveral examples of flanged axe heads can be found on the database although the types differ with small changes in shape, the closest parallel being LANCUM -F0B1FD which states that \"This is quite a large, common group and part of the Taunton Metalwork Assemblage, dating from c. 1300 - 1200 BC\". This axehead thus belongs to a group of Later Short Flanged axes, Lissett Type (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981,100;  plate 48, numbers 616-620).\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K., Burgess, C., 1981.
