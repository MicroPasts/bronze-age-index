The object is in fair condition with a green patina and weighs 51.76 grams. The object, especially the tip, is quite worn which suggests it may have been broken in use? It consists of a rounded cutting edge and tapering sides, 27mm long. The break is uneven and it shows that the axes internal thickness is also uneven. Around the sub rectangular recess the axe has a thickness of 7mm on one edge whilst the rest of the axe is about 4mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"53.37811078","fourFigureLon":"-1.35508246","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"June 04, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Treeton","county":"Rotherham","district":"Rotherham","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/DSCN1723.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
