The object is in incredibly poor condition and thus undiagnostic. It appears to have a central ridge, widening towards the lower end of the object, though no trace of a socket is visible. The original shape of the object is uncertain due to corrosion and damage.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavil (Finds Liaison Officer, Herefordshire & Shropshire) suggests the object may be a spearhead or a rapier blade, though based on the section of the object it is more likely to be a spearhead. In either case it would likely date from 1500 to 1150 BC.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 26.05 mm; width: 15.48 mm; thickness: 6.62 mm; weight: 13.83g.","fourFigureLat":"51.92077994","fourFigureLon":"0.2088706","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"B.
