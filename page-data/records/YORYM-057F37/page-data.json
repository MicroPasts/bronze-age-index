South Wales (Stogursey) Type and of Ewart Park Metalworking Industry of Needham's (1997) Period 7.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is wedge-shaped with a square socket mouth and a moulded everted collar. The remains of four runners / casting jets in the form of raised ovate knops are present - being positioned at the mid-point of each side of the mouth. Internally the socket is wedge shaped - it tapers and narrows to the cutting edge. Externally the sides of the axehead are broadly parallel before expanding to form a crescentic shaped blade with distinct blade tips. On the upper part of the socket is a D-shaped, ovate sectioned attachment loop it is positioned directly below the swollen collar. Casting flashes are present on both sides of the axehead including the loop and a crack is present along one corner. The flashes have been trimmed and hammered flat. Likewise the blade is prepared and sharpened - suggesting the axe was in a condition where it would have been usable.Three distinct vertical ribs are present on the two widest surfaces of the axehead, these commence from the underside of the moulded collar and taper to blunt points on the lower blade before the cutting facet of the axe.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a largely shiny reddish/brown patina with some green patches on the blade. The area around the socket is slightly blackened while the ribs retain a brassy shine. Peter Reavill Finds Liaison Officer - Herefordshire & Shropshire comments that this is a common feature with the axes seemingly dipped or deliberately blackened, and the ribs then polished resulting in a shiny gold on black effect.\n\n\n\nDimensions:\n\n\n\nLength: 112.9mm;\n\n\n\nSocket (external): 53.4mm x 44.9mm;\n\n\n\nSocket (internal): 30.7mm x 27.9mm;\n\n\n\nBlade width: 59.5mm;\n\n\n\nLoop: 30.5mm x 7.6mm x 5.4mm;\n\n\n\nInternal depth: 80.1mm;\n\n\n\nWeight: 403g.\n\n\n\nNMGW-718725 states that South Wales axes and their variants are prolific in south east Wales with over 120 examples now known as single finds and from within hoards. Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).\n\n\n\nRecently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800 CAL BC (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996)","fourFigureLat":"51.82237311","fourFigureLon":"-2.72684566","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Monmouth","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/SWW0001.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"112.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
