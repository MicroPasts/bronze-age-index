The fragment has undulating original edges and more recently broken edges which reveal voids within the waste. The original edges are rounded whereas the broken edge is quite angular and is a fresh break. The surfaces of the fragment are slightly undulating with one face having traces of a heavy patina and a turquoise/blue corrosion product. The other face has patches of a mid green patina. It weighs 62.5g and measures 59.7mm long and 34.56mm wide. \n\nThe date is uncertain, but the turquoise/blue corrosion product has been seen only on Bronze Age material from this area, so is perhaps of a Bronze Age date. The site it has been found on is a late Bronze Age/early Iron Age midden site which elsewhere (Whitchurch, Warwickshire) has produced evidence for metal working (Parkhouse pers comm.).","fourFigureLat":"52.066511","fourFigureLon":"-1.549192","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"June 28, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-5FD941.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"59.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
