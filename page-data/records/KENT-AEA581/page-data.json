The dagger has a lozenge-shaped cross section and the break is ragged and appears to have happened in antiquity. Despite the break the blade is in relatively good condition save for a number of nicks along its edge. The blade is a dark brown and orange colour and is not showing particularly obvious signs of copper corrosion.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 78.62mm long, 22.49mm wide, 3.25mm thick and 16.6g in weight\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This fragment likely relates to a dagger of early Bronze Age, specifically of Camerton-Snowshill type or a derivative thereof, these daggers relate to the end of the early Bronze Age (Period 4)  c.1750-1550 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.24360274","fourFigureLon":"0.34820876","fromdate":"-1750","todate":"-1550","notes":"\nWe are grateful to Peter Reevil and Stuart Needham for further information on this object.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Peckham","county":"Kent","district":"Tonbridge and Malling","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTAEA581.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"78.62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
