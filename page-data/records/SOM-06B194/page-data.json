The septum is gradually thickens from 3.0 mm at the butt to 7.4 mm before the stop. The septum is 54.2 mm in length and 24.4 mm in width. The flanges gradually widen from the butt to the stop to a maximum of 31.4 mm on one side and 29.6 mm on the other side, creating a triangular shape in profile. The stop is angled forwards slightly at its centre and is thicker than the flanges at the centre at 31.3 mm. An integral loop survives on one side and measure 21.9 mm in length. The loop starts before the widest part of the flange and continues towards the blade side. On the other side, diametrically opposite to the loop and near to the flange top, is a shallow hole. The hole measure 4.7 mm in the inner diameter.\n\n\n\nThe elongated, narrow blade is sub-rectangular in section with curved sides that widen gradually towards the blade, before curving out at the blade tips to meet the convex curve of the blade edge. The blade thins from the stop to the edge. The broad faces of the blade are noticeable convex with a central ridge projecting down the blade from the stop. The blade is 62.0 mm in length from the stop ridge to the cutting edge and 21.7 mm in width across the stop ridge. The cutting edge is 35.9 mm in width and 2.8 mm in thickness, it is chipped and any edge bevel is now unclear.\n\n\n\nThe palstave appears plain and with a green-brown patina all around. Traces of the original surface remains on the loop, on the stop ridge and on one side of the blade.\n\n\n\nThe palstave measures 123.8 mm in length and weights 245.9 g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave dates in general to the Middle Bronze Age. The side loop and a much narrower blade tending towards oval in cross section suggest a late dating, from BC 1300 to 1150. A similar example from Salcombe, Devon (Knight, Ormod, Pearce 2015, no. 163b) is dated along with other materials from AC 1300 to 1150. Another example is from Maentwrog, Gwynedd (Savory 1980, no.178).","fourFigureLat":"51.16781579","fourFigureLon":"-2.31603378","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sabrina Ruffino","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sabrina Ruffino","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Selwood","county":"Somerset","district":"Mendip","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sab91/SOM06B194_.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"123.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
