Found in an area with Bronze Age and Roman artefacts. The surface is characterised by lumps and hollows and has a tin element is indicated relating to bronze working. The slag has a good deep green patina, similar to that seen on some local Bronze Age metalwork, so it may date from this period. If this lump of slag is indeed Bronze Age, it is interesting that it has survived and was not re-melted. Fragments of casting waste like this one are hard to date. Scientific analysis of the elemental composition of the copper alloy would allow a more accurate date to be suggested.\n\n\n\nFragment 1. The length is 45mm, the width is 22mm.\n\n\n\nFragment 2.
