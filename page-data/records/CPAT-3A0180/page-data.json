It has 3 parallel ribs running along either side of the blade, a double moulding around the mouth and a distinctive lump between the loop and the blade. A very similar example was excavated from the Breiddin Hillfort (about 10km away) and this form is a common type in north and east Wales and the Marches (Musson, C R et al 1991, pp133 & 136).\n\nThree axeheads were found at Cherrytree Bank, Welshpool in 1977 (CPAT PRN2192). Two were donated to Powysland Museum, the third was retained by the finder (or a member of his family) and subsequently lost. This was found in a house in Llanymynech and appears (from records made in 1977) to be the missing axehead. Re-reported in July 2005.","fourFigureLat":"52.664082","fourFigureLon":"-3.154755","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Donated to Powysland Museum, Welshpool in 2008 to be reunited with the other 2 axeheads.
