The axe appears to have had a long and interesting life and has been used despite a small casting flaw in the form of a hole below the loop. The two parts of the mould were not aligned properly; the casting seams have been smoothed and the axe shows signs of use. There are striations on the blade; the blade has been shaped and formed and has been used and resharpened. The blade is now blunt and this may have been deliberate.\n\n\n\nThe axe shows clear signs of initial work to break it up for recycling. The socket is distorted and torn. The breaks appear fairly fresh and apart from the contemporary damage the axe is otherwise well preserved with a dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.91767139","fourFigureLon":"0.3686823","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lindsell","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/151550.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"80.05"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
