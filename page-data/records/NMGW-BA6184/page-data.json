Plain socketed axe of Type Portree - near complete. \n\n\n\nLength 100.5mm; surviving blade width 58.1mm; external mouth dimensions 47.2mm by 38.2mm; weight 276.3g. \n\n\n\nNear complete bronze socketed axe with angular face edges and sub-rectangular cross-section. The loop is missing and there is some peripheral damage to the out-turned blade edge. The axe has an onset collar below the mouth and the axe was cast with mismatching mould halves, the collar on one side being markedly deeper than on the other. The surface has a dark grey-green and black patina, with small patches of light green corrosion around the mouth and along the blade edge.\n\n\n\n2. Ribbed socketed axe fragment \n\n\n\nSurviving length 42.8mm; surviving width 23.5mm; weight 27.4g. \n\n\n\nSmall mouth and partial face fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset collar. Two narrow raised ribs are visible, descending from the underside of the collar down the long axis of the surviving upper face. The fragment is markedly bent near the lower face break, suggesting deliberate force in breakage during antiquity. The surface displays a dark grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n3. Ribbed socketed axe fragment \n\n\n\nSurviving Length 60.6mm; surviving width 23.1mm; weight 55.1g. \n\n\n\nSmall mouth and upper body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth moulding is out-turned but poorly defined, the mouth top uneven and imperfectly cast. Two raised narrow ribs extend down one upper face, while a single rib survives on the reverse axe face. The other rib is represented only partially by a short narrow rib on the edge of the break. This fragment has been bent in antiquity, one surviving face section being pressed together against the other, while the lower face break is also distorted inwards. The surface has a grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n4. Plain or faceted socketed axe fragment \n\n\n\nSurviving length 37.4mm; surviving width 40.4mm; weight 27.2g. \n\n\n\nSmall upper face and side fragment of a plain or faceted socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset and well-defined collar. The original outer face has been deliberately bent inside out, making the original inner socket face convex and appear to be the outer surface, on first view. The surface a dark grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n5. Socketed axe fragment \n\n\n\nSurviving length 35.5mm; surviving width 22.7mm; weight 33.3g. \n\n\n\nSmall middle face and side fragment of a socketed axe of bronze, with a prominent casting seam. No ribs are visible on the surviving face. The fragment has been forcibly distorted and broken in antiquity and there is twisting and inner face cracking evident. The surface has a dark grey-green patina. 6.-8. Three fragments of a single and incomplete Plain Pegged Spearhead Estimated original length of complete spearhead 270-300mm Combined surviving weight 134.7g. This was originally a large spearhead of Plain Pegged type, with a lanceolate or flame-shaped blade.\n\n\n\n6. Spearhead socket and lower blade fragment \n\n\n\nLength 96.4mm; external diameter of socket 25.8-26.1mm; maximum width 32.0mm; weight 67.3g. \n\n\n\nSocket and lower blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze. The circular socket has slightly convex sides, giving it an external barrel-shaped profile. Two circular peg holes (each 5.5-6.5mm in diameter) are located 34.5-34.7mm from the mouth end of the socket. The spear blade has a pronounced and stepped blade bevel, the blade edge merging with the socket at a shallow and even angle. The lower blade wall thickness varies markedly on each face, suggesting casting imperfections. The break is uneven and occurred in antiquity, creating a small tear on one lower blade face. Areas of bronze metal are evident, with patches of dark grey and dark green patination also present.\n\n\n\n7. Spearhead blade fragment \n\n\n\nSurviving length 65.4mm; surviving width 39.9mm; maximum thickness 12.1mm; weight 46.6g. \n\n\n\nMiddle blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead tip fragment 8 (below). The spearhead has a prominent mid-ridge, which is lozenge shaped in cross-section, and a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. The fragment is bent at both ends, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. Impact scars on one lower face suggests that the spearhead was bent and broken by being struck with a blunt bladed implement. The blade edges are badly corroded and damaged with pale green corrosion surfaces. The faces have a grey-green patination, one face being well preserved with crisp definition and lustre and the other being markedly rough, with a dull corrosion surface.\n\n\n\n8. Spearhead blade tip fragment \n\n\n\nSurviving length 54.2mm; surviving width 23.5mm; maximum thickness 9.7mm; weight 20.6g. \n\n\n\nThis is a tip fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead middle blade fragment 7 (above). The tip fragment has a prominent mid-ridge, tapering at the end to form a solid tip, also with a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. Bending is evident near the break, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. One blade edge and side is badly damaged and corroded with pale green and unstable corrosion surfaces, which also extends across one side of the break point. The surface has a grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n9. Penannular bracelet - fragment with terminal \n\n\n\nSurviving length 68.6mm; diameter of terminal 16.7 by 14.5mm; hoop diameter 5.4mm by 5.1mm; weight 22.9g. \n\n\n\nA fragment of a bronze penannular bracelet with an expanded oval-shaped terminal, representing between one third and one half of the original bracelet. The hoop has a near circular cross-section, though with slight flattening along the inner circumference, and was broken in antiquity. The bracelet had an internal front to back diameter of approximately 50mm and it is estimated that it once had an internal side to side diameter of 71-76mm. The bracelet surfaces have a green patina.\n\n\n\n10. Ingot or recycled bronze fragment-- near complete \n\n\n\nMaximum height 55.5mm; diameter of base 74.0mm; maximum width 77.4mm; weight 670.4g.\n\n\n\nBronze ingot or re-smelted bronze fragment. The molten metal was cooled inside the base of a ceramic vessel, set into the ground surface at an angle, so cooling into one half of the base and up one side of the interior vessel side-surface. The vessel once had an external base diameter of 105-115mm. The upper cooling surface is rough and irregular, while the underside surfaces have surface vesicles, representing air bubbles in the molten metal as it cooled. The base surface is slightly concave, while the side diverges and become wider with a convex profile, taking the contours of the internal vessel surface. A small fragment of the whole piece was removed in antiquity near the top of the body side. The upper cooling surface has a green patina, while the underside has large areas of light green surface corrosion with small areas of dark-green patina surviving.\n\n\n\n11. Plano-convex ingot/cake fragment \n\n\n\nSurviving length 40.7mm; max. surviving width 62.7mm; max. thickness 13.3mm; weight 119.6g. \n\n\n\nPlano-convex ingot/cake fragment of bronze, representing one long-axis end of an irregular oval-shaped cake. The upper cooling surface is irregular and uneven. The lower surface is convex in shape, though uneven with slight flattening near the break, which was made in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.\n\n\n\n12. Single-runner casting-jet - complete \n\n\n\nMaximum height 29.1mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 35.2mm by 27.2mm; length of runner 13.7 mm; max. width of runner 12.5mm; weight 50.6g. \n\n\n\nA complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a near flat upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards steeply with a convex form on one side and a concave form on the other. A single, narrow and prominent runner extends from the central base of the reservoir aligned parallel with the long-axis of the reservoir. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.\n\n\n\n13. Single-runner casting-jet - complete \n\n\n\nMaximum height 31.4mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 30.2mm by 23.3mm; length of runner 6.5mm; width of runner 21.1mm; weight 50.5g. \n\n\n\nA complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough, uneven and concave upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a straight to slightly convex profile. A wide and single runner extends from under the base of the reservoir, being the same width as the base width of the reservoir. The runner has been snapped off just a short distance (6.5mm) from the reservoir base. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.\n\n\n\n14. Small single-runner casting-jet - complete \n\n\n\nMaximum height 16.0mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 23.5mm by 19.2 mm; weight 13.9g. \n\n\n\nA small single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan, with a rough, uneven upper surface, with a significant hollowing at its centre. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a slightly convex profile. Prominent but thin seams of metal have extruded between joins in the upper mould and parallel with the long axis of the jet. The reservoir has been snapped off near its base, with no clear runner stub evident. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.\n\n\n\n15. Four-runner casting-jet - half fragment \n\n\n\nMaximum height 27.1mm; top surface length 52.2mm; maximum surviving width 24.8mm; length of runners 19.1mm & 13.8mm; maximum width of runners at base 13.2 & 13.4mm; weight 47.2g. \n\n\n\nHalf fragment of a large four-runner casting jet of bronze, created during the casting of a South Wales type socketed axe. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough and uneven upper surface. The reservoir tapers and is shallow with a central perforation and uneven depth, deepest in proximity to the two surviving runner stubs. The runners are wide and prominent. Both runners are broken below the base of the reservoir. The break lines have even corrosion suggesting they occurred in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.\n\n\n\n16. Dried out wood fragments (3) \n\n\n\nSurviving lengths: 56.3mm, 44.9mm & 32.7mm; maximum surviving widths 11.0mm, 11.8mm & 14.7mm; weights 1.1g, 0.6g & 0.4g (combined 2.1g). \n\n\n\nThree small and elongate wood fragments, showing severe shrinking, cracking and warping, due to the drying out process inevitably speeded up by the removal of the wood from its burial context. Careful inspection under the microscope reveals no visible evidence of working and shaping of the wood, however the drying out and shrinking process hinders the identification of possible shape, form and working evidence. The wood fragments merit retaining and safe care as material for possible future radiocarbon dating samples and the potential for independent absolute dating of the burial of the hoard.\n\n\n\nMetallurgical analysis (Mary Davis) \n\n\n\nQualitative and non-destructive surface analysis was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken with 40 kV and 3A for 100 live seconds. There was no surface preparation of the artefacts; the relatively high kV setting would have allowed penetration of the X-rays through corrosion layers, and resulting spectra could be compared with those from similar artefacts, but would not allow for the production of quantitative data.\n\n\n\nResults: The ingot or recycled bronze fragment (No. 10) and plano-convex ingot or cake fragment (No. 11) were both found to be of leaded bronze in composition.","fourFigureLat":"51.74662995","fourFigureLon":"-4.3770124","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Discussion (Adam Gwilt & Simone L Johnson)\n\n\n\nThe fifteen metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).\n\n\n\nThe near complete socketed axe (No. 1) most resembles a plain form known as Type Portree, which has a flaring onset collar, with a sub-rectangular body section, with concave sides and an expanded cutting edge (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 184). Parallel examples have been found within secure Ewart Park hoards from Pendoylan, Vale of Glamorgan and Llanddewi Rhydderch, Monmouthshire (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 276 & Fig. 41; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 187; Green 1985, 276-80, Fig. 5 & Pl. 5; Northover unpublished, H.79 & H.119). Plain socketed axes of slightly different forms have also been found within a further eleven hoards from Wales with secure Ewart Park associations, including the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire, Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire hoards (Briggs & Williams 1995, 46 & Fig. 4.1; Northover unpublished H. 38, 76 & 140; Wear unpublished). It is possible that the plain or faceted socketed axe fragment (No. 4) could be another example of Type Portree, however it is not entirely diagnostic and could equally have once belonged to a faceted axe of Type Gillespie (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 191).\n\n\n\nTwo socketed axe fragments belonged to ribbed socketed axes (Nos. 2 & 3), however insufficient survives to identify them with certainty to type. However, the narrow but pronounced collars, without upper or lower mouldings and parallel ribs, suggest that these fragments once probably belonged to South Wales Type or South Wales Variant socketed axes (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2; Needham 1981; 1990, 38-41; Northover unpublished, 259). This probable attribution is further strengthened by the four-runner casting jet (No. 15) which was definitely created during the casting of a South Wales Type socketed axe, a four-runner casting technology being a distinctive and diagnostic technology for this particular socketed axe form (Needham 1981, 27; Northover unpublished, 259). South Wales type socketed axes are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), though they are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and southern England (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66). Six examples have been found in the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire hoard (Briggs & Williams 1995), with further single examples in the Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoards (Northover unpublished H. 76; Wear unpublished; Gwilt et al unpublished). Four-runner casting jets have been discovered within a number of secure Ewart Park hoards from south east Wales: St Mellons (Cardiff), Llangybi (Monmouthshire), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Cowbridge, St Nicholas and Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan) (e.g. Stanton 1984; Gwilt 2004; unpublished; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished).\n\n\n\nThe three spearhead fragments (Nos. 6-8) were once part of a single and large Plain Pegged spearhead approximately 27-30cm long. A similar long-bladed spearhead is known in the St Fagans, Cardiff hoard (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 273 & Fig. 40). The mid-blade and tip fragments (Nos. 7 & 8) are joining fragments, though the mid to lower blade section of this spearhead is missing. Plain Pegged spearheads as an artefact class generally span in date from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of similar Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800BC. In Wales, there are twelve other known hoards of Ewart Park date which include Plain Pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen, Manorbier (both Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (both Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llantarnam (Torfaen), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick unpublished a; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished). The barrel-shaped profile of the socket of the St Ishmael spearhead is a late feature, generally observed amongst spearheads in Ewart Park hoards (Richard Davis pers comm), for example in the Wick Park (Somerset), Heathery Burn Cave (Durham), St Fagans (Cardiff), St Nicholas Llantwit Major and Cowbridge (all Vale of Glamorgan) hoards (Britton 1968; McNeil 1973, 48-9 & Figs. 6-7; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats 273 & 281, Figs 40 & 42) . The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, this spearhead is thought on stylistic grounds to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).\n\n\n\nThe penannular bracelet or armlet fragment (No. 9) may be identified as of British, rather than Irish form, by comparison with other gold and bronze bracelet types (Eogan 1994, 85-88). Its precise characteristics include a near round-sectioned hoop but with a slight flattening of the inner circumference, an expanding terminal with slight inward expansion but more pronounced outward expansion and with a solid, flat ended but oval shaped terminal. This would seem to share characteristics with Covesea type / British Variety 7 and British Variety 9 bracelets (Coles 1959-60; Eogan 1994, 85). In Wales, the two closest parallels are a bronze example from The Breiddin hillfort, Powys and a bronze bracelet in the St Nicholas hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Coombs 1991, 136-8, Cat. 159, Fig. 56; Gwilt et al 2005, 55, Appendix 3, 13 & 15; Gwilt unpublished). The former has a thicker hoop, but shares a slight internal expansion of the terminal but with a more pronounced external expansion, while the latter has an oval-sectioned hoop and an oval shaped terminal, but expanding equally both internally and externally. The bracelet from The Breiddin was associated with a Late Bronze Age hillfort occupation phase (Musson 1991, 177-8) and was generally associated with metalwork of Ewart Park date (Coombs 1991, 132-41), while the St Nicholas hoard also has secure Ewart Park associations.\n\n\n\nCasting jets (Nos. 12-15) only become common discoveries within hoard associations during the Late Bronze Age. These are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, with thirteen other hoards of secure Ewart Park date from Wales now known to include them: the Penwyllt (Powys), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Penarth, Cowbridge, St Nicholas, Llancarfan, Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Llantarnam (Torfaen), St Mellons (Cardiff), Glascoed and Llangybi (both Monmouthshire) hoards (Savory 1980, 120-22, Cats. 274, 281 284; Stanton 1984; Gwilt, 2004, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 & 4; 2008; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished).\n\n\n\nPlano-convex ingots (No. 11) of copper and bronze are common components of Ewart Park hoards. Over 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan 1 and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex bronze ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). The Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoard contained eight copper ingot fragments as a major component of the hoard (Gwilt et al unpublished), while the Freshwater Bay, Pembrokeshire hoard included twenty three fragments of plano-convex ingot fragments of copper (Murphy unpublished; Northover unpublished). The ingot or recycled bronze fragment cooled in a ceramic vessel (No. 10) has been shown to be of leaded bronze composition, a typical Late Bronze Age signature and consistent with the other artefacts and the plano-convex ingot fragment. Inclusion of such material is consistent with the frequent inclusion of casting bi-products and ingot material in hoards of Ewart Park date (1000-800BC).\n\n\n\nThe small dried out wood fragments (No. 16 above) were directly associated with the hoard, having been found next to the near complete socketed axe (No. 1). Although it now proves difficult to detect clear evidence for the deliberate working of these fragments, in part dues to the drying out process, nevertheless it may be possible to identify the species of the wood through micro-sampling and microscopy work. In addition, this organic material could provide valuable radiocarbon dating samples, in order to gain independent dating evidence for the burial of the hoard.\n\n\n\nThe archaeological findspot investigation, undertaken with the assistance of the finder, enabled the details of the reported depths and an account of the relative positioning of artefacts to be clarified. Hand excavation of a test pit over the location of the rediscovered findspot indicated that the metal detector pit, created when the artefacts were retrieved from the ground, had removed all evidence of the original burial context. No further artefacts were discovered during the archaeological investigation. However, the base of a small pit feature was discovered adjacent to the location of the hoard. This contained an undisturbed fill incorporating occasional flecks of charcoal - suggesting human activity rather than being naturally derived. The evidence suggests that the hoard was originally buried as a single closed deposit of directly associated artefacts in a single small pit, one of a pair of isolated pits, seemingly located remote from any known Late Bronze Age settlements. A search of the Heritage Environment Record for the locality indicated the existence of possible Bronze Age standing stones a few hundred metres to the north east of the findspot, although their prehistoric date remains questionable (Marion Page pers comm). However, it seemed probable that the siting of the hoard was, in part, selected for its landscape location, with its dramatic coastal views.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBarnwell, E.L.
