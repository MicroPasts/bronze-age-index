A short fragment from a leaf-shaped sword blade of lentoid section with faint grooves on either side running parallel to the two cutting edges. The edges converge, suggesting this fragment to come from near the mid-part of the blade. The development of swords designed for a slashing action is attributed to the later Bronze Age. The broken edge at one end of the fragment is worn [bottom], but the opposite edge [top] is rough and may suggest a larger sword fragment has been further fragmented in recent times. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC.\n\n\n\nLength: 26.1mm, Width: 38.1mm, Thickness: 5.9mm, Weight: 28.65gms","fourFigureLat":"53.62381127","fourFigureLon":"-0.64070829","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Martin Foreman","datefound1":"April 08, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Martin Foreman","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Roxby cum Risby","county":"North Lincolnshire","district":"North Lincolnshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mforeman/NLM35844.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"North Lincolnshire Museum","length":"26.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
