Placed at the centre of the object on each side mirroring each other are two circular concave depressions measuring 8.2mm in diameter that are each approximately 1.5mm deep. However, the object is 4.8mm thick such that these depressions do not pierce through from one side to the other.\n\n\n\nThe artefact has a terminal knop projecting 6.2mm from the wider side of this item. This knop is pierced by a hole c.4mm in diameter. In cross section the knop is rectangular, however, the majority of the object, barring the concave depressions, is a pointed oval in cross section.\n\n\n\nThe object appears to be solid and has a light green patina and shows a little abrasion.\n\n\n\nFrom the knop to its far end the artefact measure 26.8mm long, it is 4.8mm thick and it weighs10.28g.\n\n\n\nIf the concave depressions were pierced through the the object would be very similar in form to items found from a hoard at Parc-Y-Meirch, known as the Dinorben hoard (Savory 1980, 187). These are seen as the inner pieces of composite strap fittings. The Dinorben hoard is dated to c.9th century BC (ibid, 59) a time within the Late Bronze Age (c. 1150 - 800 cal BC). Similar items on the database such as LIN-34D2A3, NMGW-A0EC15 have also been dated to this period although there are now suggestions that these should be placed in the Iron Age (see CAM-6A8D1B, WAW-03C3E2)","fourFigureLat":"51.19517776","fourFigureLon":"-1.90120483","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"October 01, 2018","datefound2":"January 02, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"8.2","edge":null,"thickness":"4.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shrewton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM797D49.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
