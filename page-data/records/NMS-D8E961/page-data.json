The blade is leaf-shaped with a lozengiform sectioned midrib. It exhibits a hollow socket and cast side loops. The spearhead measures 126mm total length, 20.8mm maximum width, 1.6mm minimum width. The mouth has a diameter of 17.1mm. It weighs 42.3g.\n\n\n\nThe tip of the blade exhibits some chipping and the edges of the blade are incomplete due to old breakages. The blade measures 73.8mm in length. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering lozenge shaped midrib which expands into the socket of the spear. The socket mouth is circular in shape and exhibits old breakages around the circumference. The socket is filled with soil. Just below the bottom of the blade, the spear has suffered a recent break across the socket, probably as a result of agricultural activity. The mouth of the socket is filled with soil. At the break point there are traces of wood visible.\n\n\n\nThe loops are positioned on either side of the socket, just below the break, approximately opposite one another. The loops measure c.16.5mm in length, 6.1mm in width and project 2.5mm from the socket. Casting ribs are visible running along both sides of the body from the mouth to the point at which the blade commences and appear to have been filed.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a mottled dark brown patina with patches of green.\n\n\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).\n\n\n\nCf.
