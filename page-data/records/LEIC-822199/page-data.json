The spearhead is broadly triangular in shape with both long edges and the tip well preserved. A strong narrow mid-rib is present terminating near the tip. The mid-rib does not divide the fragment evenly suggesting that the blades had been sharpened on a regular basis with one edge being worn away more than the other. Blade bevels on both long edges are present. The break is patinated suggesting that it is due to old damage rather than something more recent in the burial environment. It is possible that the break was a deliberate one prior to deposition when the weapon was ‘decommissioned’. This is more likely as the depositional landscape is dominated with streams and drained / improved wetland fields with poor drainage (further indicated by the iron staining from soil mineralisation / panning present on the lower blade). The blade is a mid-green colour with a well formed surface patina. A direct parallel and date cannot be attributed due to the undiagnostic nature of the fragment. It is most likely to be later Middle Bronze Age (1400-1150 BC) in form due to its strong lozenge sectioned.\n\nLength: 65 mm\n\nWidth: 25 mm\n\nWeight: 13.69 g","fourFigureLat":"52.57770464","fourFigureLon":"-1.29310086","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Megan Gard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Megan Gard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thurlaston","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Blaby","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/822199.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
