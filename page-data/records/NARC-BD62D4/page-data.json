The object is a waste fragment from the top of the mould, where the alloy was poured into the mould. It is oval in shape, with two projecting lugs, where the molten metal ran down into the rest of the mould. It measures 33.58 mm long, 24.75 mm wide and is 28.87 mm long. It weighs 51.1 grams. As such casting jets are associated with the manufacture of many cast objects over a very long period of time they can be difficult to date, but given the shape and patina this example has been given a probable Bronze Age date (2150 - 800 BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.299816","fourFigureLon":"-1.444177","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"December 16, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hunningham","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Warwick","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/sprue.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"33.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
