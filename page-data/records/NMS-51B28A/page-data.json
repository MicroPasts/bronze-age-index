The cutting edge is convex and complete, apart from a small fragment missing from a non-recent break. At the other end the object terminates in a non-recent transverse break. The side edges are transversally convex and longitudinally concave as they flare out to meet the tips of the cutting edge. The axehead is necessarily thicker at the break than at the blade. Viewed side-on, the edges taper convexly to meet at a point at the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the metal is patinated dark and mid-green, and is also notably crazed (covered with a network of fine cracks) on both faces and side edges, probably as a result of burning. The cracks on one face are patinated bright green. On the face of the transverse break there are traces of red-brown patination. c. 2350-1500 BC\n\n\n\nLength (cutting edge to transverse break): 43.9mm. Width (span of cutting edge): 51.0mm.
