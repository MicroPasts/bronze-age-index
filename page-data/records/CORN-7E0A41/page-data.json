This end, opposite the blade end, would have been hafted to a wooden handle. The fragment tapers slightly towards the butt end which is rounded off and widens towards the broken edge which has been partly chiselled off, but has since softened through corrosion and wear. The axehead would have continued to expand into a triangular flat blade which is now missing. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now very pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe length is 50 mm, the width of broken edge is 32 mm and the width of the butt end is 26.5 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 8 mm and the thickness of the butt end is 5 mm.\n\n\n\nSimilar slender flat axes with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.\n\n\n\nEven though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of slender Migdale type flat axes from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall and Salcombe in Devon, on pages 400 & 453, plates 1 & 38, nos.6 & 289, and a similar fragment of a flat axe that has been chiselled at one end from Penzance, Cornwall on page 423, pl. 15, no.123, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Braddock Downs in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.36, 111 & 213.\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
