The object is in fair condition with a brown patina and weighs 28.41 grams. The object is circular at one end and for three quarters of its length it tapers gradually, becoming crescentic in section with a curved edge. The section is formed of two distinct ridges which run along its length before converging and disappearing into the now circular body. The circular end of the object is hollow, forming a socket with a wall 5mm thick, whilst the rest is solid. There is a deep crescent shaped area missing from the socket, which appears to have rendered it useless.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"June 21, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"14","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"King's Norton","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Harborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/4AC3D3.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"66.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
