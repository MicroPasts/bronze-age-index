The broken section has eroded, making it difficult to determine if the axe has fractured at the bottom of the socket of a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age type, or through a solid palstave of the Middle to Late Bronze age. The axe fragment has the remnants of a single rib running down one of the faces. The other face is irregular with large pitting, which may have been a feature of the axe, rather than a corrosion effect. The blade edge has been lost through corrosion but was originally expanded. The axe would have been of slender form, perhaps suggesting a ribbed palstave rather than a socketed axe.\n  The original surface of the axe has a light to mid brown patina, but has areas of active green corrosion through the surface.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rudbaxton","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0119.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
