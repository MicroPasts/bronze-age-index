The fragment is a side portion of the socket mouth. The rim of the mouth has a slightly bulbous ‘n’ shaped profile, particularly on the exterior face. The mouth is then moulded with a wide horizontal high relief band before the body of the axe continues. Only a fragment of the axe body remains before it is broken. This edge is not a recent break, as the patina continues over the broken edge. On the exterior a vertical casting seam bisects the fragment. The interior surface is undecorated and is slightly undulating. The fragment has a well developed heavy dark brown patina. There is some corrosion along the broken edge. It measures 22.83mm long from the rim to the broken edge and 27.38mm wide. It weighs 9.5g.\n\nThe fragment dates to the late Bronze Age (-1150 to -800).","fourFigureLat":"52.066618","fourFigureLon":"-1.578367","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"April 15, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-5FE071.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"22.83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
