It is extensively worn. The tip is missing.\n\nIn section the spearhead has a circular shaft (6.6mm diameter), apparantly with a clay fill, if so presumably left over from the casting process and creating a weak point for the spear to snap at.\n\nThe spearhead has a prominent mid-rib. From its current outline (although heavily worn and damaged) it is probably Greenwell and Brewis Type Va, and would have had peg-holes for attachment instead of loops. This would give a Late Bronze Age date, c.10th-11th century BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.330094","fourFigureLon":"-1.97268","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"July 31, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stert","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/DC0806spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"49.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
