The butt fragment is likely to be from a developed flat axe or flanged axe of later Early Bronze Age date, metalworking stage IV, corresponding to Needham's 1996 Period 3, c. 2100 - 1700 BC. It is possible however, that the fragment may be from a small palstave of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1500 - 1150BC. The fragment has a surviving length of 27.1mm and a maximum surviving width at the break of 15.9mm. The butt is neatly rounded and has a thickness of 1.3mm. The sides are straight and diverge gently before the break. The sides are rounded and the flanges are marked by facets. The faces are flat except for the low flanges, which have a maximum surviving height of 0.5mm. At the break the fragment has a thickness of 8.2mm across the flanges and 7.3mm across the septum. The fragment weighs 15.8g. The fragment appears to have come from a well cast axe and has been neatly finished. One face has a silvery appearance, possibly because of surface enrichment of tin. The surface is in good condition with dark green to brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-1500","notes":"This fragment probably once belonged to a Class 4 or Class 5 axe (following Needham 1983), and dated to the MA V Willerby to MA VI Arreton phases of the Early Bronze Age (c.1750-1500 BC) (Needham et al. 1997). Similar flanged axes from which this piece may have originated can be seen in Savory (1980, Fig.18, Nos. 121, 259), though no further classification can be achieved from this fragment.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Malmesbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.25.1b.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"27.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
