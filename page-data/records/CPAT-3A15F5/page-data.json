The edges are bevelled (bevels up to 4mm in width) and some of the surface scratches may be evidence of sharpening, only parts of the blade-edge survive. Two incomplete rivet holes can be discerned at the damaged butt, but insufficient of either survive to allow the diameters to be established. The thickness ranges from 4mm towards the tip to 2mm at the base. There is much pitting and other areas of corrosion on the surface.
