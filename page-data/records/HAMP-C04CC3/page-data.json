These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead 1998; ref. 117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material. An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Robin Iles pers. comm. 9th July 2012; Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35).\n\n\nThe object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper part. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the lower surface, which come to a halt about halfway along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminal plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end. Other hollow examples recorded on this database include: SUSS-3AEC48, WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. The opening is a maximum of 7.9mm long.\n\n\nDue to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete. Based on other known examples (e.g. SF-520513) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original. The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle, with a hole through the centre of this bridge. This form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings. The purpose of these items is unknown but a scabbard chape is the usual suggestion.","fourFigureLat":"50.95881","fourFigureLon":"-1.218269","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"July 01, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"30","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Bishops Waltham","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-C04CC3unidentifiedobject.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"19.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
