The axe is comparatively long and slender in form. The mouth is somewhat circular, but the socket profile is sub-square and the axe has a sub-rectangular body section. The collar is simple and flared with no mouldings. The mouth-edge surface no longer survives, but the axe was likely to have been cast using a two-runner casting technique. The loop (now broken) is slight and of oval-section, springing from the underside of the collar, and gently arcs back to the side. The sides are straight or slightly concave before they recurve to the blade end. The casting seams are clear on both sides and have been neatly finished, probably by abrasion. The blade end has been damaged, but would have been expanded and curved. Both faces have clear hammered-marks on the lower third of the axe. Sharpening striations running along the blade edge are visible on both faces. One face has many striations running along the length of the axe, but it is unclear if these are deliberate or from antiquity. The axe is in comparatively good condition with a dark green patina, but with areas of damage at the mouth and blade. The top of the axe has a patchy black coating or deposit, possibly tenorite.","fourFigureLat":"51.696683","fourFigureLon":"-2.695892","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-950","notes":"The axe is likely to be an early socketed axe, probably of Wilburton type and metalworking tradition, and dating to c. 1100 - 950BC.
