The dagger is leaf shaped, slender and roughly a pointed oval in cross-section. Either side of the blade there are developed bevels; two either side of the main ridge angling down towards the blade edge. The blade tapers towards the tip, which is now flat through wear rather than being pointed. The flat tip is well patinated, having the same patination as the blade body. The edges of the blade are damaged in places with small concave 'nicks', and are again covered with the same patination as the blade tip and body. The tang is roughly rectangular and flares slightly towards the gently curved and worn shoulders. There is a single rivet hole in the centre of the tang to attach it to the handle. The rivet hole is circa 4mm in diameter. The surface condition is very poor with extensive loss due to corrosion. Limited areas of original surface, patinated dark brown remain mainly on the tang and the tip-end of the blade. Elsewhere the surface is smooth and medium brown in colour. \n\n\nDating is slightly problematic. In form the knife is similar to some small rivetted knife/daggers of the Camerton-Showshill phase of the late Early Bronze Age to early Middle Bronze Age, though they usually have a flat blade in cross-section. The blade section and rivet notches suggest a Middle Bronze Age date to be most likely, there are similar examples from Beck Row, Mildenhall (Pendleton 1999, Fig 51-206).\n\n\nLocally, the blade is comparable to one from Bourne, Lincolnshire (Davey, 1973, fig. 19 no. 193, although classified as a dirk), another from Caenby, Lincolnshire (ibid, p90, fig 23, no. 220).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis object was found in association with other Bronze Age, Iron Age and early Roman material, including fIVE terret rings, as listed below. The terret rings were recorded under the Treasure Act (2006 T187) but were declared 'not treasure' due to a lack of evidence to relate them together. The assemblage as a whole however indicates that the site is significant, perhaps as a religious or cult centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlain/simple terret: LIN-676E77\n\n    \nMini terret: LIN-6799A3\n\n    \nFlat-ringed terret: LIN-670AF0\n\n    \nCopper alloy bar: LIN-DDA7C2\n\n    \nSkirted terret: LIN-F0BD14\n\n    \nKnobbed terret: LIN-F0FAB4\n\n    \nBronze Age terminal/pommel: LIN-34D2A3\n\n    \nHorse harness fitting or belt loop:\n\n    \nLangton Down brooch: LIN-03A0A3\n\n    \nBronze Age axe: LIN-14A4E7","fourFigureLat":"53.270604","fourFigureLon":"-0.427002","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"GPS (From FLO)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sudbrooke","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN3164B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"111"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
