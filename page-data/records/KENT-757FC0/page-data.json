Socketed axe\n\n\n\nComplete socketed axe; South-Eastern class B. Double mouth moulding with five ribs on each face. Broad loop. Prominent casting flashes and traces of three low casting jet stumps. Many fine transverse striations on the blade edge. The blade is expanded and the tips are hollowed. The blade edge is intact at the tips, but otherwise is expanded and distorted. There is a crack extending from the mouth to just below the second moulding.\n\n\n\nL: 102.1 Blade W: 54.5 Mouth W: 42.5 Mouth B: 42.5 B loop: 10-11.5\n\n\n\n11. Socketed axe\n\n\n\nComplete, socketed axe; South-Eastern type. Double mouth moulding. Faintly defined hour-glass moulding with circular pellet close to the lower mouth moulding, on both faces. There is not a transverse moulding along the bottom of the hour-glass moulding, but there are shallow mouldings extending from the lower terminals and across the sides to join the moulding on the other face. The casting flashes have been removed from the lower blade, but are visible elsewhere. The casting flashes on the mouth moulding have been unevenly removed and there is a casting jet stump. Multiple transverse striations along the blade edge, which is largely intact.\n\n\n\nL: 122.1 Blade W: 44.6 Mouth W: 38 Mouth B: 42.2\n\n\n\n12.. Socketed axe\n\n\n\nComplete socketed axe; South-Eastern class B. Double mouth moulding. Nine plain ribs extending beyond the mid-way point on one face and seven on the other. The blade tip hollows on both sides. Diffuse bevelling and fine transverse, oblique and longitudinal lines near the blade edge which is well expanded. Much of the blade edge is intact, but very severe blunting, including some burring and some large chips removed from the blade edge. Dense transverse lines on the blade edge on both faces and further oblique, transverse and longitudinal striations on both faces. The casting flashes are worked into neat ridges.\n\n\n\nL: 92.3 Blade W: 51.2 W mouth: 37.3 B mouth: 37 B loop: 5.5-6\n\n\n\n12a. Socketed spearhead fragment\n\n\n\nSocketed spearhead. Leaf-shaped.

Ingots are a well-known feature of this particular period in south-eastern England. The presence of axes, swords and spearheads which may be interpreted as scrap, mixed with ingots of raw material, suggests that this is a founders' hoard.\n\n\n\nAlthough the axes are not fragmented, they do show signs of heavy wear and use and it is likely that they were collected with other surplus bronze to form a metal resource for recycling. A hoard of Bronze Age artefacts of similar types to those represented here was found in close proximity to the findspot of this group of artefacts, by David Button in January 2003 (T200310a). While it is possible that the group of artefacts reported here (T200310b), represents a separate deposit from the earlier discovery in the same field (T200310a), it is also a possibility that the two groups of artefacts originated as part of the same hoard which had been dispersed through the action of the plough.\n\n\n\nAll of these artefacts fall within the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age period and suggest a date of deposition towards the end of the period, around 1000-800 BC. The hoarding of metalwork at this period was not an uncommon phenomenon, particularly in the south-east of Britain.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sally Worrell","datefound1":"February 01, 2003","datefound2":"February 02, 2003","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Karen Dunford","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"20","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector during controlled archaeological investigation","parish":"Hollingbourne","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/karend1/Copy of 2003 T10.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
