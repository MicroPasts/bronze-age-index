The blade is leaf-shaped with a lozengiform sectioned midrib. It exhibits a hollow socket and cast side loops. It is complete apart from a small amount of damage to the base of the socket. The spearhead measures 126.9mm in length, 21.6mm maximum width, 9.3mm minimum thick on the blade, 18.3mm in diameter at the base of the socket and weighs 53.54g.\n\n\n\nThe tip of the blade has a slightly break to one side and the edges of the blade are chipped along their length. The sides widen towards the base but are straight or only very slightly convex. At the base is the widest point then a distinct carination then they angle downwards  into the socket. There seems to be some evidence of a sharpened blade edge but not clear bevel and this is mostly lost to chipping.  The blade measures 62.7mm in length,21.6mm maximum width. The edge of the blade is 0.9mm thick, tapering to a maximum thickness of 2.8mm by the midrib. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering lozenge shaped midrib which expands from a thickness of 2.7mm at the tip to 9.3mm at the base of the head.\n\n\n\nThe socket is oval in cross section at the top wider in line with the midrib, narrower in plane with the blade) 10.9mm by 9.3mm. It becomes circular in shape by the base where it measures 18.7mm in diameter. The mouth of the socket  has an old break to one side. The socket is at least 24.8mm deep but contains dry, copper stained material so was originally deeper. This is dust with no fibrous properties remaining but could be the remains of the wooden haft, or of later mud.\n\n\n\nThe loops are positioned on either side of the socket, about half way down, approximately opposite one another. The loops are curved, more elongated than a semi-circle and have slightly widened outer edges into slight loop plates . The loops measure 11mm in length, 3.5-4mm in width at the base, 4-4.5, at the centre and project 4.5-4.7mmmm from the outside of the socket. The holes are now filled with corrosion. Casting ribs are visible running along both sides of the body from the mouth to the point at which the blade commences.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a mottled dark green patina and the surface is heavily pitted.\n\n\n\nHESH-CFC925, WAW-DC8222, HESH-CE6980 and SWYOR-BF67A6 are similar examples on the database. The record for the former states that: similar side looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).","fourFigureLat":"50.85958744","fourFigureLon":"-2.82543492","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Somerset","district":"South Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elburnett/SOM4FBE8D.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"126.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
