The surviving fragment comprises a sub-triangular, curving section of the blade, tapering into an abraded point at the tip. Both edges are similarly abraded. The blade is lenticular in cross section, with a central ridge on both faces, tapering into the edges. The blade is truncated by an old break.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 49.7mm; width 19.2mm; thickness 3.5mm; weight 8.00g.\n\n\n\ncf. a similar, but more complete sickle found at Edington Burtle (Pearce 1983: 512-513, no. 648). The fragment is too incomplete to be further classified.","fourFigureLat":"51.33005218","fourFigureLon":"-2.10185579","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alyson Tanner","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Alyson Tanner","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Seend","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridge/WILT870D02.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"49.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
