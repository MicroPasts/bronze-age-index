The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade, hollow socket and cast side loops; Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'.The spear head has broken, fairy recently, across the lower part of the blade. The two pieces were found about 6 metres apart. The tip piece is 57.2mm long, 19.9mm wide and 9.6mm thick. The socket piece is 74.2mm long, 23.1mm wide and 17.7mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe blade measures about 75mm in length, 23.1mm in width and the tip of the blade is 2.6mm thick. The overall shape of the blade can be described as being leaf-shaped. It has straight sides at the point end, with a rounded base near the socket. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear.\n\n\n\nThe base of the socket is 17.7mm in diameter. The internal socked measures 63.9mm deep. The two loops are positioned 14.5mm below the base of the blade. The loops measure 14mm in length and are 4.1mm wide. The loops are fairly flat in cross-section.\n\n\n\nThe object has a smooth dark brown to olive green patina which is pitted in places. Some of the blade edge is damaged. The break between the two pieces is less patinated than the rest of the object, but it is not an immediately recent break.\n\n\n\nLVPL-893C73 is a similar example (among others on the PAS database) and the record notes that \"Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, dating from about 1500-1150BC.\" Davis (2017), however, suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly.\n\n\n\nOver all, the spear head is 128.2mm long, 23.1 and 17.7mm thick. 57.6g.","fourFigureLat":"54.02607009","fourFigureLon":"-1.52828268","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"May 29, 2015","datefound2":"May 29, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brearton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2626_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"128.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
