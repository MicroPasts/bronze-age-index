It is ver broad and has a gently curved blade. Due to corrosion, no signs of wear or re-sharpenings can be made out. The butt and sides are very corroded as well, but there are certainly no traces of flanges - thus making it one of the earliest cu-alloy flat axes from the Early Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"54.60108861","fourFigureLon":"-2.51232565","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"January 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dot Boughton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Long Marton","county":"Cumbria","district":"Eden","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dboughton/KMDPABramptonAreaFlatAxe1ab.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"13"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
