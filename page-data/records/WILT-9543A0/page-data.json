A truncated cone shaped body with two curved prongs projecting  from the narrow end. The shape reflects the funnel shaped casting gate  and two projecting feeders into the casting mould. The base of the cone  would have in fact been the upper side into which the metal was poured  and the odd protrusion on one side may reflect the metal cooling as it  was poured into the mould. The metal is dark green with patches of mid  yellow green and pale green corrosion.\n\n\nComparable examples on the PAS database include IOW-CE75F0, SF-9FFB87, WMID-67D243\n\n\nThe casting sprue is 23.8mm in height, 28.55mm wide and weighs 39.99grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.123282","fourFigureLon":"-2.015667","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Richard Henry","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Richard Henry","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"23.8","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stockton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT-9543A0.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
