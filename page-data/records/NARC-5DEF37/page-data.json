The object has a rounded end. Because it is abraded at the attachment end it is hard to discern whether or not the 'body' of the chape would have continued up with straight sides. There are six aligned circular perforations near the point of the old break, three on either side. A couple of these chapes are listed in O'Connor (1980, 190-191; ref. 161). They are associated with the 'carp's tongue complex' of south-east England and date to the Ewart Park metalworking phase.","fourFigureLat":"52.261901","fourFigureLon":"-1.122306","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"September 26, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norton","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/NARC-5DEF37chaperev.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"29.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
