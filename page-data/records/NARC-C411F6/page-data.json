The spear head is a native type, of basal-looped design of the Penard industry. It measures 201 mm in length. The blade is triangular in shape, tapering from 41.6 mm to 11.1 mm at the end of the blade which is missing its tip. The blade emerges from the socket at 81.7 from the base of the socket. At each side of the blade is a loop at the point where blade and socket meet. The beginning of the blade juts out at right angles from these loops.  The socket is 22.5 mm in diameter at its opening and is hollow for 132.5 mm down the shaft, well into the blade of the spearhead. The bulb of the socket continues right down to the tip of the blade, making the blade look like a circle with wings in section. It tapers to 3.7 mm at the broken tip of the blade. On the blade, either side of the socket bulb is a slight depression running to the tip of the blade. This is apparent on both sides of the blade. \n\nThe Penard phase occurred at the very beginning of the Late Bronze Age, owing some of its stylistic features to Middle Bronze Age technologies. This spearhead is likely to date from circa 1200 to 1050 BC. Similar examples are illustrated in Langmaid (1976, 52; 18a/b).    \n\nThis spearhead is in reasonably good condition. It is missing its tip and is a little ragged along the edges of the blade. It also suffers from mild bronze corrosion, but otherwise it has a rich dark green patina. There is an element of scratching on the surface, particularly one side of the socket. As these scratches reveal a different patina to the rest of the artefact it would appear that they are quite recent, and not a result of ancient wear.","fourFigureLat":"52.312227","fourFigureLon":"-0.725248","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 1985","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22.5","discoveryContext":"Gardening","parish":"","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Wellingborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-C411F6BAspearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"201"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
