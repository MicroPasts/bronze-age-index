The remains consist of the blade edge which is worn and a socketed section of the axehead. The fragment is sub rectangular in plan with sides that taper inwards from the blade edge. The axehead has an inverted triangular side profile. There are no casting ridges evident along both sides. The blade edge is rounded and well worn. It is noticeably more worn on one of the outer corners than the other. Some of the original surface has been lost around the blade edge on one face. The axehead has a well worn and abraded green coloured surface patina. There is also a small separate fragment of the object that separated from the main body after it was found. \n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead fragment measures 66.5 mm in length, 48.3 mm wide (at the blade), 38.1 mm wide (at the now damaged and open socket), 26 mm thick (at the open socket), 3.2 mm thick (at the blade edge).
