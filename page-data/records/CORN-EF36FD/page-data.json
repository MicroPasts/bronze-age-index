The blade is narrow with straight sides with no suggestion of flanging and the cutting edge is rounded and blunt, though severely affected by corrosive pitting. The broken end of the blade still has the end of the socket which would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket is 21 mm long, 3 mm wide and 3 mm deep. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has partly corroded away and there are patches of light green bronze disease at the broken end. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, also refered to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but sparse. They date from the end of the Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase, and into Hallstatt C (c.800-700 BC).\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar Amorican socketed axes from Newlyn, Carn Brea and Penquite, in Cornwall, on pages 421 & 424-5, plates 14 & 17, nos.115, 129c & 134.","fourFigureLat":"50.21081767","fourFigureLon":"-5.37916601","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"June 30, 2015","datefound2":"July 26, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gwinear-Gwithian","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Sep15finds049.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
