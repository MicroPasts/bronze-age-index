It has a straight stop-ridge and is characteristic of the products of the north Wales industry. Similar examples have come from Llanbeblig and Great Orme's Head (Caernarfonshire) and Maentwrog (Merionethshire). It is also represented in the Guilsfield Hoard (Savory, H N, 1980). The loop is missing, probably lost in antiquity and it is suffering from bronze disease. It has also been damaged since its discovery.","fourFigureLat":"52.754523","fourFigureLon":"-3.097877","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Blade width 37mm.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jeff Spencer","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jeff Spencer","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Llandysilio","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jspencer/2266-017r.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"147"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
