The chisel has a blade which is square in section and tapers in thickness and slightly in width to a rounded blunt point. This terminal is abraded and probably does not represent the original edge. The blade is slightly bent at the mid point, which is not intentional, but it is not certain when this occurred. At the widest part of the blade there is an integral stop ridge. This ridge is sub-circular in plan and is perpendicular to the blade and tang. The blade protrudes from the centre of one face of the stop ridge, and the tang protrudes from the centre of the other face. The tang is square in section at the junction of the stop ridge, but tapers in thickness, and more slightly in width, similar to the blade, towards a blunt rounded point. There surface is slightly abraded and pitted, but has traces of a heavy green/brown patina. The chisel measures 103.2mm long and the stop ridge is 17.66mm diameter. It weighs 24.1g.\n\nAfter consideration Phil Watson (Principle Curator, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) and Peter Reavill (Herefordshire/Shropshire Finds Liaison Officer) feel the chisel or awl is probably dated to the middle Bronze Age, -1500 to -1150.","fourFigureLat":"52.057628","fourFigureLon":"-1.578452","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Phil Watson","datefound1":"September 16, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17.66","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-EF4C84.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"103.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
