Casting waste is difficult to date, but fragments with this shape are characteristic of the casting of socketed axes of late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC) type.","fourFigureLat":"51.17696891","fourFigureLon":"-0.52790468","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"16.1","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shamley Green and Cranleigh North","county":"Surrey","district":"Waverley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR8C72EE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"30.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
