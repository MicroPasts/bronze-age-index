It is possible that this fragment is a small part of a blade of Bronze Age date (c.2350-801BC). Weight is 14.3g, incomplete length is 29.65mm, width is 25.31mm and thickness is 4.76mm. The cross section was probably originally a flattish oval with the edges tapering out very thin, now mostly missing. The upper and lower surfaces do not seem to have had a higher point/ridged longitudinal centre despite the presence of corrosion product and some patches where the original surface seems to be missing.\n\n\n\nMr Peter Reavill agrees that one section is suggestive of a blade and that a likely date range would be Middle to Late Bronze Age (c.1500-750BC). The blade is likely to be a knife although a fragment of sickle is another consideration, however not enough of the blade survives to be sure. The absence of a prominent mid-rib is not unusual as most slight blades do not have these See PAS record HESH-199F11. Dating Bronze Age knives is difficult and almost impossible with so little surviving as with this example hence the broad date range above. The presence of another Bronze Age artefact fragment (PAS record number ESS-8FB2C3), found by the same finder, within 1km of this artefact's find spot and the context of the find spot helps support the Bronze Age date that has been given to this fragment.","fourFigureLat":"52.56382561","fourFigureLon":"-0.05405059","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Fowler","datefound1":"December 26, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Fowler","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittlesey","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"Fenland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hfowler/CAM-583B44.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Cambridgeshire County Council","length":"29.65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
