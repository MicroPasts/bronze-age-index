In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges, and in section, at the broken butt end, it is rectangular. The blade is flaring to the edge and the blade facet is bevelled from hammering. The long side-edges of the axe are slightly flanged. The broken edge would have continued to taper towards the butt end. The blade edge is uneven with perpendicular nicks across the edge which show that it was used in antiquity. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, and the surface is not very corroded or pitted, with a few marks and strikes such as a linear shallow groove on one side, caused by damage prior to deposition (Laura Ratcliffe pers comm). There is also a circular depression that has been caused by a gas bubble forming when the axe was cast.\n\n\n\nThe length is 64 mm, the width of broken end is 39 mm and the width of the blade is 66 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 9.5 mm and the thickness of the blade edge is 4 mm.\n\n\n\nSimilar flat axes on the database can be seen in DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-3324F7, LANCUM-6507C2 and LVPL-851560.\n\n\n\nEven though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe on page 400, Plate 1, No.6, from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall, and broad Migdale type flat axes from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall and Hemyock and Kentisbeare in Devon, on pages 418, 443 & 446, Plates 12, 31 & 33, Nos.98c, 243 & 259, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
