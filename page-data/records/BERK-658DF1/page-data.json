Casting lines are visible along both edges. The palstave measures 120.85mm long, and has a maximum thickness of 19.88mm. The blade is 33.87mm wide and the object weighs 158.9gms. There is some damage to the butt of the object.\n\n\n\nThis type of palstave, with the shield-shaped hollow beneath the stop-ridge, is characteristic of the Acton Park phase, dating from c. 1400 - 1200 BC. This appears to be the first palstave of this type from Oxfordshire to be recorded on the PAS database. Identical examples are illustrated by Rowlands (1976: plate 34, nos. 1099, 1097, 1129) described as chisels dating to the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.715238","fourFigureLon":"-1.407946","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"February 12, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.88","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Northmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/Benning palstave.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"120.85"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
