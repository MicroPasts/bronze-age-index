The head is leaf-shaped and the socket has a pronounced midrib. The mid rib is lozenge shape and extends to the base of the socket where it is slightly facetted rather than raised. The edges of the blade have been damaged in some places. One of the string loops are is complete and the other is broken. The mouth of the socket is broken, probably in antiquity.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a string loop type, which suggests later middle Bronze Age to early late Bronze Age date.
