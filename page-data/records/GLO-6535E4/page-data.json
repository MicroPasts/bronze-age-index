The remaining copper alloy objects are undiagnostic metalworking waste or associated stones. The gold bar is also undiagnostic but the gold coiled bar is paralleled in Middle Bronze Age Towednack hoard, Cornwall (Hawkes 1932) which can also be provisionally dated to the Penard metalwork phase (c. 1300-1100 BC). The presence of this gold ornamentation together with the dating from the narrow-bladed looped palstave places this hoard within the gold phase of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' (Roberts 2007). The presence of gold ornaments deposited together with copper alloy palstaves during this period has been recorded in several hoards throughout southwest England such as Winterhay Green, Somerset (Rowlands 1976, 256).\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nHawkes, C.F.C. 1932.
