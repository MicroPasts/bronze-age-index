BC 1600  to c.BC 1000.\n\n\n\nAround 25% of the palstave is present, consisting of the butt of the axe. The fragment is broadly trapezoidal in plan with a broadly H shaped cross section. Both front and reverse faces are concave which denote the beginnings of the raised flanges, which taper out towards the break. No traces of decoration are visible. Both the front and reverse faces show signs of wear and there are areas of the patina missing. The break appears to be patinated suggesting object was broken in antiquity. \n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 26.0 mm in length and is 24.7 mm wide (at the break) and 22.5 mm (at the butt end). It has a thickness of 7.8 mm (at the break) and 4.9 mm (at the butt end). It weighs 23.7 g. \n\n\n\nThe fragment is a mid to dark green in colour, with the front face being dark green and the reverse is mid green, with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail, and damage to the remaining patina.\n\n\n\nDue to the fragmentary nature of the object it is difficult to assign type. However the fragment does appear indicative of a Palstave axe rather than a developed axe. Other examples of Palstave fragments of this type have been recorded on the database WILT-A17D02, SUSS-4AE576 and WMID-EBF4D9.","fourFigureLat":"52.33692634","fourFigureLon":"-2.19221822","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"December 20, 2014","datefound2":"December 20, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chaddesley Corbett","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wyre Forest","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMID2AE0E1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
