The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade. Two rivet holes to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, both of which still retains its rivet; the rivet is 16mm long with a 9mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The sides of the blade are straight and gradually taper to the point, running down the length of the blade on both sides is a very low central spine. Post depositional corrosion has resulted in shallow notches being removed from the side of the blade and much of the edge of the butt, plus small patches of active bronze disease are present, but otherwise this item is in very good condition with a light green patina over most of the artefact.\n\n\n\nDirks and rapiers of this style are classified as belonging to Group 2 in Burgess, C., and Gerloff, S. 1981, 'The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland'.","fourFigureLat":"51.34620906","fourFigureLon":"-2.66185236","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"October 31, 2016","datefound2":"December 01, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winford","county":"North Somerset","district":"North Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO7EFE1A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"197"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
