It is sub-circular in section.","fourFigureLat":"51.939442","fourFigureLon":"-0.386698","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julian Watters","datefound1":"September 30, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.5","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Lilley","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"North Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jwatters/awl031000b.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Verulamium museum","length":"60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
