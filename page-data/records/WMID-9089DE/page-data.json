The upper end is square, and exhibits signs of being struck. The lower end is rounded, with old breaks. It expands in width from the lower end up to the square upper end. There are slight concave depresions on each face below the square upper end. Both front and back faces are undecorated.\n\n\n\nIt measures 90.3 mm in length, 16.3 mm wide (top), 10.1 mm wide (lower end), 16.0 mm thick (top) and 5.2 mm thick (lower end). It weighs 94.0 g.\n\n\n\nThe possible chisel is a dark green to brown colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nA couple of similar possible chisels have been recorded on the PAS database, including: SUR-DFA787; LANCUM-17104C and NLM-5232B6. Chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The attention to detail with the decorative facets around the head, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"52.7685382","fourFigureLon":"-1.8828698","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mavesyn Ridware","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID9089DE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"90.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
