The mouth of the socket is missing (with a surviving depth of 31.4mm) and is open on one face but appears to have been of sub-circular to oval (with a maximum surviving internal diameter of 8mm). The socket defines a prominent midrib on the more complete face (giving a maximum surviving thickness of 7.5mm). On either side of the midrib, the beginnings of the blade are evident but are heavily truncated (with a maximum surviving width of 13.3mm). There is the suggestion that the blade edges begin just above the break and if correct, implies a spearhead of comparatively small size. The tip is missing and the spearhead is of pointed oval section at the break (8.8mm wide and 4.3mm thick). The surface is heavily-corroded but remnant traces of a dark brown patina survive on the side of the midrib and displays filing or sharpening striations running along the blade.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary aspect and poor preservation of the artefact makes any identification difficult, the general form however is consistent with Middle Bronze Age spearheads and the suggested scale may tentatively suggest a spearhead of side-looped type and of Acton Park metalworking, dating to c. 1600 - 1400BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.42135531","fourFigureLon":"-3.33888791","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llancarfan","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.195.1jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"47.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
