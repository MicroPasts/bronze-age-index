The object is a single cast chisel with a flat terminal that widens towards the middle of the piece before tapering down to a point. The wider end terminates in a worn break, and is slightly bent inwards. The point is likely the tang of the object to be inserted into a wooden handle, and is roughly square in section. There is a slightly thicker collar below the tang. The object is undecorated, is mid to dark green in colour and has an uneven patina. Abrasion, caused by movement within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some original surface detail.\n\n\n\nSmall chisels and tools of this type were used for an extensive period of time, not simply in the Bronze Age, but also in later periods for jewellery making and fine work. As such dating the object is difficult.\n\n\n\nThe object is 74.75mm long, 14.11mm wide and 6.93mm thick. It weighs 17.4g.","fourFigureLat":"52.83943128","fourFigureLon":"-2.50618692","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Aimee Hinds","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Aimee Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.93","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stoke upon Tern","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ahinds/WMID628A80.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"74.75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
