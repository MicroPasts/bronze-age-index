The fragment is rectangular in plan and lozenge-shape in cross section - this being typical of the Bronze Age. The edges of the blade are narrow, rounded slightly and uneven, with minor patches of damage in places. The corners are also rounded. The shape of the blade is not quite parallel with one end being slightly wider than the other, but overall it has a relatively even profile. Both surfaces have a mid-brown patina while the edges are a mid-green. The blade measures 56mm in length. The narrower end is 18mm in width and 5mm thick, and the wider end 19mm wide and 5.5mm thick. It weighs 28.32 grams.\n\n\n\nSeveral similar blades are recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database, all of which date to the Middle Bronze Age. This includes examples from Wiltshire (WILT-9D21F1, WILT-90C8FE) and West Sussex (SUR-750511).","fourFigureLat":"51.7788264","fourFigureLon":"-0.47940934","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"January 01, 2018","datefound2":"August 30, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Gaddesden","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"Dacorum","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BHE1E7E6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
