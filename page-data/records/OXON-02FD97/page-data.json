Less than 25% of the socketed axehead is present, and consists of part of the mouth. The rest is missing, presumed lost in antiquity,\n\n\n\nThe mouth has a rolled rim followed by a transverse collar made of two concave depressed region divided by a slightly expanded collar.  The fragment is very work on all ages suggesting it was broken in antiquity. The inside of the socket has several linear scratches and the entire object has a light green patina.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is 30mm long, 23mm wide, 6.5mm thick and weighs 14.38 grams.\n\n\n\nToo little is present of this socketed axehead to determine what type it was, but it is definitely of Late Bronze Age dating c. 1150 cal BC to c. 750 BC.
