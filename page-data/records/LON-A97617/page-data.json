There is a pronounced mid rib extending to the tip with the blade wings projecting from each side. There is a rough irregular break across the width. The break reveals that the spear head is solid with no trace of the socket. Jon Cotton suggests this is probably the tip from a side-looped socketed spear head. Dimensions: length: 73.84mm; width: 20.02mm; thickness: 9.02mm; weight: 16.69g. Identification by Jon Cotton, Senior Prehistoric Curator Museum of London.","fourFigureLat":"51.46040223","fourFigureLon":"-0.21650964","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jon Cotton","datefound1":"November 01, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being declared not Treasure","recorder":"Kate Sumnall","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.02","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"East Putney","county":"Greater London Authority","district":"Wandsworth","regionName":"London","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ksumnall/Wells - spearhead illustration - 09.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of London","length":"73.84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
