The anvil survives as a square body with two shanks from two of the straightish edges. Each shank is slightly pointed but very worn so full length is uncertain, each of the two 'blank' edges of the square body may be a break likely indicating further possible shanks or beaks but wear and patination obscures the detail. One maybe a V-Shaped working surface but it remains uncertain. One of these shanks may have been used to secure the anvil in wood and the other/s are likely to be a 'beak' designed for working metal into a curve. The surface of the anvil is mostly heavily pitted and a light green colour with an occasional small areas of smooth dark green.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 61mm long, 52mm high, 15.51mm thick and 118.85g in weight","fourFigureLat":"51.15333176","fourFigureLon":"1.13020128","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-801","notes":"Ehrenberg (1981) listed only 36 examples of Bronze Age anvils from Europe (inc. 4 from Britain) in her catalogue and although others have been discovered since then but they remain a rare class of object, including one on the PAS database @ NMS-15E1DC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"52","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.51","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Elham","county":"Kent","district":"Shepway","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT0278AC.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
