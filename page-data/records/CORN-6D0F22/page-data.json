The sides then narrow slightly beyond the stop ridges before flaring into a angle-sided, wedge-shaped blade with an asymmetrical, slightly curved cutting edge.&nbsp;The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and the side flanges of the butt are lozenge-shaped, tapering from the stop ridge to the end.&nbsp;The stop ridge is higher than the flanges and slightly curved. Below the stop ridge on both sides of the palstave&nbsp;are a pair of&nbsp; ribs forming a V-shape. There are two circular idents on one side of the palstave indicating that there could have been a side loop. The casting flashes on the long sides have been trimmed and hammered flat - this along with the worn cutting edge suggests the axe was functional and used. The surfaces are pitted and corroded with very little original surface remaining.\n\nMeasurements:&nbsp;Length, 169.57mm; Width (cutting edge), 57.08mm; Thickness (cutting edge), 4.38mm; Width (butt end), 24.61mm; Thickness (butt end), 5.66mm; Width (of stop), 35.89mm; Weight,&nbsp;510.2g\n\nA similar palstave can be seen in&nbsp;DOR-BF8EF3 which notes:&nbsp;\n\n&#39;Ed Caswell has kindly commented that this palstave,&nbsp;following Schmidt and Burgess (1981) typology, would be a class 3 (low flanged) palstave dating to 1400-1100 cal&nbsp;BC. He adds that as this is a find&nbsp;from the South West, a more suitable attribution&nbsp;would be&nbsp;Rowlands (1976) Class 1 (Developed shield pattern) group 5a (Hampshire variant) which again dates to c. 1400-1100 cal&nbsp;BC. and notes good examples as&nbsp;Hoard 158,&nbsp;palstave 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoard 72,&nbsp;palstave 5 and in particular&nbsp;&nbsp;Class 3 (Birchington type), no.663 (ibid).&#39;","fourFigureLat":"50.26946043","fourFigureLon":"-5.2148893","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tasha Fullbrook","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Agnes","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tashamfullbrook/CORN6D0F22.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"169.57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
