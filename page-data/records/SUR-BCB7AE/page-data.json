Possibly a harness component; however such simple objects found in isolation are very difficult to attribute to a specific function or date.","fourFigureLat":"51.10369496","fourFigureLon":"-1.38722238","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Finder applying for an export licence","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"27.4","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Crawley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURBCB7AE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
