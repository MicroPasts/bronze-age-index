The socket is broken just below the base of the blade wings in a diagonal break that appears quite deliberate. The socket extends c. 28.3mm into the fragment. The midrib is more rounded on one side of the blade and has a more obvious ridge on the other. At the break to the blade a lozengiform cross-section is revealed, with the midrib section continuing in tapering flat triangles to each side. The bevel to the outside edges of the blade is c. 3.0mm. Naturally the loops are adjacent to the midrib, but almost seem like an afterthought rather than an integral feature. They are formed within a heavily scored area extending c. 30mm up the blade from the socket/blade junction. The perforations forming the loops begin between around 8 and 12mm up from the junction respectively. They are thin and oval. On the outer edge there is no integral loop plate. The unusual characteristics of this spearhead make its attribution as a basal-looped type tentative, although an example illustrated in Savory (1980, 175; ref. 232) is comparable. The edges of the fragment are slightly abraded but the piece otherwise survives in good condition. It has a general dull-grey patina with a few patches of green corrosion product, particularly at the break to the blade.","fourFigureLat":"51.087036","fourFigureLon":"-1.744382","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pitton and Farley","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-FE1C52spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"41.25"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
