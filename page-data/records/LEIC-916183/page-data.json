The object is rectangular in form and cross section and is intact, with slight damage to its butt end and some of its surface.\n\n\n\nThe butt end is rectangular in form and triangular in cross section, with each face having a rectangular shaped recess with a raised border to contain the handle. The blade, which has an elongated triangular cross section, tapers in width from the point it joins the butt. Overall it is 20mm wide and rectangular in form, then flares out to form a curved cutting edge 32mm wide at its flared tip. On each narrow side, just below the butt recess, is a small triangular recess with a slightly raised border. Further along the blade edge are diagonal ridges/ripples formed at casting. The object is otherwise plain.\n\n\n\nThese are very rare objects, this example being the sixth on this database, but this is the second from Leicestershire, with one being found in Swithland LEIC-58C955. Other similar examples are from Warwickshire WAW-FLB395 and Wiltshire WILT-DBCAF4 and on this example Brendan O'Connor commented: 'This is a type known to Evans (Ancient bronze implements, p 85, figs 70-1). One of these is illustrated by Rowlands, The production and distribution of metalworking the Middle Bronze Age in southern Britain, pl 34, 1110'. Two further examples have been found in Crosby Ravensworth, Cumbria LANCUM-5CE338 and Gisburn in Lancashire LANCUM-64B7A7.","fourFigureLat":"52.68237478","fourFigureLon":"-0.87722075","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"March 08, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Joyce Lee","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Owston and Newbold","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Harborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jmlarch84/LEIC916183.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"140"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
