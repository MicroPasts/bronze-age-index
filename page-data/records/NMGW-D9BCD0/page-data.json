The spearhead has a surviving height of 82.6mm and a maximum external diameter at the mouth of 18mm. The sides of the socket converge comparatively sharply towards the beginning of the blade. The socket continues along the blade to form a prominent rounded midrib. The sides of the socket are slightly pronounced and have the suggestion of side or socket loop stubs approximately 11mm apart. Much of the socket on one face is missing; some of this may be the result of miscasting (where the core has been incorrectly aligned), rather than later damage. The socket has a surviving depth of 63mm. The remnants of the blade are evident on both sides, but little of the blade survives. The spearhead weighs 25.6g (after cleaning).","fourFigureLat":"51.989427","fourFigureLon":"-3.880075","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.646) and classed within his Group 6 Developed side-looped, though due to this objects incompleteness it could not be assigned a sub-type. Davis (2012) notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades, which might strengthen the idea that this spearhead originally had a flame-shaped blade, rather than a leaf-shaped blade. The spearhead is likely to have been quite short and can be paralleled with a number of similar examples in National Museum & Galleries of Wales' collections (Savory 1980, Nos. 227-230).\n\n\n\nA side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has recently been dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating. However, overall Davis (2012, 108-110) places this group within the Taunton-Penard metalworking phases.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"18","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanwrda","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/DSCN3029.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"82.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
