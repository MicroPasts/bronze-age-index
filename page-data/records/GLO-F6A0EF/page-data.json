The rod is thickest at its centre and thinnest at the terminals.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Weight: 8.44g; Diameter: 22mm by 22mm; Thickness: 5mm (max.) - 1mm (min.)\n\n\n\nMetal composition:\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the ear-ring carried out by the British Museum's Department of Scientific Research indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-87 % gold, 11-12 % silver and at least 1% copper. The ear-ring weighs 8.44 grams.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nGold rod with square cross-section is a typical feature of both Middle and Late Bronze Age British ornaments (cf. Eogan 1994), but is rarely found in other periods. The precise form of the gold loop is not closely paralleled by other known examples bar and usual copper alloy penannular ring found in Hampshire (PAS-HAMP114), also of uncertain but probably later Bronze Age in date. The metal composition does not disagree with this statement. It is possible, on the balance of probabilities, to accept this as a prehistoric object.","fourFigureLat":"51.54486289","fourFigureLon":"-2.49168582","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Neil Wilkin","datefound1":"January 03, 2016","datefound2":"January 03, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Iron Acton","county":"South Gloucestershire","district":"South Gloucestershire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLOF6A0EF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"22"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
