The butt is evenly-rounded, giving the blade a maximum width at the base of the blade of 18.9mm). There are small rounded indents beneath the start of the blade edge, possibly remnants of rivet notches to secure the handle. The butt is thinned (with a minimum thickness of 0.8mm) and reaches its maximum thickness (of 2.5mm) near the midpoint of the blade. The butt is flat across its width, while the blade appears to have had a rounded central ridge. The original blade edge and tip have been lost. The surface is very-heavily pitted and has a pale to mid-green patina.\n\n\n\nMetallurgical analysis was undertaken[1] using X-Ray fluorescence, which demonstrated the alloy is a tin-bronze with trace elements of iron, lead, zinc and arsenic detected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] By Mary Davis; Principal Analytical Services Officer at Amgueddfa Cymru","fourFigureLat":"51.57616574","fourFigureLon":"-3.15583022","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rudry","county":"Caerphilly","district":"Caerphilly","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20161587.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"47.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
