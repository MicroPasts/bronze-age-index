It exhibits a narrow butt (31mm in width, 9.7mm in thickness). The body is slender and expands along its length to a width of 51.7mm. The sides exhibit high, inward-curved flanges forming a lenticular profile (maximum thickness 23.6mm, tapering to 12.1mm at the top of the blade). Most of the surface is now heavily corroded and pitted. \n\n\n\nThe blade expands obliquely from either side of the axehead at the point the flanges terminate, forming a crescentic cutting edge (width: 83mm). This has been somewhat abraded and is now obscured by corrosion product.\n\n\n\nIt has a low bevel or ridge about halfway down the septum (c.39mm from the butt), which indicates the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. This is clearer on the better preserved face of the axehead.","fourFigureLat":"52.65795714","fourFigureLon":"1.66561107","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"January 15, 2019","datefound2":"January 15, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Filby","county":"Norfolk","district":"Great Yarmouth","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/63217_91DAA7_MBA_FlangedAxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"134.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
