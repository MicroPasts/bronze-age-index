The strap distributor is sub rectangular in shape with a rectangular openwork centre. There are four spherical knops at the junction of each angle, with a bar in between each. The bar is oval in cross section. Either side and at the base of one of the spheres the metal has been very worn, suggesting that may have been attached or held something. The strap distributor is a dark brown colour, with patches of light brown red corrosion. The spherical junctions have a light green patina. It measures 22.5mm x 22.8mm x 9.0mm, and weighs 12.67g.\n\n\n\nThe strap distributor is similar to one of the objects in WILT A74356 (object 7), although only half survives. This is described as a toggle, and is dated from the late Bronze age to early Iron Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.8739332","fourFigureLon":"-0.95556823","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"November 28, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Quainton","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC6D8ACD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"22.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
