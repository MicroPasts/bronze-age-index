It probably can be assigned to Davis's Group 6 'Developed side looped' type (Davis 2017). It has a narrow blade measuring 44mm in length and 18mm in width. The tip is missing and the break is very worn and patinated suggesting it broke in antiquity; the base of the fragment also shares the same patina. Most of the spear head is missing.\n\n\n\nDavis R (2017) Later Prehistoric Finds Group Object Datasheet No.5; A Short Guide to Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads\n\n\n\nClass: Davis Group 6","fourFigureLat":"53.0648949","fourFigureLon":"-0.50912783","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Temple Bruer with Temple High Grange","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN9E4468.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
