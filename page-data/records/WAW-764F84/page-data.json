The blade has straight sides and only slightly flared blade tips. The cutting edge is blunt, and is slightly convex. The casting seam is visible on the sides, forming a slight triangular profile. One face of the axe has three parallel ribs visible, the other face has traces of these ribs, but they are not as clear. The socket is rectangular with rounded corners, but is off-centre therefore making the wall on one face very thin.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the axe has been over cleaned and has what are through to be recent scratches across the surface. There are two small patches of a heavy dark brown coloured patina, whereas the remaining surface is a mottled mid to dark green and brown colour. Despite the over-cleaning the axe is in a stable condition.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 48.38mm in length, 41.79mm in width and 16.05mm at the thickest point, and weighs 93.5g.\n\n\n\nThe axe dates to the Ewart Park phase, and, due to the three parallel ribs extending to the blade face, is possibly a South Welsh or South Western type dating to c. 950 - 800 BC. Similarly decorated axes are illustrated in Savory (1980, Figure 25).\n\n\n\nSavory, H.N. 1980 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections National Museum of Wales: Cardiff","fourFigureLat":"52.0314004","fourFigureLon":"-2.04514052","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"December 31, 1943","datefound2":"December 31, 1985","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carina Hughes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Beckford","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW764F84.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"48.38"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
