The object is broadly flat, triangular in shape and rectangular in cross section. The 'tang' is narrow and gradually widens before flaring outward to form a slightly convexly rounded flat blade. One surface of the tang is corroded and has a white residue while the edge of the blade is uneven and damaged slightly but worn. The entire object has a patchy light and mid-green patina. The chisel measures 39mm in length. The pointed terminal of the tang is a maximum width of 1.5mm in width and thickness. The blade is 16.8mm at its widest and 1.2mm thick. It weighs 7.53 grams.\n\n\n\nA number of similar objects are recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database, all dating from the middle to late Bronze age (e.g. IOW-C695CB SUR-6751DB, SOM-589161, NMS-5EB338 and LEIC-90F47D).","fourFigureLat":"51.22702945","fourFigureLon":"-1.01323871","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"October 10, 2018","datefound2":"October 10, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upton Grey","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH5D8656.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
