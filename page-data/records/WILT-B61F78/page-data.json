Undecorated and lozengiform in cross section, tapering at either end into unelaborated terminals.\n\n\t\n\n\tDiameter 80.8mm; width 7.2mm; thickness 5.6mm; weight 46.06g.\n\n\t \n\n\t\nA fragment of a copper alloy bracelet/armring, representing one terminal and part of the loop. The fragment consists of a bar of copper alloy, curved in profile, truncated by a fresh break at one end. Undecorated and plano-convex in cross section, with a prominent casting seam on the interior face and on the terminal. The terminal is unelaborated and sub-rectangular.\n\n\n\n\n\nLength 60.8mm; width 10.1mm; thickness 6.6mm; weight 28.32g.\n\n\n\n\n\t\nA copper alloy bracelet/armring, consisting of a copper alloy bar bent around into a loop, now sub-oval in plan and bent out of shape. Undecorated with a lozengiform cross section, with slightly expanded pad-like terminals. \n\n\n\n\n\nWidth across loop 93.9mm; width 7.8mm; thickness 6.8mm; weight 44.31g. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: \n\n\n\nThe bracelets/armrings described above can be best paralleled by objects from Ornament Horizon hoards of the Taunton phase (c.1400-1300 BC). During this phase many bracelets are more elaborate in the form or decoration (e.g. Rowlands 1971), and the Rockbourne examples are plain. They are, nevertheless, well paralleled by finds from the Monkswood hoard, Somerset (Smith 1959, Inv Arch GB. 42 2(1) & 2(2), see nos. 3-7), the Brading Marsh hoard (Isle of Wight), Hampshire (Rowlands 1976, 238), and Ebbesbourne Wake hoard, Wiltshire (Rowlands 1976, 271-21). For wider discussion of the ornament horizon and deposition of bracelets/armrings see Roberts (2007) and Wilkin (2017). \n\n\n\nOnly fragments 1 & 2 have precise find spots, with these being very widely dispersed within the same field. Despite this, it is unlikely that three bronze age armlets of similar form would be separately deposited within such a small area, and on the balance of probability the group either represent a hoard disturbed by later cultivation, or were deposited as part of the same process. \n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n\nAs a find of three copper alloy objects of prehistoric  date, objects Nos. 1-3 qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002)\n\n\n\nWil Partridge\n\nFinds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire\n\nJuly 2019\n\n\n\nChecked and edited:\n\nNeil Wilkin, Curator, British Museum\n\nAugust 2019","fourFigureLat":"50.9973084","fourFigureLon":"-1.85887461","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1300","notes":"References:\n\nRoberts, B. 2007.
