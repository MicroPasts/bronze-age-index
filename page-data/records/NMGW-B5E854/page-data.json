Originally, the spearhead was probably around 220-230mm long. The point of maximum width on this blade is low and the blade edges follow a smooth curve from the blade/socket junction to the spear tip. The spearhead mid-rib is angled, providing a sub-lozengic cross-section. The mid-rib sides have very slightly concave profiles on the lower blade and near where the midrib merges into the top of the socket. The blade has a bevel which is a maximum of 3.5-4.0mm wide, surviving best on the lower blade sides. On one side of the socket, half of a peg-hole survives at the lower break, being approximately 5.7mm in diameter. A small socket wall fragment was detached and embedded within soil remaining inside the socket when reported and this was separated as the excess soil was removed in the conservation laboratory. The spearhead shows evidence of deliberate narrow blade damage in antiquity. On one face and mid-way down the mid-rib, there is an angled narrow blade impact. This has revealed the cavity down the hollow centre of the rib, also causing the whole spearhead blade to have been bent in side-section. Secondly, on the socket, there is evidence of one, possibly two, similar angled impacts with a narrow-bladed weapon or tool, causing a break and distortion in the socket wall. Finally, on one upper blade edge, there is a deep nick in the blade bevel, approximately 1.5mm deep and 1.5-2.0mm wide, which looks to have been made in antiquity. On both sides, there are areas of surface scraping, as if by glancing blows. One of these has revealed fresh bronze, suggesting this damage may be recent. The spearhead has a dark green patina on the blade, merging to brown on the socket. The upper blade surfaces are part covered with green and blue surface corrosion concretions.\n\n\n\n\nSword blade of Carp's Tongue Type - fragment (metal-detector find 3)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Maximum surviving length 133.2mm; max. blade width 45.5mm; blade width near break 1 42.8mm; blade width near break 2 42.5mm; max. blade thickness 8.7mm; width mid-ridge 14.0-15.0mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 160.0g. \n\n\n\nThis is a blade fragment of a bronze straight-sided sword. The sword has a rounded midrib, precisely defined by single grooves, 0.2-0.3mm wide, which follow the outline of the blade. The blade edges are defined by blade bevels, approximately 3.5mm wide. In places, there are striations along the blade bevel, indicating the blade edges were prepared for use. Original blade edges survive in short sections, however the edges and bevels are damaged through fragility and corrosion. Near one of the blade breaks, there is local distortion of the blade, the blade being distinctly bent in side view. This suggests the bending was caused, as pressure was being applied to snap the sword. The blade has a grey-green patina, with areas of blue corrosion surface concretions evident. The concretions are particularly marked and thick on one face (approximately 2.5mm thick), suggesting the blade may have been in direct contact with another bronze artefact in the hoard, as buried.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Wales Type socketed axe - complete (metal-detector find 8)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 101.9mm; blade width 53.4mm; width body below loop 41.6mm; external mouth dimensions 49.1mm (side to side) by 39.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 34.7mm (side to side) by 26.6mm (front to back); dimensions runner stub (1) 7.2 by 3.7mm, height 0.3mm; dimensions runner scar (1) 6.4mm by 3.2mm; depth of socket approx. 68.0mm; width loop 6.1-6.9mm; weight (prior to conservation) 388.8g. \n\n\n\nA complete, bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a near rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides, splaying slightly towards the blade end. The loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding and is narrow. The runner stubs and scars are barely visible around the mouth, however slight ridges on the front and back sides, and a slight scar on the loop side, suggest that this axe was probably cast using a four-runner casting technology. The exterior outline of the mouth is sub-rectangular and the interior outline is slightly more curved and approaching sub-oval in shape. On one side, on the upper mouth moulding beneath the mouth, there is a slight indent, as if the bronze has been cast slightly above a defined edge in the mould part. Three longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, though now partly obscured by surface corrosion deposits. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering after casting. The blade bevel is largely obscured by corrosion deposits, however there are slight striations both parallel and at right-angles to the blade edge in one small area, suggesting that the axe may have been sharpened for use. On both sides of the axe, there are green and blue patches of corrosion products, while the original surfaces have a grey-green patina. On one lower blade face, there are two small areas of thick blue-green concretions with flattened top surfaces, which may once have attached to the flat face of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Wales Type socketed axe - complete (small find number 7)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 120.1mm; blade width 55.1mm; width body below loop (including flashes) 47.0mm; width body below loop (excluding flashes) approx. 42.0mm; external mouth dimensions (including flashes) 61.2mm (side to side) by 47.3mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 37.0mm (side to side) by 31.6mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 9.0 by 3.6mm; height 0.1mm; (2) 8.0 by 4.0mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 9.2 by 4.4mm; height 0.3mm; (4) 9.6 by 3.4mm; height 0.1mm; width loop 4.8-5.2mm; depth of socket approx. 79.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 458.5g. \n\n\n\nThis is a complete and long, slender bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. This heavy axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides and there is no splaying or recurving near the blade edges. The loop is high and narrow, and descends from the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degree apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Three prominent and longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, extending nearly two-thirds of the way down the axe faces. Though near parallel to each other, they are not quite straight with very slight meanders evident. It is evident that this axe was never prepared for use and in just out of the mould state. The casting flashes down both sides are prominent and very sharp and the loop was never used. The blade edge was never hammered or sharpened for use and there is excess around the mouth top, which was never filed or hammered down. Large areas of the axe's surfaces are covered with blue corrosion products, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. On one upper face, there is a particularly prominent area of corrosion with flattened upper surfaces, which may once have attached to the flat faces of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. The original surfaces of this axe have a grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Wales Type socketed axe - fragment (metal-detector find 6)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 65.6mm; width body below loop 41.7mm; external mouth dimensions 50.2mm (side to side) by 42.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 35.3mm (side to side) by 29.5mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 13.4 by 4.8mm; height 1.3mm; (2) 11.7 by 6.1mm; height 1.5mm; (3) 12.3 by 3.0mm; height 0.2mm; (4) 10.7 by 3.5mm; height 0.1mm; width loop 5.1-6.6mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 135.9g. \n\n\n\nThis is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has straight but slightly divergent sides, but the lower body and blade end is missing. The high loop descends from the under-side of the mouth-moulding and is narrow. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in plan. Three prominent, longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, while the face edges are slightly curved, rather than angular. The lower break edge, in plan, indicates there was a misalignment in the placing of the internal mould-piece relative to the outer mould pair during casting, with one face-wall being notably thicker than the other. On the non-loop side of the axe, near the break edge and in the area of particular wall thinning, there is a crack or split in the metal, which meanders upwards onto one of the faces. This suggests that the axe may have failed and broken during use. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. The axe has a grey-green patina and there are small localised encrustations of green and blue corrosion products on the faces and mouth moulding.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Wales Type socketed axe - fragment (small find number 6)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 60.8mm; width body below loop 37.7mm; external mouth dimensions 48.0mm (side to side) by 40.8mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 31.0mm (side to side) by 25.7mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 8.5 by 2.8mm; height 0.7mm; (2) 8.0 by 2.6mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 8.5 by 4.0mm; height 1.0mm; (4) 8.1 by 2.8mm; height 0.5mm; width loop 4.1-5.2mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 179.2g. \n\n\n\nThis is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The upper sides are slightly concave and slightly divergent. The loop is narrow and low, emerging significantly below the underside of the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four prominent runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Three weakly defined and slightly divergent, longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. The casting flashes down both sides are prominent but blunted, indicating that they were hammered or filed down when the axe was prepared for use. On one face, near the break edge, there is a concave distortion and narrowing of the socket aperture, suggesting that this axe may have been struck with a blunt tool before being buried in the ground although no clear impact scar is visible on the surface remaining. The axe surfaces have extensive patches of blue corrosion products over upper faces, sides and mouth, suggesting that this axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Wales Variant Type socketed axe - complete (metal-detector find 2)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 80.9mm; blade width 49.2mm; width body below loop 37.2mm; external mouth dimensions 46.2mm (side to side) by 40.1mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 28.5mm (side to side) by 23.8mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 8.8 by 5.2mm; height 0.5mm; (2) 8.6 by 5.9mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 10.5 by 5.7mm; height 0.8mm; (4) 7.5 by 4.5mm; height 0.2mm; width loop 4.8-5.6mm; depth of socket approx. 62.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 255.2g. \n\n\n\nThis is a complete and small bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular-shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly straight and divergent sides, which splay outwards markedly near the blade edge. The loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding and is narrow. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Five very prominent, longitudinal and ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, extending a little over half way down the length of the axe faces. The central three ribs are parallel, while the outer ribs define and follow the face edges and are slightly divergent. The casting seams are visible though not prominent, suggesting hammering or filing as preparation of the axe. Striations on the blade-bevel, mostly running parallel with the blade-edge indicate that the axe was sharpened for use. Thick and prominent patches of blue corrosion products are evident on the faces and loop-side of the axe and suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. It is possible that the flat topped surfaces on the thick corrosion products present on one face of the axe may once have attached to the flat faces of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. The original surfaces of this axe have a green patina.\n\n\n\n\nRibbed socketed axe of South Wales Variant, with similarities to Type Sompting, Variant Roseberry Topping - complete (metal-detector find 4)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 114.5mm; blade width 50.5mm; width body below loop 37.2mm; external mouth dimensions 47.5mm (side to side) by 45.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 32.1mm (side to side) by 30.5mm (front to back); depth of socket approx. 84.0mm; width loop 9.6-11.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 400.0g. \n\n\n\nThis is a complete, large and heavy bronze socketed axe of blocky but slender proportions, with a pronounced, curved and onset collar, and an angular rectangular cross-section. The sides are slightly concave and divergent, giving a slightly flared form and with slight, but even widening near the blade ends. A wide and thick loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding. The external and internal outlines of the mouth are sub-square in plan and the axe has a deep front to back mouth. There are no clear runner stubs or scars evident around the mouth top. Five longitudinal and very pronounced ribs descend from the underside of the mouth moulding on each face, extending down two thirds of the length of the faces. The central three ribs are near parallel, while the outer ribs define and follow the face edges and are slightly divergent. On one face, there is a linear projecting ridge, between two ribs on the lower loop side, suggesting a flaw in the surface of the mould, from which the axe was cast. In side view, one of the faces has a marked 'bulge' or convex curvature half way down the face, suggesting an oddly shaped mould-half. The casting seams down each side of the axe are prominent but blunted, suggesting the seams were rapidly hammered down as the axe was prepared for use. On the blade bevel, there are striations parallel with the blade edge, indicating the axe was prepared for use. There are areas of concreted corrosion products on the sides and faces of the axe, of both green and blue colour, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before being buried. On one blade facet and on the lower loop side there are areas of concretion with markedly smooth upper surfaces, suggesting that this axe may have been placed immediately beside, and above or below other artefacts within the hoard group. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n\nCroxton Type socketed axe - fragment (small find number 8) \n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 52.7mm; width body below loop 35.7mm; external mouth dimensions 40.7 mm (side to side) by 36.6mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 30.5mm (side to side) by 25.1mm (front to back); width loop 6.8-7.8mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 114.8g. \n\n\n\nThis is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a deep and onset collar and a sub-rectangular shaped body in cross- section. The upper sides are straight and slightly divergent. The loop is relatively high and wide, descending from within the lower part of the mouth moulding. The mouth moulding is slightly concave and everted in side profile, with no thickening or globularity evident near the mouth. The mouth top is flat but slightly angled with a raised inner edge and the exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. No runner scars or stubs are visible on the mouth. On one face, three longitudinal, narrow and strongly convergent ribs are visible, descending from the lower margin of the collar. These are poorly spaced at their origin, with one rib on the loop-side much more widely spaced away from the other two, descending from far over onto the non-loop side. On the reverse side, the ribs are largely obscured by surface corrosion products, though the upper section of one convergent rib on the loop-side is visible. The casting seams are visible down each side of the axe, but have been carefully filed down. One side and mouth of the axe is heavily encrusted with blue corrosion products, suggesting the axe was burnt immediately before burial. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nSlender socketed axe - largely complete, two conjoining fragments (small find numbers 2 - small mouth fragment, and 5 - near complete axe)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nDimensions of largely complete axe (small find 5) : length 114.1mm; blade width 46.6mm; width body below loop 19.7mm; external front to back mouth dimensions (distorted) 36.0mm; internal front to back mouth dimensions (distorted) 29.2mm; thickness top of mouth 3.0-3.5mm; width loop 4.7-5.3mm; depth of socket (approx.) 62.0mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 171.4g. \n\n\n\nDimensions small mouth fragment (small find 2): surviving length mouth top to base 13.1mm; surviving width of mouth top 13.0mm; mouth thickness at top 2.9-3.5mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 1.1g. \n\n\n\nCombined weight (prior to conservation) 172.5g. \n\n\n\nThis is an unusual, largely complete and slender, bronze socketed axe, with a tear and distortion down the non-loop side, from the mouth and along the casting seam. The axe has an everted mouth with a trumpet form and a deep onset collar. The mouth is damaged and distorted, but appears to have been near circular in external plan, though slightly sub-rectangular in its internal shape, and the mouth looks to have once had a deep front-to-back mouth. The mouth dimensions cannot now be accurately measured due to later damage and distortion. A low-set and slender loop, with a markedly rectangular shaped bar, descends from beneath the collar.\n\n\n\nThe upper socket is straight-sided the sides converging slightly. Half way down the axe, there is a distinct step and change of angle in the side profile, where the lower blade widens on both sides to give a step-waist effect. The slender lower blade has concave sides, widening to give a flaring blade form. This appears to be a composite socketed axe, where a socket has been cast on to a re-worked Winged Axe (or just possibly a Late Palstave). The upper face margins of the socket are defined by distinct single linear grooves ending in line with a square-ended ledge-stop across each mid-face. This is located 8-9mm below the point of the widening step visible on each side, thereby creating an overlapping join between the winged-axe blade-end and the cast on socket. The casting seams are prominent, but flattened indicating rapid filing or hammering down and the seams on the socket and blade end are in exact alignment.\n\n\n\nThe socket and mouth was split down its non-loop side along the casting seam, suggesting an outward pushing force, causing a split and distortion. Towards the base of the side split are lateral tears extending round to each face. A small mouth fragment from the non-loop side has conjoins with both mouth breaks, indicating that the axe is complete, but damaged. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina, though with areas of thick blue concretions on upper faces, one lower blade and side and inside the socket, suggesting the axe was burnt immediately before burial. At the base of the tapering sub-rectangular shaped socket, there is a green corroded concretion down one side.\n\n\n\n\nSlender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Westow / Class D - complete (metal-detector find 5)\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 107.7mm; surviving blade width 44.8mm; width body below loop 27.3mm; external mouth dimensions 32.7mm (side to side) by 31.6mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 23.4mm (side to side) by 23.0mm (front to back); dimensions of probable runner stub 6.7 by 3.5mm; height 0.7mm; dimensions of probable runner scar 6.0 by 3.0mm; depth 1.0mm; depth of socket approx. 73.0mm; width loop 5.2-5.6mm; weight (prior to conservation) 204.5g. \n\n\n\nThis is a complete and slender bronze socketed axe with six facets and a deep, double mouth moulding. The sides are straight and slightly divergent with pronounced splaying and recurving at the blade-ends. The low and slender loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding. The upper margin of the mouth moulding is defined by two curved horizontal ridges separated by a narrow groove and likewise, the lower margin also has a pair of curved horizontal ridges separated by a narrow groove. The two pairs of ridges are themselves separated by a wider, slightly recessed and concave band, making for a complex and unusual mouth moulding in combination. The external and internal outlines of the mouth are circular in plan shape. On one face side of the mouth top, there is a noticeable projection and on the opposing side, at 180 degrees to this, there is a corresponding scar, suggesting the existence of one runner-stub and one runner-scar and the use of a two-runner casting technology. The facet edges on the axe have rounded edges. The casting seams down each side are prominent but blunted, suggesting they were only rapidly hammered or filed when prepared for use. On the blade bevel there are striations running both parallel and at right angles to the blade edge, indicating that the blade was prepared for use. The faces, sides and mouth moulding of the axe are covered with blue corrosion products, suggesting that the axe was burnt immediately before burial. On one upper face, an area of blue corrosion product has a markedly flat top surface, which may once have attached to the flat face of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. On the blade end, the original surfaces have a green patina, while on the upper faces and mouth, the original surfaces have a grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n\nSmall plain socketed axe similar to Type Portree / Eogan Class 2A - complete\n\n\n\n(metal-detector find 7) \n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 74.3mm; blade width 47.8mm; width body below loop 32.3mm; external mouth dimensions 39.3mm (side to side) by 32.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 30.1mm (side to side) by 25.3mm (front to back); depth of socket approx. 59.0mm; width loop 5.3-6.0mm; weight (prior to conservation ) 150.5g. \n\n\n\nThis is a complete small, plain socketed axe of bronze, with a relatively broad body. The axe has a sub-rectangular sectioned body and mouth. The axe has a deep onset collar, which is flaring or trumpet shaped in profile. A low set and narrow loop emerges from the underside of the collar. The sides of the axe are slightly concave and diverge slightly, with marked expansion and recurving of the blade edge. There are no runner scars or stubs evident around the mouth top. The casting seams down each side of the axe are visible, but have been hammered or filed down before use. On the upper blade faces, there are blunt hammer mark depressions, indicating the expanded blade was worked before use. Striations running parallel with the blade-edge also indicate the blade was sharpened for use. The axe has a grey-green patina, with thick blue and green surface concretions evident in patches on the collar and blade surfaces. The blue concretions suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before being buried. On one blade bevel, there is a particularly thick area of blue surface concretion, with a markedly smooth and flat upper surface, suggesting this axe may have been placed immediately beside and above or below other artefacts in the hoard group.\n\n\n\n\nCurved socket wall, undiagnostic - small fragment (small find number 1)\n\n\n\nDimensions: max. surviving length 11.0mm; max. surviving width 6.1mm; thickness 1.3mm; surviving weight 0.3g. \n\n\n\nThis is a small bronze curved socket wall fragment of undiagnostic form. Although probably once part of one of the artefacts in the hoard, no conjoin may now be discerned, the breaks being sub-rounded and not fresh looking. The curvature of the fragment is consistent with a socket wall. The original surfaces of the fragment have a grey-green patina, thought the breaks have powdery light green edges.","fourFigureLat":"51.82981621","fourFigureLon":"-2.94463804","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"April 10, 2015","datefound2":"April 16, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Adam Gwilt","gridSource":"GPS (From FLO)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grosmont","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/73798.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Wales","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
