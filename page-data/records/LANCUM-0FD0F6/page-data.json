Only the lower part of the blade and tip remain. The surface is smooth and the edge of the sword bevelled. There is a very slightly ridge along the centre of the blade and the cross-section is a rounded diamond-shape. The sword probably belonged to the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage or possibly the earlier Wilburton metalwork assemblage, but it is impossible to date it any more closely without the hilt present.
