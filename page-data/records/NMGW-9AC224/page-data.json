The sheet strip has been carefully folded over, to give an oval shaped cross-section, the internal edges around the interior diameter being separated by a gap of 1-1.5mm. The ring has been dinted, with a compression crimp in one place causing a small tear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ring finds parallel with both penannular gold rings and 'hair-rings' of the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1400-800BC), which are now generally thought to be either hair or ear adornments. Rings of twisted bar or circular rod construction tend to date to the Middle Bronze Age, while 'hair rings' covered with gold foil, electrum wire or plating are most common during the Late Bronze Age. This example may represent the transition between solid gold and foil construction, therefore as a potentially early example of a 'hair-ring', could date to as early as the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC). Semi-quantitative analysis of the ring indicates a very high gold composition, with a small percentage of silver and 1% copper. The ring was found in the lower fill of a ditch at the periphery of a settlement, providing important dating evidence for its occupation during the Later Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"53.287994","fourFigureLon":"-4.626791","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"September 30, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Adam Gwilt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"14.8","edge":null,"thickness":"3.7","discoveryContext":"Controlled archaeological investigation (stratified)","parish":"Trearddur","county":"Isle of Anglesey","district":"Isle of Anglesey","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smcfarlane/Trearddur 2007 07.23b.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
