The spearhead has a short but slender kite-shaped blade with only the very tip missing. The socket is circular and tapers from the open mouth in to the shaft between the blade's wings. There are two lozenge-shaped undrilled 'loops' located nearly equidistant between the socket mouth and the balde. The mouth of the socket is ever-so-slightly recessed from the main socket. A small number of spearheads with undrilled loops have recently been recorded from across Oxfordshire; from Kingston Bagpuize (BERK-5BCE29), another from Cherwell (BERK-D20304) and another example was found in AD 1871 in Fyfield and is now in the Ashmolean Museum (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706).","fourFigureLat":"51.71598429","fourFigureLon":"-1.58163349","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"February 12, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"21.2","edge":null,"thickness":"12.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bampton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017340b.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"137"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
