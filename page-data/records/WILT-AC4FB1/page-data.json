Part of the object is missing. The blade is leaf-shaped and lozengeform in cross-section, showing a prominent central ridge that extends into the old broken shaft. On one side is still visible the attachment point of the side loop which is incomplete from an old break. The spear head narrows from the tip to the shaft and measures 47.03mm in length and 14.59mm in width. The blade is 1.57mm in thick, the internal diameter of the shaft is 8.48mm and the spear measures 10.18g.\n\n\n\nThe spear is substancially smaller than the similar examples illustrated in Moore C.N. and Rowlands M.
