The axe has broken near the bottom of the socket, with one face surviving higher than the other. The blade edge has been lost but was slightly expanded. The remnants of casting flashes are visible along the sides and have been neatly finished. There is a suggestion of sharpening striations running along the blade edge. The more complete face possibly displays the bottom of a rib on its higher side.","fourFigureLat":"51.623388","fourFigureLon":"-2.897007","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 25, 2003","datefound2":"April 24, 2003","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Langstone","county":"Newport","district":"Newport","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn0856.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"26.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
