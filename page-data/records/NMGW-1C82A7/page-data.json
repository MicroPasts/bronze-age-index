The mouth is incomplete, with a little less than half surviving and appears to have been sub-rectangular (with surviving external dimensions of 33.0mm x 24.5mm and internal 22.6mm x 14mm, with socket depth of 40.0mm). The surviving part of the top of the mouth is irregular and two of the probable four casting runners are evident. There is a slight lip discernible at the mouth, above the rounded mouth moulding (with a length of 6mm and a depth of 4mm - 6mm). The loop springs from the moulding, just above the break and the stub of the lower return is evident (giving a loop length of 18.6mm). The sides of the axe are moderately straight, before diverging to the slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 33.2mm). The blade edge is largely straight (with a depth of 4.4mm) with minimal expansion. The sides of the axe are bevelled towards the centre, where the casting seam is evident but has been neatly finished. The faces appear to have been flat across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the blade edge. Both faces display evidence of damage from battering, possibly deliberately and the battering on the fragmentary face is likely to have removed its upper part. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, convergent on the complete face and near-parallel on the incomplete face but with irregularly placed. The blade edge has a distorted lip on the incomplete face, possibly from impact and is also suggestive of abuse.  The surface is corroded with a dark-green brown patina where it survives and elsewhere has corroded pale to mid-green.","fourFigureLat":"51.56318393","fourFigureLon":"-4.09328584","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pennard","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20172439.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"45.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
