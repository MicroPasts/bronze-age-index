Ehrenburg 1977 Class V; Penard - Ewart phase; Needham Period 6 – 7. Davis (2017) dates this type, 'generic' pegged, Davis Group 11, to the Late Bronze Age, 1100 – 800 BC.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead comprises a leaf shaped blade with chamfered edges and a conical socket with two circular peg holes; one to either side of the socket which are positioned in line with the blade. The edges of the blade are worn. Slight casting flashes are visible from the point at which the blade meets the socket to the mouth of the socket.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 90.5mm in length, 25.8mm in maximum width. The socket depth is 47.1mm, it is 22.8mm in diameter with walls which are 2.9mm thick. The spear weighs 41.9g.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid to dark brown patina with lighter green patches in delaminated areas.\n\n\n\nA similar spearhead has been recorded as LVPL-D726F2 in which it is noted that Ehremburg notes that there is a sub-classification that she calls 'short stumpy' types (p.15) which have a length of less than 100mm with the width of the blade being approximately 1/3 the length. Ehremburg suggests that these are from the Ewart Park (1000-750 BC Needham Period 7) assemblage.","fourFigureLat":"53.86360558","fourFigureLon":"-0.40484156","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"22.8","edge":null,"thickness":"2.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leconfield","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/ACH0004.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"90.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
