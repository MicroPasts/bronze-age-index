The butt ends in a transverse break at around the point where the flanges meet the septum, the width at this point is 21.5mm. The flanges are badly damaged and the original shape is uncertain. The septum is largely straight, with a very slight taper towards the butt, and is 5.6mm thick. The Flanges form a straight rectangular stop ridge, which projects above the maximum surviving height of the flanges (24.6mm). The palstave originally had a side loop on one side overlapping the stop ridge, now only visible as attachment scars.\n\n\n\nThe blade is fairly broad with concave edges expanding to flared tips (now damaged, one missing entirely) and a curved blade edge. A slight blade bevel is just visible, being roughly ??mm. A slight raised area running down the centre of the blade from the stop on both faces suggests that the axe had a poorly defined, now almost imperceptible midrib. No other decoration is visible. \n\n\n\nThe palstaveâ€™s surface is pitted with green to brown patchy colouring- the original surface is missing from the entire palstave with the exception of inside the flanges and on the septum, where it has a green patina. The flanges are very badly damaged, being almost entirely gone on one side, and showing fresh bronze, presumably from recovery damage.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 125mm; Blade width 55.9mm; Butt width: 21.5mm; Stop thickness: 29.8mm; Width at stops: 22.7mm; Flange thickness: 24.6; Weight: 293.1g.","fourFigureLat":"51.65473274","fourFigureLon":"-3.37466779","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1140","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"George Whatley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Abercynon","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/NMWPA2021381.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"125"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
