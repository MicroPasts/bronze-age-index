The top of the mouth (with a thickness of 5.4mm - 6.0mm) is corroded but a raised area is likely to represent the casting runner stub. The casting seam is evident running down the middle part of the side, from the runner stub and appears to have been prominent, possibly with minimal finishing. There is a weak collar discernible on the side (with a length of 16mm). Above the break, the casting seam is slightly raised and it is possible that it represents the remains of the top of a loop, although it would have been placed comparatively low in relation to the collar. The side fragment is near-straight, slightly concave. The interior of the axe is straight along its length and is curving to the faces on both ends (giving an internal width of approximately 20mm). The surface is heavily-corroded with a mid-brown patina.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature and lack of diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Socketed axes generally date from the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1150 BC - 750BC) but may also be of the Llyn Fawr phase (c. 800 - 650BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.15269716","fourFigureLon":"-3.03915768","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-650","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eardisley","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.42.2 jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"35.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
