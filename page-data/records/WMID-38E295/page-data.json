The spearhead can be described as a pegged leaf-shaped socketed spearhead with lanceolet blade and circular sectioned mid-rib. It dates from c. BC 1000 - BC 800.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has an elongated leaf-shaped blade, the edges of which are bevelled and still sharp. The very tip of the blade is damaged. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib. The midrib expands towards the base to form the socket, the socket has an internal diameter of 20.6 mm and the wall is 2.1 mm thick. Mid-way down the socket there are opposing circular peg holes, (measuring 5.4 mm in diameter). The blade is broadly leaf or flame shaped in plan, and in section the wings are triangular. The cutting edge is present and is bevelled. There doesn't appear to be evidence of use or sharpening on the surface. The wings taper in at the base towards the peg holes. There is a modern break situated about half way up the blade, and a piece missing from here on the reverse of the object. There is a triangular groove above the peg holes on the front face of the socket.\n\n\n\nThe tip part measures 86.3 mm in length and is 29.7 mm wide at base and 4.7 mm wide at tip. It has a thickness of 9.2 mm and weighs 41.0 g.\n\n\n\nThe socket part measures 117.5 mm in length and is 31.1 mm wide at top and 26.3 mm wide at base. It has a thickness of 14.5 mm and weighs 84.0 g.\n\n\n\nThe total length of the object is 196 mm. The maximum width is 31.3 mm and the maximum thickness is 14.5 mm. The total weight of the spear is 125.1 g.\n\n\n\nThe object is a mid green in colour with an uneven, but mostly shiny green patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail and some damage to the object. This object probably corresponds with examples from metal working phase I or II of the Late Bronze Age.
