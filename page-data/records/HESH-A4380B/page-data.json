The fragment consists of part of the lower blade a rapier, the tip has been previously recorded (HESH-3B6C58) and was recovered by a different finder from the same field. The two blade pieces conjoin and should therefore be considered as part of the same artefact. The fragment is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with one end being slightly tapered. A central ridge / mid rib runs along the length of the fragment on both faces. The rapier fragment is a mid-green colour with an uneven and eroded surface patina. The breaks are abraded therefore it is problematic to suggest if the rapier was deliberately broken prior to deposition or if it has been broken by farm machinery in the plough soil. However, this fragment in profile is noticeably bent, so it could be likely that the object has been purposefully bent before deposition. This could suggest that the object was subjected to a ritual process before being placed in the ground. The findspot looks to be close to the edge of a large mere or area of historic wetland - possibly suggesting that if this rapier were ritually disposed of it was then placed at a liminal boundary; this is a common feature of wetland deposition in prehistoric Britain. A direct parallel for the rapier blade cannot be attributed due to the fragmentary nature and lack of diagnostic features and so a broad Middle Bronze Age date is suggested.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 51.4mm in length, 18.0m width and is 17.4mm thick. It weighs 23.7 grams. When the two fragments are placed together they measure a total of 121.06mm and in total weigh 44.9 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.73185388","fourFigureLon":"-2.43089472","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Victoria Allnatt","datefound1":"August 10, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lilleshall, Donnington and Muxton","county":"Telford and Wrekin","district":"Telford and Wrekin","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vickyallnatt/HESHA4380B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"51.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
