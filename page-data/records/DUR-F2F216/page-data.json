It has broken before the shaft, having a rectangular cross-section at the broken edge where it is thickening. The axe has a dark brown patina which is slightly patchy due to corrosion.\n\n\nAs so little remains it is not possible to pin it down to a certain type of axe, or a more specific period within the Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"54.225102","fourFigureLon":"-0.559675","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.73","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brompton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Scarborough","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/frances/DUR-F2F216_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"22.33"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
