Only the lower portion of the blade is present, with a rectangular cross section, it has broken below the stop ridge. The sides are concave. A central ridge runs two thirds of the length of the front and back faces. The cutting edge is lost, but it still retains a convex form.\n\n\n\nThe palstave fragment measures 71.8 mm in length, 62.3 wide (at the blade), 23.8 mm wide (at the break), 15.7 mm thick (at the break) and 2.5 mm thick (at the blade). It weighs 182.0 g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave fragment is a mid brown to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of most of the original surface detail. All breaks are patinated.","fourFigureLat":"52.70536571","fourFigureLon":"-2.26783461","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Blymhill and Weston-under-Lizard","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID7D44CA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"71.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
