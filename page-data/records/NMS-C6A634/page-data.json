It is very worn and corroded, with all edges worn away and a lot of corrosion bubbles on the pitted surface. It is a long oval in shape, with both ends broken and/or worn so that they run straight across. The cross-section is pointed-oval, a maximum of 3.5mm thick in the centre where there is a very slight bulge to a barely-visible midrib. It flattens away from the centre, with one end 3mm thick and the other 2.5mm thick. The surviving width, with all edges worn, is 14mm and the surviving length 43mm. It weighs 7.23g. The corroded areas are light green and the small areas of surviving surface have a mid grey patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.66798053","fourFigureLon":"1.32617754","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-801","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Geake","datefound1":"October 21, 2019","datefound2":"November 18, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Beeston St. Andrew","county":"Norfolk","district":"Broadland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/PFd_37316_C6A634_NMD112019_BA_Knife_a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"43"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
