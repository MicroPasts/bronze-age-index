From this point it widens in a smooth concave curve down its length to reach it maximum width of 23.7mm at the blade's corners. The blade corners are damaged such that it is not possible to say it they were rounded or out-turned. The blade is a shallow crescent shape and is bevelled possibly suggesting it has been sharpened although the edge now is abraded and chipped. The axe is lenticular (a pointed oval) in cross section reaching it maximum thickness (3.1mm) approximately half way along its length. It's sides are very slightly upturned into almost imperceptible flanges. There is a casting floor close to its centre which exaggerates their size.\n\n\n\nThe object has a dark green patina which is chipped in pieces where it has a medium green patina.\n\n\n\nThe object is 43.7mm long, 23.7mm wide, 3.1mm thick and weighs 6.8 grams.\n\n\n\nThere are several very similar objects recorded on the database described as either chisels or miniature axeheads (LIN-9CD5CA, LEIC-90F47D,  BH-5D8656, WAW-353C3E, IOW-C695CB, SOM-589161). Many Late Bronze Age chisels share a similar form to this example although these often have projecting collars at their midpoint which this lacks however an example of a chisel from Netherhampton in the British Museum Collection (1998,0901.172) shows how these need not always be present. A similar find is also illustrated from Priory Farm Cave (Savory 1980, p.179, 265 nr. 2). As such a Late Bronze Age date and suggested use as a chisel is appropriate for this object. It should be noted however that while copper alloy woodworking tools are known from the Bronze Age such tools continue in use to the Post Medieval period for finer woodworking.","fourFigureLat":"51.68421301","fourFigureLon":"-0.85868259","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"March 06, 2022","datefound2":"March 06, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bledlow-cum-Saunderton","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Wycombe","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXONECB45F.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"43.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
