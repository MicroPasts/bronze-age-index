The other side of the object is undecorated and rounded, creating a semi-circular cross-section. The object is broken at either end due to old breaks and there is a visible casting flaw at one end, which appears to be a bubble.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 32.2 mm in length, 27.6 mm wide, 9.2 mm thick and weighs 44.1 g.","fourFigureLat":"51.23620482","fourFigureLon":"0.6916705","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Chestnutt","datefound1":"September 30, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Chestnutt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lenham","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cchestnutt/KENTA1C3D4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"32.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
