The cutting edge of the blade is missing, but enough remains of the side and blade to see that the blade curved down from a now missing projecting blade tip. The fragment measures 24.9mm from the broken tip to the break perpendicular to the blade edge.\n\n\n\nThe base of the socket is a maximum of 17.2mm from the broken blade edge, and measures 14.9mm in length from the side to the break. A fragment of one face survives projecting 8.9mm up from the base of the socket. The face wall is 4.6mm thick, while the remaining scar from the other wall is 3mm across, although possibly incomplete. \n\n\n\nOnly 10.6mm of one side remains, with possible flashing remaining, and a visible expansion to form the blade tip.\n\n\n\nThe extremely fragmentary nature of the object leaves too few diagnostic features to place it comfortably into a precise type, but a socketed axe like this likely dates to between Wilburton-Wallington and Llyn Fawr metalworking phases. Most socketed axes from South Wales date to the Ewart Park metalworking phase. The way in which this axe has been broken suggests intentional destruction.\n\n\n\nThe fragment has a green pitted patina with patches of bright blue corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.51124584","fourFigureLon":"-3.34152218","fromdate":"-1140","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"George Whatley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pentyrch","county":"Cardiff","district":"Cardiff","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20215231.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"18.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
