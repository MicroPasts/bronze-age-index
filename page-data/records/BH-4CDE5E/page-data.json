A pronounced stop ridge divides the haft from the blade end. Below this the edges narrow slightly and both faces are decorated with three raised longitudinal ribs that extend approximately a third of the way along each of the blade faces. The haft comprises just under half the length of the axehead with pronounced raised edges on either side, sections of which are broken or damaged in palces, that widen in profile to join the stop ridge. The flanges and end of the butt are broken but would have formed an H-shape cross-section. The result is a broadly sub-lozenge-shape profile that expands at the stop-ridge and arrows along the length of the blade. The casting flashes extending along the centre of each side are pronounced at the butt end and visible on each side of the blade but are much more worn. The loop, bridging the stop-ridge on one side, is lozenge-shape in cross-section and sits in line with the casting flash that extends along its surface.\n\n\n\nAll surfaces of the axehead have a relatively consistent mid-green and brown patina.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 140mm in length. The blade is 40mm wide and 1.8mm thick at the cutting edge. The stop is 23mm wide and 30.5mm at its thickest, and the butt is 22.2mm wide and 7.5mm thick. The entire object weighs 353 grams.\n\n\n\nThis palstave has features causing it to sit between several types. For example Schmidt and Burgess (1981: plate 59, no 815)  illustrate a similar example defined as a group 3 low flanged palstave sleaford type, which has a flared broader blade than this example, the short but narrow form is also similar to transtional types, although these tend to have plainer, if any decoration, while a very similar late example (plate 67 no.928) is identical albeit this example lack the diagnoasic projecting stop ridge typical of late palstaves. It maytherefore appropriate to suggest that this form may date from the as early as group 3 palstaves (c.1400 cal BC) into the Late Bronze Age wilburton period (1200-1000 cal BC) until a parallel within a hoard is identified. Rowlands (1976) does not illustrate any similar examples but focusses primairly on Middle bronze age forms which support a transtional/Late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.65130221","fourFigureLon":"-1.23532693","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"November 02, 2019","datefound2":"November 02, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clifton Hampden","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/AxeHead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"140"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
