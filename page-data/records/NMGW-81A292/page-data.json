The butt is damaged (18.5mm wide and 3.7mm thick), now pointed at the centre but is unlikely to have been much longer. The sides are straight and near parallel to below the stop (where the axe has a width of 19.9mm below the loop). The sides of the blade are divergent with a moderate curve before diverging more sharply to the blade tips, one of which is lost (giving a surviving blade width of 42.1mm). The blade edge has a moderately deep curve (with a blade depth of 15mm). The sides are flat across their thickness with the casting seam clearly evident but neatly finished. The loop is damaged (with a length of 18.8mm, a maximum thickness of 6mm and a surviving height of 5.6mm) and positioned near the position of the stop. The flanges are truncated but appear to have begun at or below the butt and have a linear top edge, reaching their maximum height at the stop (where the axe has a thickness of 25.6mm). The septum (with a surviving length of 39.5mm, a width of 14mm and a thickness of 5.5mm) is flat across its length and gently concave across its width. The stop is also gently concave with near vertical sides (with a height of 10.4mm). The faces are bevelled from the top of the stop to the face and are decorated with three ribs, a prominent linear central rib, flanked by weaker side ribs, curving from the edge of the sides towards the central rib before petering out by the mid blade face. The curved converging ribs perhaps suggest a trident variant design. The central rib extends all the way along the blade, reaching the prominent blade facet (12.6mm long). The original surface with a dark-brown patina has been lost over much of the surface and is fragile with a tendency to flake. \n\n\n\nThe palstave is of unusual form, particularly in relation to its small size but also with the curving ribs. The form may be best paralleled in Low-Flanged palstaves, perhaps a variant of Type Sleaford, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p136). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1500 – 1150BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
