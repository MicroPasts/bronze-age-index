The nature of the corrosion, with blue patches and analysis of past flat axes suggest the material is more likely to be copper rather than copper alloy. The axe is complete, but the surface has been heavily abraded, therefore only traces of a heavy green/brown patina. \n\nIn plan the axe is a sub elongated triangle. The butt is rounded, and in profile gradually tapers to a rounded edge. The sides are straight with no flaring outwards of the blade tip. The blade cutting edge appears to have been sharpened, suggesting the axe was functional rather than votive. In profile the blade forms a ‘>’. The cutting edge is symmetrical. \n\nThe axe measures 68.19mm long from the butt to the apex of the cutting edge. It is 32.61mm wide from blade tip to blade it, and is 6.03mm thick at its thickest point on the body. It weighs 47.6g.\n\nThe axe is a flat axe, which dates to the early Bronze Age, c. 2000 to 1600 BC. Watson (1993 Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums BAR British Series 233) illustrates similar flat axes, Nos. 115 and 116, but these have slightly flared blade tips.","fourFigureLat":"52.057628","fourFigureLon":"-1.578452","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Watson","datefound1":"August 11, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.03","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-049216.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"68.19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
