The sides of the axe flare at the blade end and the blade edge is curved. The base of the socket is clearly present. Too little of the axe survives to identify whether it was ribbed or plain and to type. The blade surfaces are worn and weathered, the break edges also being abraded. The axe has a dark brown patination.","fourFigureLat":"51.650247","fourFigureLon":"-2.911991","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"Too little of this socketed axe fragment survives to identify it to precise type, however as a socketed axe, it may be confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, between 1150-750BC (e.g. Savory 1980; Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Needham 1990; Needham et al 1997; Eogan 2000). The previously reported artefacts in the hoard, a ribbed socketed axe and a casting jet (produced when making a South Wales type socketed axe), were dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (950-750BC). Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that the blade fragment is contemporary with another two associated artefacts (Treasure case 03.17). The close vicinity of the finds with each other, at similar depth, and their common fragmented and weathered state, add weight to the likelihood that they were once buried together as a closed hoard group, being slightly disturbed by ploughing or forestry during the more recent past. Together, the composition and fragmentation of this hoard group would be entirely consistent with other hoards deposited in south east Wales at this time (Savory 1980; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004; Gwilt & Lodwick in prep).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"July 14, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanhennock","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH003183_02.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums and Galleries of Wales","length":"26.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
