The fragment consists of the tip of the spear blade, which is triangular in plan. The tip is slender with a pronounced middle rib which tapers to the edges in 'wings', creating a rounded lozenge-shaped cross section. The shaft opening is circular in shape on the underside and is completely filled with soil and other possible material, but seems to have been socketed. The metal is of a medium green colour, with substantial areas of darker green patina on all surfaces. The spear tip measures 39.5mm long, 14.5mm wide at the break and 6.7mm thick; it weighs 6.67 grams.\n\n\n\nAs only the tip of the spear remains, it is difficult to date this object more precisely than the Middle to Late Bronze Age period, c. 1500-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.82547658","fourFigureLon":"-0.46799343","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Liz Walker","datefound1":"December 16, 2015","datefound2":"December 16, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Liz Walker","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17.2","edge":null,"thickness":"0.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Angmering","county":"West Sussex","district":"Arun","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/unspecified16.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
