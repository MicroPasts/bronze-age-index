The blade end of the axe head survives and is trapezoidal in shape with a crescentic cutting edge. The corners are slightly flared and rounded. The socket of the axe is sub-rectangular measuring 24.3mm x 18.4mm. It has jagged breaks around all the sides which have removed the original end of the socket and no evidence of the original probable collar remaining. At one edge of the socket end of the axe head there is a small circular projection which was probably the remains of a loop that would have been attached to the socket. Casting seams are visible on the sides of the axe head. The blade edge has sporadic thick incised lines and indentations possibly from ware. The axe head has a mid-green patina.\n\n\n\nThe axe head is 52.7mm in length, 32.7mm in width, 20.4mm in maximum thickness, and weighs 67.51g.\n\n\n\nSimilar axe heads can be seen on the database such as: YORYM-82C3F7, NLM-7CDDD3, NLM-B70C26","fourFigureLat":"51.48587068","fourFigureLon":"-0.80603102","fromdate":"-1050","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helena Costas","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helena Costas","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Waltham St. Lawrence","county":"Windsor and Maidenhead","district":"Windsor and Maidenhead","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/helenacostas/BERK28CD29.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"52.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
