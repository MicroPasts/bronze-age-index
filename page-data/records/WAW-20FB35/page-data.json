It is made from cast copper alloy, and is a sub-triangular shape in plan. The tip is blunt, the lower edge is broken, but not recently. In section the object is a pointed oval shape. \n\n\n   \n   The dimensions are 29.8mm long, 10.1mm wide and 3.1mm thick.\n\n\n   \n   The surface is heavily pitted, and has traces of a heavy dark brown patina. It is this patina and pitting which perhaps suggests its prehistoric date.","fourFigureLat":"52.066511","fourFigureLon":"-1.549192","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"September 23, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-20FB35.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"29.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
