One end of the object terminates in a sharp point and has a circular cross section. The object widens at its centre and becomes increasingly sub-rectangular in section. The object has been flattened towards the tang end and becomes sub-rectangular in section. This end of the object is flat, however it is slightly rough which suggests it has been broken and the object is incomplete. The object appears to have been cleaned so has lost much of its patina.

However the record for a similar object - WMID-BA89E6 - states that, as awls are functional artefacts, their form changes very little from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval period. Similar awls were found during the excavations at York (Ottaway & Rogers, 2002, pages 2729-2730, fig 1338). Therefore such example could be of any date from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval Period (2150 BC to AD 1500).","fourFigureLat":"53.845032","fourFigureLon":"-1.271935","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Creighton","datefound1":"November 22, 2011","datefound2":"November 21, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Creighton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Towton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Selby","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucyc/PAS_2057_awl1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"56.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
