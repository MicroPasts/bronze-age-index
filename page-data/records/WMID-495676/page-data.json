The socket of the axe is sub-rectangular, with an irregular mouth. The top edge of the socket shows little evidence of casting jets that have been trimmed flush with the socket mouth. One of the four casting runners survives the extensive abrasion and can be clearly identified. The mould has slipped slightly during the casting process. The swollen moulded collar of the socket is relatively wide and varies in thickness along its length. At the base of the collar a small swollen rib extends. The loop is well preserved and relatively small and wide with a irregular lentoid shaped cross section. It is set in a low position on the axe being set beneath the collar in line with the horizontal moulding.The horizontal cast moulding is present on both faces and the edges of the axe; however this is better preserved on one face. From this moulding, on each face, three parallel longitudinal ribs descend. The ribs are complete and taper along their length terminating approximately in the middle of the axe. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade.The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion.\n\n\nThe socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion. Here a dark green coloured metal can be seen. Some of this exposed metal has a light green powdery copper corrosion present. The areas worst affected are those around the collar, socket and cutting edge. These areas of exposed metal should be monitored for signs of active corrosion (bright greeny powdery residue). To reduce the risk of this occurring, the axe head should be stored in an dry acid-free environment, such as a sealed tupperware box, with silica gel and acid free tissue paper.\n\n\nThe axe measures 101.15mm in length, 45.20mm wide, is 38.55mm thick and weighs 185.7 grams. The depth of the socket is 75.94mm.\n\n\nThis axe fits into a well known distribution of ribbed axes present in the Northern Marches (Shropshire) and north and East Wales. It can be paralleled with a similar socketed ribbed axe from Breiddon Hillfort (Powys) which was discovered during excavations. This also had a portion of preserved willow haft which was radiocarbon dated to the period 754 Â± 50 CAL BC(Musson 1991). This fits with the final phases of the Late Bronze Age specifically that associated with Ewart Park industrial phase. Similar discoveries of Socketed Axes (from which this example may be paralleled) can be seen in the Willow Moor Hoards (of 1790's and 1840's) from Little Wenlock, Shropshire (Chitty 1928). A similar axe was also discovered in a hoard of axes from Pencoyd, Herefordshire (2005-T412). This was also dated to the Ewart Park phase. These axes correspond in date with Needham's period 7 (Needham:1996) Very few Socketed axes have been discovered or reported from Shropshire in recent years so this example is particularly important to the understanding of Late Bronze Age Archaeology of the County.","fourFigureLat":"52.911467","fourFigureLon":"-2.477286","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-700","notes":"\nThanks are extended to both Dot Broughton (Cumbrian FLO) and Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) for their help with the identification and recording of this find.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"December 06, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"38.55","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norton in Hales","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-495676.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"101.15"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
