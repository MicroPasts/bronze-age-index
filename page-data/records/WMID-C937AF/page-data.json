The spearhead is sub triangular in shape. The socket is incomplete, presumed damaged in antiquity. The remains of the socket is circular, and extends 20.7 mm into the spearhead. The blades were probably originally triangular in shape. One appears to be complete, the other is damaged. The complete blade measures 61.9 mm in length, has a maximum width of 6.6 mm and the blade edge is 1.7 mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 68.6 mm in length, 19.4 mm wide and 10.9 mm thick. The width at the tip is 3.1 mm and it is 2.7 mm thick. It weighs 15.1 g.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a mid brown colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.","fourFigureLat":"52.68728693","fourFigureLon":"-1.69076807","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"June 30, 2014","datefound2":"July 30, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harlaston","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-C937AF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"68.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
