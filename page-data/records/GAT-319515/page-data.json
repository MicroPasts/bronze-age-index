The blade is rounded and asymmetrical and narrows moderately to meet the shaft; it is fairly sharp with no signs of impact damage. The shaft sides are slightly convex and fairly parallel. There are slight flanges visible on both faces of the axe along the edges of the shaft running from the base of the blade and reaching almost to the butt. The butt is rounded and quite sharp. There is a slight stop-ridge visible on one face. The blade is lenticular through its length, and, aside from the flanges, fairly flat across its width.\n\n\n\nIt would appear that, except for the effects of corrosion, the axe is largely intact. The asymmetrical blade may be the result of major re-sharpening after damage in antiquity.","fourFigureLat":"53.18953941","fourFigureLon":"-4.15670502","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Roland Flook","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Roland Flook","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Gwynedd","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rflook/PAS2013_24_007_white 001.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Gwynedd Archaeological Trust","length":"90.37"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
