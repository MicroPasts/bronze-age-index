Much of the mouth is missing and the cutting edge is somewhat chipped. The axe seems to have had a square opening with a small ridged rim around the mouth. It had three raised midribs running down both faces and there are small casting lines along both the sides. One side has a small, broken knob indicating the original presence of a loop at that point. The axe is quite worn and much of the original surface is missing. The remaining areas have a smooth, dark, brownish patina. The other areas of the surface of the metal are rougher and have a green-brown colouring.\n\nLength 74.2mm, width (across cutting edge) 36.4mm, width (at break â€“ just where the attachment loop would have been) 26.9mm, depth (at break) 23.1mm, weight 89.4g","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anja Rohde","datefound1":"June 10, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anja Rohde","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walesby","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/arohde/E5667 axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"74.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
