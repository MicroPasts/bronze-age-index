The edge of  the fragment comprising the socket-end has a pronounced rim from which a small portion of the original mould line is visible. The fragment has a side loop that abuts the lower edge of the  moulded rim.  The fragment measures 29.8mm long, 20.9mm wide, 11.5mm thick with loop, 4.1mm thick without the loop and it weighs 11.78 grams.  The fragment is of an even dark green colour and patina, although pitted on both surfaces from corrosion. Due to its fragmented nature, a full identification of the type of socketed axehead is difficult.","fourFigureLat":"50.901624","fourFigureLon":"-0.13839","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Liz Walker","datefound1":"February 11, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Liz Walker","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"CLAYTON","county":"West Sussex","district":"Mid Sussex","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/saehoile/SUSS-5637C2 Bronze Age Socketed Axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"29.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
