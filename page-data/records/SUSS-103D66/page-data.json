The fragment consists of one-half of one of the double loop strands, which is lozenge-shaped in cross-section and terminates in the flattened sub-oval terminal hook, which would have fitted the arm band to the other looped element of the bracelet. The apex of the lozenge cross-section has been decorated with small incised lines, positioned slightly obliquely across the apex. The terminal end has been further decorated with two other raised ridges flanking the central apex mentioned above and one of these also bears the traces of small incised oblique lines, whereas the other ridge is too worn to discern this decoration. The entire fragment has an overall dark green patina and colour and the break across the centre of the arm band is flat and distinct, similar to the cuts in 'Sussex Loop' bracelets found in Middle Bronze Age hoards from Sussex (cf. Treasure case 2011 T192, the 'Near Lewes' Middle Bronze Age hoard). The fragment measures 86.47 mm long, 45.1 mm wide, 10.16 mm thick and weighs 69.28 grams.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: 'Sussex Loop' bracelets have been attributed this title because nearly all known examples originate from the Brighton-Lewes East Sussex area. Recently, a further two Sussex Loop bracelets were discovered in Surrey and given the Treasure number: 2013T316. These examples were the furthest discovery point away from the original examples and potentially the only non-Sussex examples known and were designated finds of significance for this reason. This example, having been discovered in West Sussex is another example of a non-Brighton-Lewes area bracelet and as such, begins to raise issues with this type of bracelet being designated as only coming from this locality. However, because of the reasonable radius of the new discoveries from the original ones, it is still possible that these could be items of local manufacture and circulation.","fourFigureLat":"50.88561713","fourFigureLon":"-0.26698347","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"\nThis fragment was subjected to XRF metallurgical analysis by Dr. Jaime Kaminski at the University of Brighton. Dr. Kaminski confirms that the alloy used here is similar in composition to others of this type and as such, should be stylistically and compositionally acceptable for identification as a 'Sussex Loop' fragment in spite of missing other diagnostic elements to old damage.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"February 04, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stephanie Smith","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upper Beeding","county":"West Sussex","district":"Horsham","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS103D66.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"86.47"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
