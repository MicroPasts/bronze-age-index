It represents part of the body and socket of the object and is crescentic in cross-section. The rim is raised and triangular in cross-section, it has incised herringbone decoration. The breaks are relatively worn likely indicating archaic damage. It has an even bright green patination.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 33.95mm long, 27.3mm wide, 12.13mm thick and 23.57g in weight.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This fragment is very limited in size and makes exact identification difficult. From the form of the fragment it seems likely that the object is a socket gauge of some description although this would make a very large example. In regards size it seems more in line with socketed axes but the only group with similar, albeit cast decoration are Axes with Rope Moulded Mouth type which are known from Scotland (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos. 1033-1037) with one known from Northern England LANCUM-D99FD1 so this link is tenuous.","fourFigureLat":"51.25907021","fourFigureLon":"0.86501887","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sheldwich","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTEAC37E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"33.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
