The fragment consists only of the curved blade tip; although little survives the curviture and thickness of the axe head does suggest that this was part of a flat axe, possibly a developed flat axe which would have narrowed behind the curved blade with hammer raised flanges lower doen the axehead. See SUSS-4D7454 for a complete example. The axehead is sub-triangular in plan with a thick crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid with tapering edges.","fourFigureLat":"51.46311088","fourFigureLon":"-1.33923878","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"August 01, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winterbourne","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2014475.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
