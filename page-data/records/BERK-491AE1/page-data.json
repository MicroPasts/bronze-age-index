The object is flat on both sides with three fairly straight edges and one edge with two small rounded 'bumps' and a larger rounded corner. There are two breaks on the long edge with a small semi-circular shape which suggests a piercing through the object. The shortest edge has no breaks along it but the opposite end is broken as is the top edge of the large rounded corner. There are no breaks along the side with the small rounded bumps.\n\n\n\nLength: 65.88mm, Width: 34.09mm (widest point), Thickness: 7mm, Weight: 65.30g","fourFigureLat":"51.41823615","fourFigureLon":"-1.3542664","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"42","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Smither","datefound1":"January 27, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Smither","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Speen","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK491AE1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"65.88"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
