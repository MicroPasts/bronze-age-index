The fragment is sub rectangular in plan, and triangular in section. The socket is sub-rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along one of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at one side, forming a sharp curve (or hook), the other side shows signs of damage. The blade shows signs of breakage and damage. The cutting edge is still visible on the front of the axehead. There are possible file marks, evidence of sharpening, present on the front of the axehead.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead fragment measures 39.8 mm in length, 40.9 mm wide (at the blade), 34.5 mm wide (at the body), 16.3 mm thick (at the body), 5.02 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 26.6 mm deep. It weighs 61.4 g.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with areas of brown colouring, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.\n\n\n\nAnother example of a Late Bronze Age Socketed Axehead fragment can be found on the database: WMID-EB5248.","fourFigureLat":"52.75957418","fourFigureLon":"-1.91253021","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"September 06, 2014","datefound2":"September 06, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mavesyn Ridware","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMID-6D041B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"39.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
