In profile it is broadly lentoid (pointed oval), with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid. The axe is broken toward the butt of the axe, but more than three-quarters of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge. It seems most probable that the axe was cast in an open mould. All the diagnostic elements of the axe are lost (such as shape of butt and hafting specifications). The condition of the axe is poor - the majority of the surface patina has been removed by laminating corrosion, which appears to be active. \n\n\n\nThe axe measures 77.6 mm in length, it is 34.4 mm wide at the butt and the blade is 75.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 8.7 mm, the blade is 2.8 mm thick. It weighs 253.6 g.\n\n\n\nThe object is a dark brown in colour with an uneven patina. Areas of green active corrosion are present on the surface of the object. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of much of the original surface detail. From the blade shape (which could be described as fan-like) it is probable that the axe falls into the Migdale tradition of metalworking. This fits with the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC. Axes such as this are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Other broadly similar axeheads have been recorded on the database, including HESH-33EA4A, LANCUM-E30276, NMGW-5F8955 and LVPL-DA4598.","fourFigureLat":"53.01035831","fourFigureLon":"-1.5245213","fromdate":"-2250","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn (Derby)","datefound1":"December 05, 2016","datefound2":"December 05, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn (Derby)","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shottle and Postern","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Amber Valley","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/helenglenn3/DENO1CEFD2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"77.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
