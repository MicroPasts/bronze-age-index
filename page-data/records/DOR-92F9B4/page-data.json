Three or four of the palstaves are of Breton type and two or three are of Norman type, with only one recognisable as a British type. The closest parallel for this find is the Marnhull hoard, Dorset, where 90 palstaves were recovered (25 of Breton type and the majority of the remainder of Norman type) (Lawson & Farwell 1991; cf. O'Connor 2009, 274-5). O'Connor suggests that these palstaves originated in Lower Normandy (Ibid., 274). Breton and Norman type palstaves were also found together at Hayling Beach, Hampshire in gravel (and therefore possibly redeposited from elsewhere; see Ibid. for details and references) and from Easton, Hampshire (Ibid.). It is likely that the Continental palstave types from the 'Portsmouth area' hoard were also imports and therefore form an important additional find.\n\n\n\nThe uncertain origins of this hoard make it difficult to establish how the objects were deposited. However, the unusually degraded condition and quality of the patina of the palstaves described above (Nos. 1-12), combined with their unusual typology (primarily imports of Breton and Normandy types from France) make it highly probable that they were deposited together as a single deposit.\n\n\n\nConclusion: As a find of two or more objects of copper alloy, this find qualifies a Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nLawson, A.J. & Farwell, D.E. 1991.
