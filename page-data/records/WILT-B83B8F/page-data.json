The blade also narrows in its width, disappearing into the point at its tip but there is damage to the blade on both sides near the tip and it is not clear what the original shape was. It is circular in profile. Near the tip the blade is 2.30mm thick and at the break it is 3.45mm thick.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the break, there is possibly a trace of the end of the socket, off-centre within the mid-rib and c 2mm in diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patina is grey-green in colour. The fragment measures 46.52mm in length, 15.38mm in width at its widest, midway along its length, but the blade is damaged here and this would not have been its original width at this point, 12.30mm in max.thickness at the break , and weighs 18.74g.","fourFigureLat":"51.28510506","fourFigureLon":"-2.08741725","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Hanbidge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Hanbidge","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Edington","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILTB83B8Fb.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"46.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
