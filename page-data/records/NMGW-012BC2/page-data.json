Although damaged the axe appears to have a lozengic long-profile. The original butt does not survive (but with a surviving width of 15mm). The better preserved side is unusually straight for its preserved length (of 43mm) and is bevelled towards its mid-axis.  There is the suggestion that the side may be beginning to curve outwards before the surface has been lost. The side of blade faces have a slight lip for the flange and corresponding hammer facets are discernible on the sides.  The original blade edge has been lost (with a surviving blade width of 35.8mm) and the original form is no longer evident. Both blade faces have a clear median bevel, which has a gentle curve and is positioned close to the damaged butt end (32mm from the butt where the axe has a maximum thickness of 12.0mm and a surviving width of 25.3mm), producing a lozengic long-profile. The blade faces have a gentle convexity across their both their widths and lengths, with no discernible blade facet. There are striations running along the blade near its end, suggesting only a slight loss to edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of powdery grey-green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe unknown scale of truncation to the axe, particularly the butt makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively high position of the median bevel would suggest that the butt end may be significantly eroded. If the current very narrow and straight-sided form of the axe, is representative or near-representative of its original shape, then the axe would perhaps suggest a Class 4 axe-chisel. The axe may possibly be of similar form to Developed Axes of Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 65-7)[1] and if correct may correlate to Needham’s Class 4E. The axe is likely to date to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, dated to c. 2050 – 1700BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
