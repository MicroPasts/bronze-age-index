A slight horizontal collar is present on a couple of faces. There is a single loop on one side of the axehead. The loop measures 18.1 mm in length, and 6.6 mm thick. The blade is wide and crescentic with some damage to the cutting edge. The casting seam is visible down both sides externally but is not visible within. Three domed protrusions are visible inside the socket. The mouth of the socket is square. Internally the socket measures 22.8 mm by 21.8 mm.  The socket tapers down to where the crescentic edge of the blade begins. It is 52.2 mm deep.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 65.4 mm in length. The cutting edge is 38.6 mm wide and 4.7 mm thick. The socket is 30.4 mm wide by 31.9 mm thick. The metal is 3.3 mm thick. The axehead weighs 116.3 grams.\n\n\n\nThis axehead has suffered little damage and is in very good condition with a dark green patina. There is a wide scar across one surface, it was probably struck by the plough whilst in the plough soil.\n\n\n\nSeveral similar socketed axeheads have been recorded on the PAS database. These include: LIN-C61E83; WREX-5806C1; BERK-2B2982; NMS-5A0D4E and WAW-9DBD6B.","fourFigureLat":"51.94957886","fourFigureLon":"-1.53581513","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"The 3D model has been generated using the mobile phone scanning application Qlone","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Over Norton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID5EA8F2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"65.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
