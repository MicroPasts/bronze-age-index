The ridge is circular in section. Most of the socket is missing. The arrowhead has a dark green patina. It is 21.2mm long 10.9mm wide and 6.2mm thick. It weighs 4.02gm.\n\n\n\nThere are few confirmed Bronze Age socketed arrowheads found in the UK; possible examples on the PAS database include SF9209, WMID-28FC66 and SWYOR-C57356. Like the example recorded here, it is possible that all of these pieces are small spearheads rather than arrowheads - see, for example, database record BH-E94CD1. The find is from an area where mostly Roman objects are recovered, but as copper alloy Roman arrowheads are even more rare than Bronze Age ones, a Bronze Age date is tentatively suggested.","fourFigureLat":"52.9845708","fourFigureLon":"-0.556584","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"January 29, 2013","datefound2":"January 28, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jack Coulthard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ancaster","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"South Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2299_arrowhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"21.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
