The tang has a surviving length of 15.6mm and is of rectangular section, which diverges towards the prominent collar (12 x 9mm at the collar). At the collar the chisel has a width of 19.9mm and a thickness of 12.2mm. The chisel blade thins and narrows below the collar, to a minimum width of 16.4mm. The sides of the blade are concave to produce an expanded blade edge with a surviving width of 35.0mm. The chisel has a pale green to brown patina with some surface survival and has active bronze corrosion. Deep surface striations on one face appear to be beneath the patina and may have occurred in antiquity.","fourFigureLat":"51.510049","fourFigureLon":"-3.442359","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-700","notes":"Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).\n\n\n\nTanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt 'C' sword.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanharry","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.119.2.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"53.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
