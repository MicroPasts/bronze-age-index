The upper is flat but with a large knop or swelling relating to the casting gate used in its production. The bottom is a rounded convex shape. The ingot is heavily pitted likely due to a mix of impurities in its matrix and the uneven natural material used to create the bowl in which it was cast.\n\n\n\nMeasurements:121mm in diameter, 41.49mm thick and 1,225g in weight\n\n\n\nDiscussion:The bowl furnaces were developed during the Mediterranean Bronze Age, becoming popular in Britain in the Late Bronze Age and were used intermittently to the modern era for many types of metal. It becomes much rarer in the production of copper-alloy after the Roman Period. Iron Age and Roman bun ingots tend to be much heavier than those of the bronze age often weighing upwards of 12kg, this example weighing only 1.25kg would be suggestive of a late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.19745492","fourFigureLon":"1.16182545","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"121","edge":null,"thickness":"41.49","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barham","county":"Kent","district":"Canterbury","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT14DDA6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
