The edges of the spear are worn and pitted, and there is some corrosion to the surfaces. The two faces of the spear head have differing patina; one side has a brown patina, while the other has a blue-green colouring. This is most likely due to conditions within the soil and probably because the spearhead has only recently been dislodged from its original context.","fourFigureLat":"51.65237486","fourFigureLon":"-1.42321913","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"October 22, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2016624.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"56.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
