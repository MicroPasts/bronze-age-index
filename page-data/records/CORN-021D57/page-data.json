The ribs are now worn almost flat and the surface is heavily pitted and corroded so that very little surface patina survives. The cutting edges of the fragment are also jagged and damaged. The fragment may date from the Middle Bronze Age, but to be sure of its date, it will need more metallurgical analysis.\n\nRohl and Needham (1998) illustrate some similar rapiers with broad mid-ribs on page 132, Fig.34, Nos.189-190, which are group IV rapiers, and date from the Penard phase of metalwork, c.1300-1150 BC.\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a flat-ribbed rapier from Crediton on page 662, Plate 101, No.219d, which dates from the Acton Park phase, c.1500-1400 BC; and a worn triple arris rapier on page 663, Plate 102, No.298a, which dates from the Taunton phase, c.1400-1300 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.127132","fourFigureLon":"-5.471223","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"July 04, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Marazion","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June08finds 004.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"56.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
