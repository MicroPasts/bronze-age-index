The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 43.0mm and 27.6mm respectively, a surviving socket depth of 60.9mm; a face thickness of 2mm – 3mm and a side thickness of 3mm – 5mm) and has a sub-rectangular section at the break, with a stub on one side, presumably from the loop. One face and part of the side have been hammered inwards, over the socket and suggests deliberate contemporary damage. The sides are near-straight parallel before diverging more sharply to an expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 55.0mm). The sides of the axe are bevelled towards their centre, where the raised casting seam is evident running along the centre. The casting seam has been neatly hammer-finished. The blade edge has a moderate and even curve. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, with the central rib slightly more pronounced. The faces are convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facets evident. One face has recent damage scars. The blade edge is preserved and has a contemporary impact indent near the centre and sharpening striations are discernible running along the blade edge. The surface has a mid to dark-brown patina with green corrosion in the recent damage scar. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form indicates a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form, scale and ribbed decoration suggest the axe to be of South Wales or allied type and of Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC). The inward hammered at the break would suggest deliberate damage prior to deposition.","fourFigureLat":"51.81206612","fourFigureLon":"-2.915255","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantilio Crossenny","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20162082.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"88.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
