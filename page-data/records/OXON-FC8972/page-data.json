Description: An incomplete strip of decorated gold, of probable Bronze Age dating (c. 2150 BC to c. 1150 BC). The strip is an oval/ellipse shaped band that tapers towards the possible terminals. The terminals have a corrugated appearance consisting of three or four peaks and troughs, each created length-ways for approximately one quarter of the object&#39;s length. The central section of the band is undecorated but, like the rest of the object, displays a number of scuffs and striations to both surfaces. There is evidence of a fold at either end of the corrugation and a third diagonal fold across the centre of the object. The finder reported that he unfolded the object himself, thinking at first that it was modern foil.\n\nDimensions: 53.3mm long, 13.3mm wide, 0.5mm thick, 3.5 grams.\n\nDiscussion: It is difficult to identify the object as a particular object type, although it may belong to a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments of Bronze Age date. A number of parallels have been recorded through the Portable Antiquities Scheme (Northfleet, Kent: Treasure Case 2004 T326, Brixton Deverill, Wiltshire: 2006 T250, Gussage-all-Saints, Dorset: 2013 T428, Roche, Corwall: 2014 T39 and Wantage, Oxon 2013 T674). As Dr S. Needham pointed out in the report for Brixton Deverill (2006 T250): &#39;a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings&#39;.\n\nConclusion: This fragment has a precious metal content of greater than 10% and is, on the balance of probabilities, of prehistoric date. It therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).","fourFigureLat":"50.76914904","fourFigureLon":"-2.89474598","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"","datefound1":"April 08, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whitchurch Canonicorum","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2018395.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"53.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
