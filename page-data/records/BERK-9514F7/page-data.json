The fragment comprises part of the grip, the shoulder and part of the blade. The final half of the blade and the end of the handle are broken and missing. The blade has a lozenge-shaped cross-section. There are two rivet holes, aligned parallel to the edge on the shoulder on each side (internal diameter: 5.34mm). On one side the rivet holes are complete, on the other side both are worn through. There are a further two rivet holes on the handle; they are aligned horizontally and both are worn through. These perforations have a waisted profile. The broken edges have the same mid green patina as the rest of the surface suggesting the damage occurred in antiquity. Similar hilt fragments were recorded in the Petters late Bronze Age metalwork assemblage (Needham 1990:52-53). Plate 4 (Needham 1990:52) shows two examples of Ewart Park swords with omega-shaped indentations similar to the 'worn through rivet holes' on this example. Dimensions: length:183.33mm; width: 44.45mm; thickness; 8.98mm; weight: 194.00g. Reference: Needham, S. 1990. The Petters Late Bronze Age Metalwork.
