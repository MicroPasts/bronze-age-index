The knife is of Thorndon type and is from the Ewart Park phase, Needham Period 7, and Burgess Metalworking Stage XII.\n\n\n\nThe upper part of the blade and the lower part of the socket survive. The break between the two pieces is more recent than the other breaks.\n\n\n\nThe double edged blade has a flattened mid rib section with wide (4-5mm) concave edge bevels. The blade is 21.8mm wide at the socket end and 17.6mm wide at the break. It tapers from 6mm thick to 5.1mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe junction between the socket and blade was straight. The socket is sub rectangular in section and has straight sides. It tapers in width from 23.7mm wide at the attachment end to 21.5mm at the narrowest point near the blade, and in thickness from 12.96mm at the attachment end to 7.8mm at the blade end, then flares widthways and thickens immedieately before the blade to 24.8mm by 7.85mm. There is a single circular peghole through both faces of the socket in the centre of the surviving piece. It has a diameter of 4.5 - 5mm. The walls of the socket are about 2mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe socket fragment is 42.68mm long, and the blade fragment is 36.6mm long. The knife has a well developed green patina.\n\n\n\nThe record for a similar knife, GLO-E7BF27, notes that \"Evens suggests that such tools were used for woodworking, perhaps for hollowing out (1881, 209). Evans, J, 1881, The Ancient Bronze Implements, Weapons and Ornaments of Great Britain and Ireland Longmans, [pages: 209-10 ]\"\n\n\n\nThe knife can also be compared to DUR-850CB6 and SUSS-218F52.","fourFigureLat":"53.62875337","fourFigureLon":"-1.18493388","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"August 31, 2013","datefound2":"September 29, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norton","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2125_BA_knife.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
