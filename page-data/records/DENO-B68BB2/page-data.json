The axehead is broken at the butt end with a ragged, but ancient, break. It has two longitudinal flanges which extend from the butt end beyond the curving stop ridge. Viewed from the side, these ridges are lozenge shaped. The attributes on the palstave are very worn. It is likely that there was a shield-shaped moulding below the stop ridge and a rib down the centre of the blade on both faces. The blade is narrow and without the usual prominent splayed tips of other early palstaves. The axehead is heavily worn and corroded, with a pitted grey-green patina. There are areas of a glossy olive green patina on either side of the stop ridge, on both faces of the axe. This palstave axehead belongs to the Taunton Phase of Bronze Age metalwork, dating circa 1400-1250 BC. It is similar to no. 809 in Schmidt and Burgess 1981, described as a low flanged palstave Type Wantage Variant Blackrock.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 119.2mm in length and is 38.3mm at the widest point of the blade. It is 21.1mm wide at the butt end. It is 18.7mm thick across the stop ridge and only 5.7mm thick at the thinnest part of the blade.","fourFigureLat":"52.35497432","fourFigureLon":"-1.85459865","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Natasha Harlow","datefound1":"March 20, 2019","datefound2":"March 20, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Natasha Harlow","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tanworth-in-Arden","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENOB68BB2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"119.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
