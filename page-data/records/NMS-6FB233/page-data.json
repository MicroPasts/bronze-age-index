One end is flat in cross-section, and gradually thickens to a circular cross-section of diameter 3mm about halfway down the object. It is slightly bent here, causing stress to the metal and loss of the surface. From here it tapers to a point. Where the surface is lost, the colour is a matt green; where the surface survives it is a polished dark brown. Length (as bent) 52mm, maximum width (at flat end) 5mm, maximum thickness 3mm, weight 3.17g.\n\n\n\nSimilar awls were made throughout the middle and late Bronze Age, but the dark brown patina suggests a middle Bronze Age date for this one.
