The remains of a circular rivet hole is present at the top of the fragment. The remnants of the original plan surface (concave, narrowing towards the edge) is located along the left hand side of the fragment.\n\n\nThe fragment measures 33.70 mm in length, 34.04 mm wide and 3.10 mm thick. It weighs 12.6 grams.\n\n\nThe fragment is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina.\n\n\nThe shape of the fragment, including the original bladed edge is suggestive that this fragment may have originally been part of a dagger or a rapier. However due to the size of the fragment, this identification is only a possibility.\n\n\nComment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): One edge has been broken to form a trapezoidal shape  as these things normally have two rivet holes both on the upper edge in the corners. I think from the pictures one is good for the original edge - the other is happenstance and where the second hole should be is lost - or deliberately cut down for an unknown reason - it looks deliberately thinned in section - it may have been cut down to form another object - possibly a razor.","fourFigureLat":"52.801635","fourFigureLon":"-2.832069","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"September 08, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Myddle and Broughton","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-A3EDA5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"33.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
