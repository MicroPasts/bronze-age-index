The object is flat and rectangular in plan. The upper end has suffered an old break and is very worn. The fragment is ovoid in section towards the break and expands slightly in width at the centre. From this expansion, the lower section is triangular in section and tapers to a point which is rounded in plan. The sides of the lower section are slightly thicker than the flattened central area, possibly indicating that the edges had raised sides which are now worn to almost the same thickness as the rest of the fragment. It has a dark green patina and a smoothed surface.\n\n\n\nTanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The attention to detail with the decorative facets around the head, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date. Bronze Age awls and narrow chisels are not common finds and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC, but maybe much later. Similar to SUR-435CC1 and ESS-159732.\n\n\n\nThe length is 80mm, the width is 9mm thickness 9mm and the weight 23.51g.","fourFigureLat":"53.7922584","fourFigureLon":"-2.50241327","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"March 03, 2016","datefound2":"March 03, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Salesbury","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM17104C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"80"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
