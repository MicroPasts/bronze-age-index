The axe is rectangular-sectioned (with a width and thickness at the break of 28mm x 10.0mm), with no suggestion of hammered flanges or developed edge features on the intact areas of the edges. The sides are straight and divergent before expanding more sharply to the blade tips, now damaged and truncated (with a surviving width of 69.1mm). The original blade edge has been lost (with a minimum thickness at the blade edge of 3.2mm) and the current edge is comparatively straight with a shallow profile, although the original edge was likely to have been deeper and with at least a moderate curve. The blade faces are flat across their widths and the blade becomes more convergent but there is no discernible facet and there is no median bevel evident. Hammering marks are evident on the blade and there is the suggestion of a blade facet (7mm deep from the current blade edge) with sharpening striations running along the blade facet. Large areas of the surface survive with a dark-green to brown patina, elsewhere the surface has a pale-green corrosion. \n\n\n\nMetallurgical analysis was conducted on the axehead using X-Ray Fluorescence and suggested that the metal composition is a leaded bronze. \n\n\n\nThe fragmentary and truncated condition of the axe makes detailed typological identification uncertain. The lack of any developed features but the bronze composition would suggest a Needham Class 3 axe and generally perhaps corresponds to the Migdale type as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981)[1] of Metalworking Assemblage III and dated to c. 2200 – 1900BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern England, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
