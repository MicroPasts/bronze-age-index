The ring consists of a single copper alloy bar, oval in cross-section which has been coiled to create the finger ring. It now has one complete loop and two incomplete loops. It appears to be complete, although both terminals exhibt traces of damage. The ring has a smooth dark green patina, with occasional pitting.\n\n\n\nThis example is similar to a number of coiled rings found in a Middle Bronze Age hoard found in Sussex, recorded under SUSS-C5D042. Similar rings have been found in the Mecklenburg area of North Germany suggesting close associations with the Continent. A brief period in the Middle Bronze Age is marked by the occurrence, in hoards, of tools and bronze ornaments which owe their inspiration to types current in north Germany and Scandinavia from c.1400 BC. These include torcs, coiled finger rings, ribbed bracelets, knobbed sickles, and square-mouthed socketed axes. This influx seems to have given a boost to the native bronze industry.\n\n\n\nOther similar objects recorded on the database include: WILT-6F5708; NCL-DA41F5; LANCUM-A4E905 & SWYOR-3FF370. \n\n\n\nIt measures 28.48mm in diameter (internal diameter 19.25mm), is 4.27mm thick, 14.94mm high and weighs 23.74g.","fourFigureLat":"51.28227423","fourFigureLon":"-2.81865291","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"14.94","diameter":"28.48","edge":null,"thickness":"4.27","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Axbridge","county":"Somerset","district":"Sedgemoor","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jshoemark3/SOM36B525.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
