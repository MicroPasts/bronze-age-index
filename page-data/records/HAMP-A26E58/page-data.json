The spearhead is 101mm in length, with a pointed leaf-shaped blade, 20mm wide across the rounded lower part of the wings, which comprises half of the extant length of the spearhead. This has a prominent rounded midrib which runs seamlessly from the socket to the blade tip. The socket is conical with a flanking pair of small rounded side loops around one third of the way up the length of the spearhead from the open socket. One of these loops is incomplete.","fourFigureLat":"51.10429763","fourFigureLon":"-1.51576098","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"Cf Davis’ (2012) Group 6 (Developed side-looped) type.\n\n\n\nRecorded from details emailed by the finder.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"May 04, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Houghton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMPA26E58.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"101"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
