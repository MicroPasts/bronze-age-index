The object is 72mm long and circular in cross-section. It tapers over its length from 11mm in diameter at the striking end to 6mm at the working end. The last 7mm is bevelled from opposite sides to form a chisel point. The upper striking end of the tool is slightly upset, presumably from hammering. According to the PAS website (https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/awl) awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably inserted into a handle made from organic materials. The surface condition and patination of this object is commensurate with an object of some age. However, given the lack of archaeological context, and dating difficulty, a Bronze Age date cannot be assured; therefore, the suggested date range has been widened somewhat.
