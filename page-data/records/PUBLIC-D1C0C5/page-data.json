The surviving side is near-straight and slightly divergent to the blade tip (producing a surviving blade width of 30.0mm). The side suggests that the axe was of slightly hexagonal section. The casting seam is evident and has been fettled, seemingly by hammering. The axe faces were gently concave across their widths but slightly convex across their lengths. At the break there is the slight suggestion of a rectangular base to a socket, possibly suggesting that the axe has broken across the socket base, although the identification is somewhat speculative. There is a notch in the blade edge which seemingly occurred in antiquity. The current surface is heavily-pitted with a mid-green patina.\n\n\nThe casting seam on the axe implies a casting technology using a two or three piece mould technology and therefore an axe of cast-flanged type at the earliest, and more likely a palstave or socketed axe fragment. The speculative identification of the socket base may indicate a Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,200 - 700BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.527709","fourFigureLon":"-2.217617","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"August 05, 2010","datefound2":"October 21, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grittleton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.234.5i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"25.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
