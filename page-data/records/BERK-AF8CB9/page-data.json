The rapier consists of the butt, shoulders and part of the blade. The butt is rounded above the shoulders with the securing notches now broken and incomplete. The blade narrows only slightly from the shoulders and is lozenge-shaped in cross section. The edges of the blade is bevelled from a wide flat plan that narrows down the length of the blade.\n\n\n\nThis rapier or dirk blade is similar to Trump's (1962) Group III rapiers, specifically no. 15, which is catagorised as the Lisburn class of blade. These Lisburn blades have been found in Ireland as well as Britain, with a large number coming from the Thames.","fourFigureLat":"51.70694101","fourFigureLon":"-1.56724498","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bampton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2015280.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"61.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
