Most of the blade tip and cutting edge remains and does not curve round at the edges.  One of the blade sides is intact until the break, but most of the blade side opposite has been broken at a slant down to near the blade tip.  The artefact is in a worn but fair condition with only small traces of the original patina surviving.  The surface of the axehead fragment is dark grey in colour.\n\nFlat axes appear in the Early Bronze Age (c. 2500-1400 BC) and then progress into the manufacture of palstave axes which mostly appear in the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2500-1400 BC), but still continue in use into the Later Bronze Age (c. 1400-700 BC).  It is difficult to determine which type of axe this blade fragment belongs to.","fourFigureLat":"51.319973","fourFigureLon":"-1.484795","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"January 01, 1999","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Linkenholt","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-2667D2  2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"26.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
