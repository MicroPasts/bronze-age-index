The metal is very thin and is evidently a bungled casting; edges and point sharp. Upper end of blade bent over, and cracked across one face about 1\" from the point; edges rather chipped and bent over, but very sharp; crack across one face where the blade joins the socket (on the opposite face from the crack) near the point; the socket is bent below this crack, in the opposite direction from the bend near the point, the whole spearhead being 'S' shaped in profile; loops are not broken, but are imperfect castings. Mouth of socket damaged, and of thin metal.","fourFigureLat":"51.6510248","fourFigureLon":"-1.5121633","fromdate":null,"todate":null,"notes":null,"materialTerm":null,"identifier":null,"datefound1":null,"datefound2":null,"subsequentActionTerm":null,"recorder":null,"gridSource":null,"quantity":"NA","height":null,"diameter":null,"edge":"","thickness":"","discoveryContext":"peat","parish":"Hatford","county":"Berkshire","district":"","regionName":null,"country":"England","patina":"Varigated brown patina","surface":"Smooth and in fairly good condition","other":"","composition":"","associations":"","publications":"","inputBy":"Joellen McGann","imageURL":"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/15003860870_83563afa50_b.jpg","flickrURL":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/MicroPasts/15003860870","project":"SpearHeadsA2","rightCorner":"F","collection":"H.
