Part of the loop, and part of the haft including the butt end are missing. A casting seam runs the full length of both sides. On both faces below the stop ridge there is a shield-shaped depression from below the top of which a median rib extends as far as the start of the cutting edge. The latter is unsharpened. This complete bluntness aa well as the rounded and smooth quality of the \"breaks\" indicate that this is a casting reject. The angle of the breaks suggests that the mould may have toppled over before the metal had cooled. Extant length 139mm. Width 63.5mm. Thickness 32mm.
