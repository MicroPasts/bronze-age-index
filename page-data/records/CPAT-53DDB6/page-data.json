It is possibly Bronze Age, as to function; it is possibly a casting sprue.  See find number WAW-48D8F4 for a parallel.  In support of the date, it was found near the location of five scattered BA palstaves.   One other possibility would be that of a gaming piece, perhaps Roman in date.","fourFigureLat":"52.309791","fourFigureLon":"-3.482888","fromdate":"1500","todate":"200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"October 28, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nantmel","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2974-0001.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"26.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
