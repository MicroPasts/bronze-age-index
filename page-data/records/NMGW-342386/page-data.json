The sides of the palstave are straight for their short lengths, either side of the breaks. The butt end is sub-rectangular sectioned at the break (17.8mm x 12.2mm), slightly concave across the width of the septum and has lost the flanges. One side has a prominent raised stub (giving a maximum surviving width of 26.4mm) from the remains of the loop. The stops are truncated slightly (with a height above the septum of 5 -6mm and a thickness of 24.0mm) and are straight and vertical. The top of the stops are bevelled to the blade, which is of sub-rectangular section at the break (20.9mm x 15.4mm), with convex faces, across their widths. There is the suggestion of ribs at the top of the blade faces but now lost to corrosion. Both breaks occurred in antiquity and the position of the breaks may suggest deliberate damage to the palstave. The surface is worn and corroded with a dark-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the palstave makes typological identification indeterminate but the slender form with a loop would suggest Low Flanged.
