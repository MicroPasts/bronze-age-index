The fragment is sub-rectangular in shape the butt and a fragment of the flanged sides survive. The axe has anangular butt and the sides gradually widen towards the break. Both sides of the palstave have high developed flanges, which increase gradually from the butt to from sub-triangular sides. The sides are unfinished, as you can still see the ridges from the casting process.\n\n\n\nThe faces of the axe fragment are slightly concave, creating a H-shaped cross-section. The faces of the axe show signs of wear, such as scratches and the break is even and patinated, suggesting that the object was broken in antiquity. Due to the fragmentary nature of the object, it is difficult to confidently assign a Type.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 27.12mm in length, 25.93mm wide, 12.78mm thick and weighs 19.78 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.19516483","fourFigureLon":"-1.88689397","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Fiona Johnstone","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Fiona Johnstone","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shrewton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cristinasanna/9963.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"27.12"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
