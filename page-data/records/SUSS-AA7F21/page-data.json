The fragment includes part of one wing and the edge of the central socket. The remaining wing suggests the spear was originally leaf shaped and the wings were bevelled both sides in a straight line from a prominent central ridge containing a hollow socket. The spearhead dates from the Late Bronze Age and possibly belongs to the Ewart Park phase (c.950-800 BC). It measures 44.7mm long by 14.5mm wide and the blade is 4.9mm thick at the socket, narrowing to 0.9mm at the edge. The remaining maximum thickness of the central ridge is 7.0mm. It weighs 10.58grams.","fourFigureLat":"50.917487","fourFigureLon":"-0.635692","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-801","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"January 27, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Liz Walker","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sutton","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lburnett/SUSS-AA7F21.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"44.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
