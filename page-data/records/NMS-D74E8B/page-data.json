Late Bronze Age copper-alloy socketed axehead,&nbsp;found 25th January 2018\n\nDescription: Incomplete socketed axehead. Sub-rectangular mouth with prominent lip, shallow D-sectioned loop, the rectangular-sectioned body flaring to form the curved cutting edge which exhibits some superficial damage but is otherwise intact. Shallow groove running along each long edge on both faces. Part of the mouth is missing, the breaks corroded and worn. The surface has a smooth dark green patina. There is a small fragment of copper alloy, possibly a fragment of the axehead, sitting inside the bottom of the socket and corroded in place.\n\nDimensions: Length: 102mm, extant width of mouth: 35.5mm, width of blade: 53.8mm, weight: 193.35g.\n\nDate: c. 900 to&nbsp;800 BC\n\nAddendum 1: Seven further fragments were found between 18th and 25th November&nbsp;2018.\n\nCatalogue:\n\n2. Fragment of copper-alloy socketed axehead, just the closed end with cutting edge surviving together with a small part of the rectangular-section socket, about 7mm .in length.&nbsp;Very abraded, with no original surface and a pale matt green patina. All breaks worn very smooth. Surviving length 29.2mm, maximum width 41.4mm, width at break 36.9mm, maximum thickness 12.7mm, weight 39.4g.\n\n3. Unidentified cast copper-alloy&nbsp;fragment, roughly flat and rectangular, broken at both short ends. The long edges are slightly concave, and are rounded in cross-section. Each face is flat, but one is slightly concave and the other slightly convex. The breaks are not fresh, but are not particularly worn. Surviving length 35mm, maximum width 30mm, thickness varies between c. 7 and c. 8.5mm; weight 40.3g.\n\n4. Fragment of copper-alloy metalworking waste. Long, rounded lump with several bubbles and folds. Black matt surface with areas of pale green corrosion. Roughtly 40 x 15 x 14mm,&nbsp;weight 23.6g.\n\n5. Rounded droplet of copper alloy with one side flat apart from a central hollow. 19 x 12 x 7.5mm,&nbsp;weight 5.93g.\n\n6. Long droplet of copper alloy with roughly rounded cross-section and rounded ends. 22.5mm long, 5mm diameter cross-section, weight 3.24g.\n\n7. Thick, flat sub-circular or sub-square copper-alloy droplet, rough on both faces. 13 x 14mm, 5mm thick, weight 3.21g.\n\n8. Rounded, flattish oval piece of lead waste. Smooth and slightly convex on one face, lumpy on the other. 22.5 x 15.5mm, maximum thickness 5.5mm, weight 4.62g.\n\nDate: The original batch of objects from this hoard was dated to the Late Bronze Age, 1000-700 BC, and the additions do not change the likely date.","fourFigureLat":"52.75433747","fourFigureLon":"1.45134513","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"The findspot and date of the objects strongly suggest that they&nbsp;represent&nbsp;additional elements of the scattered hoard previously reported as 2016T470 (NMS-6DAFAC).
