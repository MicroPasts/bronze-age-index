The fragment is a sub-triangular shape with two of the sides being old breaks. It comprises the thickened rim from the mouth of the socket with a raised transverse band around the exterior approximately 5mm inboard of this. Between the rim and the inset band there is a raised longitudinal casting seam. The unbroken edge of the fragment shows a slight curvature commensurate with it being from the mouth of a socket. The colour is a mid green faded to light green by erosion on the high spots. Circa 1000-700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.64821683","fourFigureLon":"1.05851771","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"February 14, 2016","datefound2":"February 14, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"East Tuddenham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/NMS39003A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Garry Crace","length":"19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
