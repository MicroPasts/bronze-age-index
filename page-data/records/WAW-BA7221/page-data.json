The blade of the axe is slightly flared to the blade tips, and the blade cutting edge is a deep symmetrical convex shape. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the flange facets. Body and haft end of the axe has almost straight sides which taper slightly at the butt, which is straight at the terminal. One face is possibly decorated at the junction of the body and blade, just within the facets, in the form on at least three short linear notches. However, there is a possibility this is damage from antiquity. The body of the axe has shallow (2.92mm deep) rounded flange facets, therefore in profile the facet sides are a pointed oval and taper down at the butt. The flange top/crests are in-turned therefore the width between the crests is narrower than the base. The surface has large patches of a green/brown coloured patina with areas of the surface missing, but not recently, and one patch of active corrosion. It is in a fair condition. The axe measures 147.36mm long, 53.71mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 24.06mm thick across the apex of the facets. It weighs 471.4g.\n\n\n\nBen Roberts (University of Durham) comments that the axe is a 'late flanged axe rather than a palstave which would date it to the latter part of the Early Bronze Age (c. 1700- 1500 BC)'. (pers comm). This type of axes are distributed across Britain, and few have been found in a datable context, therefore making it difficult to date them with accuracy (late flanged axe rather than a palstave which would date it to the latter part of the Early Bronze Age (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).","fourFigureLat":"52.1929072","fourFigureLon":"-2.27937017","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ben Roberts","datefound1":"January 01, 2013","datefound2":"April 08, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24.06","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rushwick","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Malvern Hills","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-BA7221.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"147.36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
