Probably Davis Groups 5-11. Only the very tip of the spearhead survives. It has straight sides at the tip, and the centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib.\n\n\n\nThe object has a smooth grey green patina damage to the blade edges. The broken end is less patinated than the rest of the object, but it is not an immediately recent break.\n\n\n\nIt is 26.4mm long, 9.4mm wide and 4.8mm thick. 2.6g.","fourFigureLat":"53.24753848","fourFigureLon":"-0.75757344","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"May 16, 2015","datefound2":"May 16, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Newton on Trent","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2675_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"26.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
