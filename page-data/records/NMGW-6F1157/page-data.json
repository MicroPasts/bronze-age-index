The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-oval in section with both ends terminating in old damage. The fragment is a small section of the blade with a convex/raised midrib (14mm wide, max 8.8mm thick) flanked by a pair of parallel longitudinal grooves on either side c.3mm from the long edge on both faces. The grooves do not appear to narrow on the fragment and the distance is the same between the lines at the upper and lower section of the fragment (14mm) although the long edges of the blade are damaged from corrosion so the cutting edge has been lost.\n\n\n\nThe tip of the object is rounded and pitted with bright green corrosion. The other end has a central concentric depression c.3.5mm in diameter in profile. One side of the blade has 3 small holes, likely corrosion products. \n\n\n\nThe fragment is small and lacking diagnostic features so it is difficult to ascribe a type with certainty. A similar sword fragment of Carp’s Tongue type with two longitudinal grooves is illustrated in Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015:99 pl. 26 no. 325) from West Knighton, Dorset. Burgess (1968:22 fig. 13) also illustrates a sword from the River Thames dating to the Carp’s Tongue complex of the Late Bronze Age. The fragment is likely from a Carp’s Tongue type sword of the Ewart Park phase of metalwork.\n\n\n\nThe object is a medium green patina with patches of bright green corrosion and measures 27.8mm long, 21.5mm wide, 8.8mm thick and weighs 16.05kg.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects are recorded on the PAS database e.g. CORN-56AC86, DOR-B4D511, BH-9CC7C7, BH-4C7707, ESS-3BF240\n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n\n\nKnight, M., Ormrod, T., and Pearce, S. 2015.
