The blade is slightly bent at either end but it is not clear whether this represents any deliberate treatment or simply post depositional damage.","fourFigureLat":"51.13736035","fourFigureLon":"-1.04373784","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"September 27, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bentworth","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMP9AE0D7a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"126.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
