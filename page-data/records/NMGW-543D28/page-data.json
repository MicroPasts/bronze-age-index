Part of the butt-end of the palstave is missing, whilst the loop has broken off in antiquity. This narrow palstave form exhibits waisting below the stop, the upper sides above the stop being very slightly convex. The sides below the stop are slightly concave and curve outwards into a moderately expanding, but narrow cutting edge. The cutting edge is now blunted, but moderately crescentic in plan. A prominent midrib or mid-ridge descends from the stop on each face, whilst the face edges are rounded. This gives the palstave a lozenge shaped cross-section immediately beneath the stop. The flanges of the palstave are heavily eroded near to the stop, therefore obscuring the characteristic side view of this axe form, which appears as an elongated lozenge. In side view, the stop curves outward gradually, rather than as an angular overhang. Most of the original surfaces of the palstave are lost, with local original surface patches above the stop on each side and on one upper face. The palstave is thus heavily eroded, with extensive pitting visible along the lower blade end. The palstave has a dark green to brown patination.","fourFigureLat":"51.79857","fourFigureLon":"-4.002651","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1000","notes":"Transitional palstaves may be dated to the Middle-Late Bronze Age, specifically the Penard-Wilburton metalworking phases (c.1300-1000 BC) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981).
