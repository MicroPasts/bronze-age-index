The butt (with a width of 24.6mm and a thickness of 4.8mm) is damaged and its original form uncertain. The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the position of the stop (where the axe has a width of 27.2mm and a thickness of 18.1mm). The sides of the blade have an even and gradual curve to the now damaged and eroded blade tips (with a maximum surviving blade width of 49.4mm). The sides are corroded and no transverse ribs, or ‘nicked-sides’ are evident.  The original blade edge has been lost but suggests a moderately deep curve (with a depth of 17mm). The flanges are truncated but appear to have low, beginning from beneath the butt and reaching their maximum heights (with a surviving height of 17.4mm and a maximum height above the septum of 5.5mm) above the stop. The septum is straight and flat across both its length and width and has a few small casting flaws. The stops are vertically sided and slightly concave (with a height of 5.5mm). Corrosion has removed much of the surface detail on the blade faces but there were depressions below the stops, suggestive of the shield-pattern. It is also possible to suggest a midrib, indicating a trident design. The blade faces have a gentle convexity across their widths and are straight but gradually convergent across their lengths, with no obvious blade facet surviving. The original surface has largely been lost with remnants of a dark-brown patina and elsewhere is pale brown with patches of pale green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe corroded surface has removed much of the diagnostic detail but the palstave appears to be of an early form, with a depression below the stop rather than a shield moulding. The suggestion of a subtle midrib may indicate similarities to ‘Early Midribbed palstaves’. Primary Shield Pattern and Early Midribbed palstaves are likely to both be of Acton Park metalworking, dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
