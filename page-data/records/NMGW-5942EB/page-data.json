The axe is likely to have had a lozengic long profile but the surface loss has eradicated any median bevel. The butt (with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 1.7mm) is straight and angled to one side. The sides are straight and near-parallel, gently divergent, before diverging more sharply at the blade (52mm from the butt, where the axe body has a width of 25.5mm). The blade is now asymmetric, differentially worn or corroded on one side. The blade edge is moderately expanded, producing a curved blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 38.2mm). The flanges appear to have begun just below the butt and probably reached their maximum heights around the midpoint of the axe (with a surviving maximum depth of 11.3mm and a height of 2.1mm), which was likely to have corresponded with the median bevel. The sides are convex across their thicknesses and there is the suggestion of a central ridge. The flanges are likely to have been hammered, rather than cast. The faces are now gently convex across their lengths, with no surviving evidence for a median bevel or for blade facets. The blades also have a gentle convexity across their widths. The surface survives near the blade edge with a dark-brown green patina. Sharpening striations running along the blade are discernible on one face. Elsewhere the surface has been lost and has corroded bright-green. \n\n\n\nThe loss of surface detail makes typological identification difficult. The low flanges indicate a developed form and the straight butt and straight, near-parallel sides, only more divergent at the blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 65-8)[2], furthermore, its comparatively small size would seemingly indicate the variant Swinton. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140\n\n\n\n[2] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
