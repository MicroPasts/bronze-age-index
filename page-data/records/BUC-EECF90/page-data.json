The object has two parts, with the first part a single cast chisel with a flat bladed terminal that tapers down to a point which is now worn and square. The other side is circular in cross section. There is no decoration on the object and it has an dark green patina. Small chisels and tools of this type were used for an extensive period of time, not simply in the Bronze age, but also in later periods for jewellery making and fine work. As such dating the object is difficult. The awl measures 59.3mm in length, 4.5mm in thickness, and weighs 5.39g.","fourFigureLat":"51.81933103","fourFigureLon":"-0.88428912","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"December 19, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fleet Marston","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUCEECF90.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"59.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
