Only one of the side loops survive, and is comparatively shallow. Approximately half of the socket is missing, probably because of erosion. The base of the socket is also missing, but is unlikely to have been very much lower. Only small areas of the original surface survive and the blade edge has also been eroded. The socket retains the remnants of the wooden shaft, and further shaft fragments were displaced when the spear dried subsequent to recovery.","fourFigureLat":"51.594488","fourFigureLon":"-3.834842","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1450","notes":"The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and elsewhere, and is similar to Savory (1980) Nos 227-230. This spearhead has been classified by Davis (2012, 56, No.142) within his 4A (Plain Kite Blade, Long) sub-class. Davis (2012, 55-56) lists 21 examples of this sub-class (incl. the present example), though the Sandfields example is one of only two examples that has side loops close to the base of the socket; the other is from Craigielee, Perth (Davis 2012, No.138). Group 4, as a whole, lacks homogeneity in terms of overall form, and the distribution in Britain is typically more northern, with five findspots known from Scotland (Davis 2012, 58). The type may have some Irish influence (ibid.). The Sandfields spearhead is the only securely provenanced Group 4 spearhead from Wales, though examples are also known from Cheshire and Herefordshire (Davis 2012, Nos.136, 145). Davis (2012, 56) has dated this group to the Acton Park phase in the early stages of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1600-1450 BC).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"November 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sandfields West","county":"Neath Port Talbot","district":"Neath Port Talbot","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn1130.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"101.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
