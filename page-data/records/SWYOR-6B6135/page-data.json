The axehead is sub triangular in plan with a wide curved blade which tapers to a curved butt and is rectangular in section. The axehead is undecorated and there are no signs of ridges or flanges indicating that this is an early flat axe, probably in the Migdale tradition of narrow butted flat axes. The metal is pitted, corroded and worn, with a green patina with a lustrous surface surviving in places. The cutting edge and the butt are damaged, but there are no fresh breaks. The axehead is 118.9mm long, 66.6mm wide, 10mm thick and weighs 258g. Illustrated examples of flat axes may also be found in Nicholson's Prehistoric Metalwork, pages 79-83.","fourFigureLat":"53.952969","fourFigureLon":"-1.285295","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mary Blevins","datefound1":"September 22, 2011","datefound2":"September 29, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mary Blevins","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bilton-in-Ainsty with Bickerton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mblevins/PAS_1658_Axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"118.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
