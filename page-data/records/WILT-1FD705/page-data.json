It is probably a Ewart Park type sword.\nThe surviving fragment is 61.2mm long, 23.6mm wide at the (oldish) break and weighs 18.00g. It is max. 3.2mm thick at the broken end. It is slightly bent in profile at the tip. The edges are jagged but worn and there are signs of repeated working on the midrib. Much of the original patina has been lost and the metal is dark/ black in colour and rough to touch with areas of greeny blue corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.114163","fourFigureLon":"-2.172809","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-701","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Deverill","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Bancroftsword.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"61.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
