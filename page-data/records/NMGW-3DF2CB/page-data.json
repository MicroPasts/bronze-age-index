The socket was circular, with a small fragment of the simple rim surviving (with a maximum surviving internal diameter of 14.0mm and an external diameter of 16.7mm). The socket continues to the break across the blade. The sides of the socket are near-straight and gradually convergent. One of the loops is complete and is flat-topped of linear form (20mm long by 3mm wide), which begin 20mm from the socket mouth. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval (4.0-5mm long and 2mm high). Both sides have a ridge, running between the mouth and the base of the loop. Between the top of the loop and the base of the blade are five to six short horizontal incised lines, perhaps referencing or accommodating the binding. Only a small part of the blade survives (with a surviving length of 18.6mm and maximum surviving width of 45.6mm) but the gentle curve may suggest a leaf-shaped blade. The damaged blade edge with a blade facet is evident and survives on one side. Above the loop, the socket becomes increasingly oval-sectioned and defines a prominent midrib along the blade, as far as the break (with a thickness at the break of 9.5mm). The break occurred in antiquity and the socket (4.9mm diameter) is off-centre at the break (with a minimum thickness of 0.4mm). The spearhead has been neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is partially-preserved with a dark brown patina. Sharpening striations are evident beneath the patina running along the blade on the better preserved face. \n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. A side-looped spearhead of Davis’ (2012) Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London[4], and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31)[5] to 1680 – 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 – 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (Davis 2012, ibid. p 7). Most Group 6 spearheads however are likely to date from Acton Park and Taunton industries. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Davis, R., 2012; The Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads of Britain, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung V.
