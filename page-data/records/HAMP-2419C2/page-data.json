The body is oval in cross-section. The ring is undecorated, but the outer surface&nbsp;has&nbsp;feint scratches. One face has a small indentation near the left terminal (gap at the bottom) and scratches across the width of the ring. The other face has scratches&nbsp;across the length of the ring (ie the scratches are at a 90 degree&nbsp;angle on the two faces). The terminal surfaces&nbsp;are both flat, but each has a small &#39;U&#39; shaped mark&nbsp;(the bottom of the U towards the centre of the ring), which are possibly&nbsp;cut marks from the removal of the &#39;missing&#39; piece, or casting marks.&nbsp;\n\nGap between terminals: 2.01mm.\n\nLength: 15.34mm.
