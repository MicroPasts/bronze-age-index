The wheel is circular in plan with a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate before joining the outer rim. The rim of the wheel and the spokes are rectangular in cross section. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle which appears to have been drilled. The upper surface of the model is covered with striations in one direction which appear to have been creating by an abrasive surface. The reverse of the modle is not decorated.\n\n\n\nThe model is 21.8mm in diameter, 1.9mm thick and weighs 2.50 grams.\n\n\n\nOn the record for HESH-C53CF4, which is very similar to this example, Peter Reavill writes:\n\n\n\n\"This form of artefact is relatively rare and the PAS has only recorded one other example from Thimbleby, Lincolnshire (DENO-0BBA52). Images of this artefact were sent to Dr Adam Gwilt at NGMW, Cardiff. Dr Gwilt suggested that similar comparable artefacts had been recorded in the late Bronze Age / Early Iron Age assemblage from the votive site at Flag Fen, Peterborough, amongst the Iron Age Salisbury hoard, and also the Hounslow Hoard. \"","fourFigureLat":"51.25643186","fourFigureLon":"0.59251983","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jennifer Jackson","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jennifer Jackson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"21.8","edge":null,"thickness":"1.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hollingbourne","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jjackson/KENT-9348EE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
