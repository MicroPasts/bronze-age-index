It is rectangular, very nearly square in cross-section throughout, and it is not obvious which end is the blade and which is the tang. It is fairly sharp at one end and blunter at the other; the blunt end may be a worn break. The thickest and widest point is just over a third of the distance from the blunt to the sharp end. From here it tapers in both dimensions and directions but not symmetrically: two adjacent faces remain fairly flat from tip to tip while the other two taper to meet their opposites at the tips.\n\n\n\nCopper-alloy awls are generally thought of as Late Bronze Age in date, 1000 to 800 BC. They are often circular or round in cross-section at the blade. WILT-BC913A and SUR-BBF938 are other examples that have a square or sub-rectangular cross-section for most of their length.\n\n\n\nLength: 66.7mm. Width 4.3. Thickness: 4.3mm.
