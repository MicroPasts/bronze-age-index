On the back of each of the discs are two lugs, both perforated for an attachment pin. These are linked by two, small ribs. Disc A: Diameter 22.6mm, 2.9mm thick, Mass 4.79g. Disc B: Diameter 20.6mm, Thickness 2.9mm, Mass 4.36g. These object are difficult to date but may be related to the 'double looped' buttons that occur in the Bronze Age although the holes through the loops appear, at 2.0mm to be unusually small. A wide date range must be proposed.","fourFigureLat":"52.07630606","fourFigureLon":"-1.88468593","fromdate":"-800","todate":"400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kevin Leahy","datefound1":"September 21, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kevin Leahy","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"22.6","edge":null,"thickness":"2.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Badsey","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kaleahy/Birm629.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
