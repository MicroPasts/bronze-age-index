One side of the chisel has broken away to reveal the socket within, which is 36 mm long and 12 mm wide, but the upper mouth of the socket is missing. The chisel is corroded and pitted but there appears to be no active bronze disease. The blade has a curved edge which is worn, and fragments of the edge have been broken off in the past, but it appears to mainly follow the original edge with no flaring of the tips. There are small scars on both faces that are probably the result of plough damage. The hollow interior is cone-shaped, with the socket ending 20 mm up from the blade. The cross-section of the chisel is sub-rectangular with the walls ranging from 2 to 3 mm in thickness. The chisel is missing its butt end and was probably about 70-80 mm in length originally. The shape and curve of the blade suggest that this might have been a tool for carving wood, with the rounded edge enabling the carver to work with a concave area. The angle of the bevel, at about 20Â°, would have made it ideal for fine work where thin slivers of wood were being removed. \n\n\n\nNeedham & Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar example on page 132, no.175, which is dated to the Penard phase of the late Middle Bronze Age, c.1300-1150 BC.\n\n\n\nNeedham, Parham & Frieman (2013) illustrate similar socketed chisels from Langdon Bay in Kent on pages 70-71, fig.3.11, nos.121, 125 &127, but they are all incomplete, like this example, without mouth mouldings and side loops and therefore difficult to date within the Taunton / Penard phases.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar chisel from Buckland Newton in Dorset on page 103, pl.30, no.210 (see DOR-EE8574).","fourFigureLat":"50.11475892","fourFigureLon":"-5.58225589","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"March 26, 2016","datefound2":"March 26, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"12","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Madron","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Sep16finds034.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
