The axehead has a narrow round-ended butt, which widens into a sub-triangular axehead in plan, with dual-facetted flanges. The blade-end is wide and convex, but not crescentic with pointed ends, like other types from the same period. The blade-end has a pointed oval cross-section, whereas the body of the blade is facetted, creating an elongated hexagonal cross-section; the butt is sub-rectangular in cross-section. The axehead has an overall dark green patina. No regular decoration is visible. Parallels for the form can be found in Schmidt & Burgess's Developed Flat Axe series (1981, 59-68).\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 63.7 mm long, 11 mm wide (at butt-end), 28.7 mm wide (at blade-end), 3.7 mm thick (at butt-end), 5.3 mm thick (at blade-end), 6.7 mm thick (at centre); weight: 38.3 grams","fourFigureLat":"50.80391392","fourFigureLon":"0.29770421","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1500","notes":"Reference: Schmidt, P., and Burgess, C. 1981.
