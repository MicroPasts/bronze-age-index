The rapier is of the notched-butt type having a butt that is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade. Two rivet holes through the butt show how the blade was secured into a wooden or bone handle; one of the notches still retains its copper alloy rivet which is cylindrical with an   expanded domed head at either terminal. The blade is mostly straight and only tapers towards the point. A prominant midrib can be seen down the length of the blade, which has been bent in antiquity. This rapier fits within Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV Type, see WILT-AD8D05 for a similar example and further discussion. A very similar rapier was discovered a few miles to the north of this example and is recorded on this database as GLO-036A39.","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"April 22, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017299.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"144.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
