The axehead has broken across the base of the socket, which has a length of 21.8mm and a width of 4.4mm. The axehead has a width of 33.9mm and a thickness of 10.55mm at the break. The sides are rounded across their width, and are divergent towards the blade tips (with a surviving blade width of 42.10mm), producing a moderately expanded blade. The blade edge is eroded and is gently curved. Both faces are plain for the surviving fragment. The surface has a pale to mid green patina. Socketed axes date from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, in the Wilburton metalworking industry, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 6 (c.1,150 - 950 BC), however most axes recovered tend to date to the Ewart Park Metalworking Industry (Needham's ibid. Period 7), c. 950 - 750BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.439977","fourFigureLon":"-3.28188","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.55","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wenvoe","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006181.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
