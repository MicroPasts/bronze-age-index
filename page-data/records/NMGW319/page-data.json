The surface of the fragment is corroded and its edges are damaged. The break is ancient. Surviving length 71.5mm, maximum surviving width 17mm, maximum surviving thickness 2.5mm. The fragment is an example of Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV (1981, 3, 62-112). It is not possible to identify which particular type of Group IV blade this fragment is an example of because the diagnostic features high up on the blade and butt have been lost.","fourFigureLat":"51.60137197","fourFigureLon":"-3.96507973","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"An example of a group IV blade - that is one with a flattish mid-section and wide bevelled edges cf. Burgess and Gerloff 1981,2. This group mainly consistent with the Penard Phase (Burgess and Gerloff 1981,3). Group IV blades were generally used, and deposited, during the Taunton and Penard phases of the Middle Bronze Age (Burgess and Gerloff 1981, 106-109) which date from between 1400 and 1150 cal. BC (Needham 1996, 133-134, fig.1; Needham et al. 1997, 84-90). Other Middle Bronze Age finds recorded from Swansea Bay include: a Group IV rapier tip with reworked butt [NMGWPA:99.81.1]; a probable Group III dirk reused from a longer blade [Acc.No.98.15H]; a Group II dirk with a mid-rib [Acc.No.98.15H]; and a leaf-bladed sword related to the Ballintober series (Green 1985, 283-285, pl.1).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip MacDonald","datefound1":"May 10, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Castle","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"71.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
