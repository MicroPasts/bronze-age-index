The object comprises a penannular ring formed by bending a strip of copper alloy round on itself until the ends meet. The band is D shaped in cross section. There is no visible exterior decoration and the surface is green an pitted. The object has been made by bending the strip but not around a former as the interior is not a uniform shape.
