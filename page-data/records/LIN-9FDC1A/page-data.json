The blade is made of copper alloy and now has a red-brown patina covering much of the surface, including areas of the breaks. The fragment is sub-triangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in section but both of the 'edges' are worn and irregular. The fragment appears to taper quite rapidly, suggesting that this could be from towards the tip-end of the weapon. The break across the wider-end is straight and appears to have been carefully cut rather than having been snapped or broken. The shorter-end above is irregular.\n\n\n\nLength: 16.21mm, width and thickness at one end 18.40mm and 4.02mm respectively; at the other end 13mm and 3.02mm respectively.Weight 4.06g.","fourFigureLat":"53.25099258","fourFigureLon":"-0.30780794","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"January 28, 2015","datefound2":"January 28, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Apley","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN9FDC1A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"16.21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
