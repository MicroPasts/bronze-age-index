The sides of the terminal are straight and near-parallel as far as a stop (17mm from the terminal where it has a width and thickness of 15.0mm and 9.0mm respectively. Above the stop the sides are straight but more divergent to the break (with a width and thickness of 18.8mm and 7.0mm respectively). The septum is longer on one face (with a surviving length of 20mm and 24mm, a thickness at the break of 1.8mm and a maximum width of 12.5mm) and the side flanges end in a rounded stop. The stop is comparatively shallow on both faces (at 1.5mm). The surface is heavily-corroded with a dark-green patina preserved on the septum. \n\n\n\nThe object has the flange and stop features in common with palstave axe types, generally of Middle Bronze Age date. It is possible that the terminal is incomplete and originally ended with a blade, perhaps suggesting a chisel or similar. If the end is relatively intact, it may be possible to suggest a small hammer that may have been hafted in a similar form to Middle Bronze Age palstaves and therefore earlier than socketed hammers. However flanged hammers of this form are difficult to parallel.","fourFigureLat":"51.96454255","fourFigureLon":"-2.9620237","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Longtown","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017232new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"47.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
