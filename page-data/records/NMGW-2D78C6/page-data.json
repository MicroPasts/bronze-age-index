The tang has a surviving length of 15mm and is eroded, but is likely to originally have been of rectangular section with straight sides. The chisel has a maximum thickness at the top of the blade of 5.3mm. No lugs or collar are discernible between the blade and tang. The blade has straight sides diverging towards the blade edge, areas of surviving surface on the sides of the tang and blade demonstrate that the blade diverges sharply from the tang. The blade has a surviving width of 19.3mm with a curved blade edge. The chisel has patches of original surface surviving with a mid-brown patina; elsewhere the chisel has a pale green surface.","fourFigureLat":"51.41253","fourFigureLon":"-3.32425","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"Tanged chisels have been found associated with palstaves (eg. at Priory Farm Cave, Pembrokeshire and at Doncaster, Yorkshire ) dating to the end of the Middle Bronze Age; these forms tend to have a longer blade with straight sides. Short bladed chisels with sharply divergent sides tend to have been found associated with Late Bronze Age metalwork and are often associated with Ewart Park metalworking, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7, dating to c. 950-750BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wenvoe","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.120.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"37.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
