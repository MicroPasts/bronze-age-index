The surviving fragment consists of the tip of the blade (which is slightly flanged), and part of the socket. The cutting edge of the axe is quite sharp and shows little sign of wear, suggesting that it was not in use for very long before it was broken. Although ritually broken axeheads and other Bronze Age objects are known, it is not possible to ascertain whether this example has been deliberately broken or not.","fourFigureLat":"51.392616","fourFigureLon":"-1.685195","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"April 03, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.42","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Savernake","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/LovegroveAxetip.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"24.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
