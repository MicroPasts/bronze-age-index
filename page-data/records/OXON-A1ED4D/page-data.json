The central or midrib part of the sword is circular with the blade extending out on each side; also on each side there are two deeply spaced lines, which would have extended the full length of the sword.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is a medium green colour and its edges are both chipped and worn.\n\n\n\nThe blade is 33.8mm long, 36.2mm wide, 8.2mm thick and weighs 30.21 grams.\n\n\n\nOwing to the size of the fragment it in unclear what type of blade this object was attributed to and how long the original item would have been. However, as Domscheit (2014) discusses, 'Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered'.","fourFigureLat":"51.850739","fourFigureLon":"-1.55135005","fromdate":"1150","todate":"800","notes":"Oxfordshire PAS Rally Record Sheet No: Y345","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"September 13, 2019","datefound2":"September 13, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Michael Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.21","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cornbury and Wychwood","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/maritime/Y345.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":"33.77"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
