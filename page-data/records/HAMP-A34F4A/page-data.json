It is most similar to a primary shield type and the form is similar on both faces of the axehead. The rounded butt is incomplete with one side more rounded the other indicating an area of loss. It widens to form the septum (23mm at widest point). The flanges are high (c.10mm) and rise steeply from part away (approx. 8.5mm) along the septum before terminating at a prominent stop ridge (19.6mm wide, 21mm thick). From the abrupt slope stop the blade narrows slightly (18.5mm) before broadening outwards to the blade tip (32.9mm), and then turns downwards and curves to form the blade which has a rounded cutting edge. The sides of the flanges are plain and without evidence for side loops. The whole surface is corroded and much of the original surface is missing, but it is possible to see the remains of a shield beneath the stop ridge. The top of one flange is torn with a portion pushed inwards and a small area of loss, most likely caused by plough damage.\n\n\n\nThis is a rare item with only one other comparable find recorded in the PAS database (WMID-EFD2EE). Both examples have clear stop ridges, visible cutting edges, and no evidence for side loops. Other miniature palstaves recorded with the PAS are of different form or material including BERK-602025, HAMP-0FD867 (copper alloy side loop) and SUR-1C249A (lead side loop). This latter is recorded as an Iron Age or Roman item, which accords with the likely date of the many miniature socketed axeheads recorded with the PAS. For an extensive discussion and typology of these miniature socketed axeheads please see Bliss 2020. For this find, the precision of the form and the condition of the metal suggests it is of Bronze Age date rather than a later imitation, which accords with the tentative dating of WMID-EFD2EE. These miniature palstaves merit further research to identify their likely date and use.  \n\n\n\nLength: 95.6mm\n\n\n\nLength (haft): 40.7mm\n\n\n\nWidth (blade, widest point) 32.8mm\n\n\n\nWidth (at stop ridge): 19.6mm\n\n\n\nThickness (at stop ridge): 21.3mm\n\n\n\nHeight of stop ridge (c.7mm)","fourFigureLat":"51.12317548","fourFigureLon":"-2.15855356","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jenny Durrant","datefound1":"November 13, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jenny Durrant","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brixton Deverill","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jdurrant/HAMPA34F4A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"95.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
