Other examples on the database include SWYOR-3A2CF7, NMS-B061B6, NMS-F982A3, WMID-CE6A76, NARC-F9B223, NMS-477E93 and SF6680. This appears to be the fourth recorded example from Wiltshire.\n\n\n\nIn contrast there is only example known from a secure British Bronze Age archaeological context (the Penard hoard, Archaeologica 71, page 138). At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import on the basis of a range of previous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France. PAS recorded finds have since demonstrated that these bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age, the Penard find was dated to 1275-1140 BC, suggesting at least a Middle Bronze Age date for copper alloy examples such as this one.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"August 31, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ogbourne St. George","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURD9AFD8a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"37.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
