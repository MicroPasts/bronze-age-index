The midrib is circular in section (approximately 8mm in diameter at the break) and extends into the blade to the tip. The surviving blade wing is very worn and abraded and widens from 5.5mm at the base to 9.0 mm before tapering to towards the tip.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the object makes typological identification uncertain so a wide date range of Middle to Late Bronze Age is suggested. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: length: 78.41mm; width: 17.98mm: thickness: 11.65mm and weight: 20.9g.","fourFigureLat":"50.80218701","fourFigureLon":"-0.78096455","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Timothy Locke","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Timothy Locke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.65","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hunston","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSSADB62Ea.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"78.41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
