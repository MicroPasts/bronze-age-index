The torc has a cruciform (x-shaped) cross-section with four flanges, although they twist in such a way as to give a circular cross-section around the flanges. The breaks are quite sharp, suggesting they could be quite recent. The bend is not quite at the centre of the object.\n\nThe ends, both slightly squashed, measure 8.2x6.2mm and 8.4x7.3mm. At these breaks the flanges are c.0.6-0.8mm thick, with a thickened rim (slightly flattened to the outside surface) 0.9-1.0mm thick. At the deepest, the depth between the flanges is c.2.5mm deep. The width/ diameter of the object is relatively parallel and c.9mm.\n\nThe fragment measures 41.6mm in bent length (unbent it would be c.75mm), 26.8mm in max width and 8.9mm in max.thickness. It weighs 18.24g.","fourFigureLat":"50.94952508","fourFigureLon":"-1.17571747","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1100","notes":"Its cross-section is very similar to another (terminal) fragment, 2015 T983, found in a neighbouring parish.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"April 06, 2019","datefound2":"April 06, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Declared Treasure but returned to Finder as Museum unable to acquire","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"8.9","edge":null,"thickness":"8.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Swanmore","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPDBAD3A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"41.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
