Length 220mm and 32mm wide across the widest part of the leaf-shaped blade. The socket, encircled by three lightly engraved lines, is 50mm and 16-17mm in diameter at the mouth where it is approximately circular in cross section; further up, the section is sharply angular. Because part of the wooden shaft remains firmly wedged in place it is not possible to known how far the hollow socket extends. There are two neatly formed loops at the base of the blade, one a little larger and lower than the other. The two halves of the mould have been very slightly misaligned and the thickness of the socket metal varies around its circuit. There is a small blow hole in one side of the spine just above the loops. The weapon is not worn or smoothed by the sea and there are stains on the blade which suggest that it had laid until recently in some peaty soil. It is probable, therefore, that it had been recently eroded from coastal peats.\n\n\n\nThe metal is in good condition with a fairly uniform matt surface of blue/purple colour; nowhere is the patination shiny, which may be an effect of salt water and sand. The edges of the blade have been sharpened in the middle section in antiquity, creating a slightly ragged, thinner edge; the bottom of the socket has also seen a little damage which may have occurred during use. This spearhead falls within Davis' (2012) Type 8A spearhead (flame-shaped blade, incorporated basal-loops) and can be dated broadly to the Taunton phase (1400-1275 BC) (Davis 2012,133-134). It is recorded in Davis' (2012) corpus: No.741, Pl.45. The spearhead can be paralleled in the Taunton hoard itself and in the Stibbard hoard from Norfolk. In Wales the closest parallel is the very splendid weapon from Nebo near Llanrwst which is twice the length but has the same angular socket and essentially leaf-shaped blade (Bezant Lowe 1912, 47; Ellis Davies 1929, 342). A spearhead from the river at Hay on Wye is of similar date but has a rather more complex section across the blade (Savory 1980, 112, fig.27).","fourFigureLat":"52.732976","fourFigureLon":"-4.045221","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1275","notes":"The coastal area of Merioneth on either side of the Maddach has produced quite a number of chance finds of bronze implement over the years (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 109-28). The palstave is the main working tool of the period and there are several of both Middle and Late Bronze Age date; but in addition there are a surprising number of weapons. A spear, now lost, from Barmouth had loops on the socket, so probably belonged to an earlier phase than the Tal y Bont one; those from Llanfrathen and Brithir are without loops and belong to the Late Bronze Age. The famous Cwm Moch hoard contains spears with basal loops but a rather more triangular blade which indicates a date in the Penard phase, about 1200 cal BC. This hoard also contains rapiers, the quintessential Middle Bronze Age weapon, soon to be replaced by the leaf-shaped sword which first appears in this phase. Rapiers are rather rare everywhere, but Merioneth has produced another from the Cwm Moch area. Two fine gold torcs (twisted 'neck rings' but long enough to be used as a belt) have been found, one near Harlech and the other on the slopes of Cadair Idris. At a slightly later date a splendid bronze shield was buried in a bog near Gwern Einion and a rare bronze bucket was similarly offered to the gods at Arthog (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 126-7). Coastal Merioneth may therefore be regarded as a region of wealth and splendour in the Bronze Age. The quantity of material is not especially large, but the quality and interest of the pieces is high.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"F Lynch","datefound1":"April 20, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barmouth","county":"Gwynedd","district":"Gwynedd","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"220"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
