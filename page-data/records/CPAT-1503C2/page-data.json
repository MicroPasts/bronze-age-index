The blade has a shallow but discernible midrib section, clear 'shoulders' and two rivet holes to the butt end.\n\n\n\nGiven the parallel edges, the simple rivet form and the possible length if this blade, I would err on the side of this being a dirk. The patina is now a very dark black/green due in part perhaps, to some restorative action.","fourFigureLat":"53.115202","fourFigureLon":"-2.972578","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1140","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"January 09, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rossett","county":"Wrexham","district":"Wrexham","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2827-0025.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"105"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
