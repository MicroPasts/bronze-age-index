The axehead measures 141mm in length. The object tapers from the wider blade end towards the butt; in section it is roughly lozenge shaped. The cutting edge has a crescentic form in plan and is lenticular in section; it measures 58.5mm in width from one end of the blade to the other. The flanges start a short way in from the butt corners, and terminate just beyond the central point where the septum meets the blade end. There is no stop ridge visible. There are slight traces of a raised central moulding running lengthways along the axehead; there are no other traces of decoration visible.","fourFigureLat":"51.10335947","fourFigureLon":"-4.15814659","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Danielle Wootton","datefound1":"April 11, 2012","datefound2":"March 31, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Danielle Wootton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Heanton Punchardon","county":"Devon","district":"North Devon","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwootton/DEV-07F6B5 Bronze Age palstave axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"141"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
