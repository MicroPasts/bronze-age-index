Looking at the blade - it seems more axe like and it has wear from being used and sharpened - one blade tip is lower than the other - the casting seams on the edges have also been hammered flat and finished - suggesting that this was an object that had a life prior to being broken. Patina&nbsp;would suggest damage prior to deposition. The&nbsp;orange on the metalwork suggests that the environment could well be seasonally wet - or it is from pasture that has a developed iron pan.","fourFigureLat":"52.10189599","fourFigureLon":"-1.41744108","fromdate":"1500","todate":"1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"January 01, 2022","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Smither","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shotteswell","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK2925DD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"52.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
