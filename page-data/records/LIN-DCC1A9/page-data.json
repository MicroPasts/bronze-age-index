Approximatly one-third of the axe remains, with the surviving third being the blade-end. The blade is flared, and one bale tip survives. The blade narrows to a rectangular hollow shaft. The section of the shaft shares the same mid-brown patina as the exterior, suggesting that it was dismantled in antiquity. The section is smooth in most areas, and appears to have been cut rather than being broken. Small patches of copper corrosion are visible around the section, and at one of the blade tips.","fourFigureLat":"53.3101281","fourFigureLon":"-0.72573878","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"\nIdentification done from photograph sent by finder.
