The blade is lentoid in section tapering to a point at each side. Both ends are broken and the damage is not recent. There is too little remaining of the sword to suggest a more specific date. Another similarly conditioned and shaped blade fragment on the database (SWYOR-ADCF83) is dated to the late Bronze Age. On this basis, a possible late bronze age date can be suggested for this. The surface is slightly pitted and has a light brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"53.827326","fourFigureLon":"-1.31782","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Ward","datefound1":"October 22, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aberford","county":"Leeds","district":"Leeds","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 929 BA sword blade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"27.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
