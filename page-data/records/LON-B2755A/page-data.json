Possibly associated with a late Bronze Age 'founders hoard'. The remaining ingot represents about a quarter of the total ingot. The ingot is an amorphous piece of set molten copper-alloy with irregular thickness. The ingot retains its bronze colour due to its depositional environment.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 45.15mm; width: 40.03mm; thickness: 20.8mm; weight: 135.85g\n\n\n\nSimilar bun ingots on the database are SF-C98115 and ESS-939345.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates four incomplete plano-convex ingots from Mountbatten, Plymouth, on page 597, Plate 36, No.281t, which were found associated with Late Bronze Age socketed axes, gouges, chisels and knives, and two from Churston Ferrers in Devon on page 601, Plate 40, Nos.306a-b.\n\n\n\nReferences: Pearce S.M., 1983.
