The fragment has a soft lozenge shaped cross section with very rounded edges. The tip is also very rounded. The object has a thick green patina with some black staining. Similarly on the break is a slightly browner corrosion product although wether this is indicative of an Iron core is difficult to determine. Regardless the patina is chipped and worn.\n\n\n\nThe object is 48.3mm long, 39.0mm wide, 8.2mm thick and weighs 33.52 grams.\n\n\n\nThe triangular shape and lozenge profile are similar to that seen on Wilburton and Ewart park Swords dating to the Late Bronze Age. It may also be the tip of a leaf shaped pegged spearhead as the central rib on these is weaker in the later periods.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"August 31, 2019","datefound2":"February 01, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON95898A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"48.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
