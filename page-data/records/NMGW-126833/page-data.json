The casting jet is corroded, but displays the remnants of the characteristic four runners used to produce the South Wales Type axe during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age. The upper face of the jet is flat, while the lower face is irregular and concave, with the remnants of the four projections. The jet is of irregular oval shape and does not have a central aperture, it is of a light - mid brown colour with very little of the original surface surviving.","fourFigureLat":"51.650247","fourFigureLon":"-2.911991","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"The casting jet was found associated with a ribbed socketed axe blade fragment (NMGWPA 2003.144.1; NMGW-B88605) and is similar in condition and colour to the axe fragment. The four-runner casting technology of the jet may lend further weight to the suggestion that the axe fragment is from a South Wales Type axe. The association of contemporary artefacts suggest the metalwork forms a small hoard deposited during the Late Bronze Age and is therefore likely to constitute Treasure under the revision of the Treasure Act 1996. Four-runner casting jets have recently been identified and recorded in a number of hoard discoveries in South Wales, including the St Nicholas, Cowbridge, and Brigam Farm metalwork hoards. Further recorded examples now in the National Museums & Galleries of Wales Collections have been recovered from St Mellons, Cardiff and the Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais Hoard.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"July 31, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llangybi","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1598.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"40.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
