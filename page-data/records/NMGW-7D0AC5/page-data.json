The hilt has broken across a rivet hole or the base of a slot, which has an hourglass perforation (of 2.9mm to 6mm diameter). The handle area has straight parallel sides for the short section surviving (with a width of 22.9mm and a thickness of 7.2mm). The divergent shoulders are straight and narrow towards the ricasso (to produce a shoulder width of 55.5mm). The ricasso is comparatively sharply curved and was likely to have been short, although the blade edge is not present on the fragment. The handle area and shoulders have slight flanges (with a thickness around the handle of 6.9mm and 3.7mm at the end of the shoulders). The shoulders have rivet slots (18 and 20mm long and 4.5mm wide). The top of the blade is of lenticular section (with a width of 36.0mm and a maximum thickness of 8.6mm). The top of the blade appears to have been broken by bending, which would have involved considerable force. The break at the hilt does not appear to have involved bending. The sword has a dark green to brown surface patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1120","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.42.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"54.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
