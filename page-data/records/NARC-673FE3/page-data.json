The spearhead has a leaf shaped blade and the loops on the socket which are a characteristic feature of native British spearheads. These loops are located 20.5 mm from the beginning of the blade, distinguishing the spearhead from late Bronze Age examples which tend to have the loops incorporated into the base of the blade. The spearhead is in relatively poor condition, missing its tip and the end of the socket, along with wear to the edges of the blade and the socket itself. It was found in two pieces by the finder who has reattached them. The diameter of the socket at its (broken) opening is 14 mm. The artefact measures 98.1 mm in length. The blade tapers from 22.3 mm to 8.3 mm at its point. \n This weapon dates from circa 1500 to 1200 BC. Similar examples are illustrated in Cheetham (1977, 47; 33-34).","fourFigureLat":"52.170832","fourFigureLon":"-0.977876","fromdate":"1500","todate":"1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gayton","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-673FE3spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"98.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
