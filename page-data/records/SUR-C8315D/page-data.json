These were found very close together, in three discrete locations across a linear distance of 1.6m, with findspots 50cm and 110cm apart respectively.\n\nThe objects comprise:\n\n\n\n\n\n1)    An incomplete socketed axehead with a single side loop. The tip is missing from what appears to be an ancient break. The socket is irregular in shape, somewhere between sub-rectangular and sub trapezoidal with a thick moulded rim. The cross section of the blade is rectangular at the break; the sides are parallel, suggesting that the cutting edge was relatively narrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nLength: 101mm; width: 48mm; thickness: 32.7mm; weight: 240.82g.\n\n\n\n\n\n2)    A fragment of the butt end of a palstave axehead. The corroded remnants of flanges are present on both sides, suggesting it was a long-flanged type; the cross section is H shaped with flat faces between the flanged sides.\n\n\n\n\n\nLength: 40.6mm; width: 26.6mm; thickness: 13.6mm; weight: 46.42g.\n\n\n\n\n\n3)    Two fragments of plano-convex copper alloy “bun” ingots: 56.6mm by 46.5mm by 24.8mm, 292.18g; 54.6mm by 55.4mm by 21.2mm, 226.11g. Both are square in plan, with one curved and one flat face and a wedge-shaped side profile.","fourFigureLat":"51.22997929","fourFigureLon":"-0.45460018","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"These objects are all heavily corroded as a result of deposition in acidic greensand soils. The socketed axehead is a typically later Bronze Age type (c 1150 - 600 BC), whilst the flanged palstave is more typical of the middle Bronze Age (c 1500-1100 BC), but is also a common type of inclusion in later mixed assemblages. The bun ingots, with characteristically plano convex surfaces suggesting an origin in a bowl furnace, are also typically a product of the later Bronze Age and are often found in hoards with axeheads such as these and other implements. Due to the degraded nature of the break edges it impossible to say whether these ingot fragments belong to one or multiple ingots.  \n\nThe very close proximity of the findspots and overlapping date ranges of the finds strongly suggests that they were originally deposited as a coherent group. The composition of the assemblage is suggestive of a metalworker’s hoard, with the mixture of socketed axehead and copper ingots seen here being most common in the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"June 06, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"4","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shere","county":"Surrey","district":"Guildford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURC8315D_palstave2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
