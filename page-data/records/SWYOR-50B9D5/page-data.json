The fragment consists of only the very tip of the spearhead - it has a narrow and slender tip with a pronounced midrib. The midrib is rounded in section and is flanked by tapering wings that join at the tip. There are pronounced edge bevels which are 3-4mm from the edge of the spear. The tip is slightly damaged and abraded. One of the wings has broken at the wider end but has been glued back together. The edges of the spear head are worn and chipped. The break at the wider end is patinated. The mid rib is hollow. Since only the tip of the spear head has survived it is not possible to identify an exact form or class of spear head. However, there are perhaps similarities to Triangular spear heads from the Penard Phase (1300 - 1140 BC) in the middle Bronze Age. Please compare to PAS record IDs: SWYOR-8E7758 and YORYM-6DB701. Should such an identification from the fragment be correct, the most likely classification would be of a 'projecting basal looped' spearhead, Davis Group 9. Davis (2017) notes that 'these were current in the Taunton and Penard phases', about 1400 - 1125 BC. \n\n\n\nLength: 117mm; Width: 37mm; Thickness: 15.1mm; Weight: 55.1g","fourFigureLat":"53.582934","fourFigureLon":"-1.064974","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mary Blevins","datefound1":"February 01, 2011","datefound2":"March 30, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mary Blevins","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stainforth","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mblevins/PAS_1462_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"117"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
