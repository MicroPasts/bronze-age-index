The spear is dated from the Penard Phase - Ewart Park so c1200-750BC (Needham period 6-7). Ehremburg notes that there is a sub-classification that she calls 'short stumpy' types (p15) which have a length of less than 100mm with the width of the blade being approximately 1/3 the length. This example fits this although it could be slightly longer - she suggests that these are from the Ewart Park (1000-750 BC Needham Period 7) assemblage. This example is similar to her #36 Cookham Berks and # 94 Pusey Berks, #74 Maidenhead, Berks and #142 Old Windsor, Berks, all fig 22.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is in fine condition with blades still sharp and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. It may have formed a deliberate deposit in a river valley.","fourFigureLat":"51.42540377","fourFigureLon":"-1.08088868","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-750","notes":"The spear was found about 2000.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"December 31, 2000","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"23.16","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Theale","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCN3542.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"106.88"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
