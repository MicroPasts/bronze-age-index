The mouth of the axe-head has a prominent collar and indicates a rectangular shape with rounded edges, however only half the mouth remains, in addition to the single loop. To the side of the loop runs a longitudinal ridge with a darker green fill; this appears to be a casting fault, and a possible attempt at fixing the break: though this appears to be an old mend, it has not been established whether or not this feature is the result of recent intervention. With the exception of the collar, the edges of the highly fragmentary axehead are worn and all demonstrate an even, green patina, suggesting the breaks are old. Worn ridges on the surface of the front of the axehead suggest there may originally have been one or several ribs running from the collar towards the (now missing) blade. \n\n\n\nWeight: 25.05g, total object length: 39.96mm, width of extant mouth: 39.95mm, thickness of collar: 3.21mm.","fourFigureLat":"53.0917609","fourFigureLon":"-1.67294665","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Maria Kneafsey","datefound1":"October 20, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Maria Kneafsey","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.21","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brassington","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Derbyshire Dales","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meghank/DENOAF3087.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"39.36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
