Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There is a large rectangular rim and recess on one face which could potentially represent a socket that has been melted into the ingot, perhaps from a socketed knife. There are also two rivets that have not melted into the ingot and have cavities around them, and two cavities in the form of blades on the other side of the ingot, perhaps from the ends of chisels. The XRF data below in the notes field indicates this ingot is largely copper, which would add some doubt to the possibility of this ingot having been melted from other objects (Matt Knight pers comm). But perhaps these objects have separated away from the ingot and retained their shape because the copper alloy weapons and tools would melt at a higher temperature than the pure copper ingot and must have been added to the metal for the original ingot (Martin Page pers comm).There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, plate 36, no.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar plano-convex ingot from Marldon in Devon on page 79, pl.6, no.146a (see DEV-677584).
