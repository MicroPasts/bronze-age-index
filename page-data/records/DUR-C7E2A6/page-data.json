There is a prominent longitudinal mid-rib on both sides and abraded cutting edges. Approximately one third of the blade has been broken off. A deep sub-circular socket of 6.04mm diameter is present. Much of the original surface has corroded and is lost; however, that which survives has a mid-brown patina. the remiainder of the object has a mottled green-grey patina.\n\n\n\nThe head measures 5.9mm in length and 15.96mm wide at its widest point. The blade is 10.07mm thick at the rib and weighs 15.5g.\n\n\n\nIt is most likely that the object is a spearhead as described above, the spear having being broken at the base resulting in the loss of the side loops. As such the record for similar spearhead LANCUM-7609C0 states that: \"Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.\"\n\n\n\nWhilst rare, there exists the possibility that the object could be an arrowhead. Information on the database states that \"Socketed arrowheads, whilst originally noted as being absent from UK finds have appeared across England, with the majority being found in the Midlands, with an example each from North Yorkshire and Shropshire. These artefacts are often found heavily corroded and thus can easily be mistaken for a small spearhead.\" Examples can be found at SWYOR-19E2B1 and WMID-3AE711.","fourFigureLat":"54.22283895","fourFigureLon":"-1.32665685","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ann Lipscombe","datefound1":"March 19, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ann Lipscombe","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"6.04","edge":null,"thickness":"10.07","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thirsk","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/benwestwood/DURC7E2A6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"45.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
