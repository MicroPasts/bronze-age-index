In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentic cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It is proceed by a double raised collar. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have not been worked down and remain fairly prominent, particularly towards the collar end. The blade edge has some wear but remains in good conditions. The side loop remains on one side. The axehead has a dark greenish well formed patina with some slightly lighter mottling in places, but is fairly restricted although may be areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length of 73.84mm, with a width (at widest including loop) 42.65mm wide, thickness 34.16mm and a weight: 131.34g","fourFigureLat":"51.91767139","fourFigureLon":"0.3686823","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"November 18, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"34.16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lindsell","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT5E6C9F.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"73.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
