The fragment is the blade end of the axehead which is trapezoidal with a worn cutting edge and rounded corners. The cross-section is rectangular and the breaks are old and worn. The tip of an off-center socket can be seen to the broken end.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark brown patina and is worn. The fragment is 35.2mm long, 46.5mm wide, 15.7mm thick and weighs 72g.\n\n\n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.94923153","fourFigureLon":"-0.81300274","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Yapham","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/PS0861.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"35.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
