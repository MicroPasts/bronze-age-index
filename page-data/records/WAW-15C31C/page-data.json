It is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section with a raised central mid-rib on both sides. The fragment has a rounded point at the top, which has sustained some damage. The sides of the spear head taper from the rounded point to a broken end. It has a mid-green surface patina which has been heavily abraded; the spear head has lost most of its diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult.\n\n\n\nIt measures 44.16mm in length, 11.86mm wide (base), 6.86mm wide (tip) and 7.81mm thick. It weighs 12.28grams.\n\n\n\nSimilar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including one from Newark and Sherwood, Nottinghamshire (DENO-447EC6) and East Hampshire (HAMP-A3D039).","fourFigureLat":"52.18417656","fourFigureLon":"-1.86978155","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Emily Freeman","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Emily Freeman","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.81","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wixford","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/efreemondo/WAW15C31C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"44.16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
