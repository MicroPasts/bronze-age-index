Thin and prominent outsplayed mouth moulding, with loop extending from underside of moulding.  Three slightly divergent longitudinal ribs extend down faces of axe.  External and internal mouth shape ovoid.  Evidence for four runners on mouth top:  three projecting and one scar.  Base of socket is evenly shaped.  Axe has ovoid shaped body with curved side edges.  Sides of axe are slightly divergent but straight, with slight splaying and recurving of blade edges.  Casting flashes down each side have been roughly trimmed.  One face is slightly dented with cracks in the wall visible down one side of one rib and secondly across the face but merging with the first.  Half of the blade edge is missing through damage.  Striations parallel to the blade edge  on the blade bevel, together with a curved blade edge profile indicate that it was sharpened before deposition.  Traces of possible black patination are visible adjacent to the loop and below the mouth moulding.  Patina largely green with green carbonate encrustations.","fourFigureLat":"51.47427047","fourFigureLon":"-3.42683086","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"54","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"71.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
