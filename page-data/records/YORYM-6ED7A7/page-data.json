The object consists of the tip of the spearhead which has a pronounced central spine and a partial broken socket. The object also has partially retained wings which are missing large aspects and those retained are heavily abraded. An insufficient portion of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.\n\n\n\nThe metal is a dark green with a heavily pitted and corroded patina.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples can be seen on the Portable Antiquities Database: Unique ID: GLO-F2F1FF, Unique ID: NARC-B41416, Unique ID: NLM-A82A87 and Unique ID: SUR-219BC8","fourFigureLat":"53.9444105","fourFigureLon":"-1.36161773","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kirk Deighton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ellie/YORYM-6ED7A7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"67.78"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
