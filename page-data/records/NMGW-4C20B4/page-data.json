The fragment has a maximum surviving width and thickness at the break of 17.0mm and 9.1mm respectively. The spearhead has a prominent rounded midrib (6.9mm wide and 1.9mm high at the break) which narrows towards the tip. The better preserved side has blade facets with a width of 2.5mm. Deep striations along the blade facets may be the result of sharpening. The blade facets are curved suggesting the spearhead would have had a rounded leaf-shaped blade. The spearhead fragment has generally good surface preservation with a dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Woolaston","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Forest of Dean","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.80.1.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"44.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
