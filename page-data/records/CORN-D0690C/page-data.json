This fragment cannot be part of an axe blade or a razor blade as they taper towards the curved cutting edge and not towards the broken inner edge. It may look very like an axe blade fragment in plan, but the profile shows that it is not. But the cutting edge is missing so that any identification cannot be proven.\n\n\n\nSee NMS-0B76C3 for a similar sickle blade fragment, which is dated from the Late Bronze Age, and has worn as this piece has to create a skin-like patina layer, with lighter green corroded edges.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates two sickles from the Taunton hoard with a similar curvature in plan and taper in profile on page 651, pl.90, nos.752u-v, which are dated from the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age, c.1400-1250 BC.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate similar sickle blades on a tanged sickle and a socketed sickle from Somerset on page 103, pl.30, nos.376 & 452.\n\n\n\nGenerally tanged or riveted sickles and socketed sickles are now dated from the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC, but as this is a fragment, we cannot identify the type or even the object, so the metalwork phase cannot be determined.","fourFigureLat":"50.13399783","fourFigureLon":"-5.54170377","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Mitchell","datefound1":"June 06, 2016","datefound2":"June 06, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Mitchell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Madron","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/July16finds007.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"31.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
