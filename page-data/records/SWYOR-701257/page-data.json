The fragment is rectangular in section, has a curved end (cutting edge?) and is triangular in profile. It may be the very tip of a Bronze Age axe, but the sides of the blade do not flare as much as is usual. Not enough survives to suggest whether it was from a flat axe, palstave or socketed axe, but if it was from a tool of this sort, it was from one with an unusually narrow blade. The surface of the metal is corroded and pitted with a thick bluish green patina. There are no recent breaks. The possible axe fragment is 23.8mm long, 35mm wide and 9.4mm thick. It weighs 30.79g. The parallel most similar in cutting edge shape is a flat axe, number 174 in the Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in Merseyside County Museums by Nicholson. The parallel is unprovenanced and is a little wider then this example.","fourFigureLat":"53.980277","fourFigureLon":"-1.345821","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"September 09, 2008","datefound2":"September 09, 2008","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hunsingore","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 939 axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
