The fragment has a lenticular cross section and is sub-trapezoidal in plan, starting at initially at 12.02mm wide at the bottom, expanding to 13.75mm wide before then tapering to 6.53mm at the top. A flattened midrib runs along the object. The blade is bent around half way along the length from the bottom before being bent back, forming a slight arch. The blade has lost much of its cutting edge due to abrasion in the soil. The blade has a Verdigris patina and pitting on the surface.","fourFigureLat":"52.03125408","fourFigureLon":"-2.19090297","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Malcolm Adams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.47","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ripple","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Malvern Hills","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/madams/WAW23205A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"100.53"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
