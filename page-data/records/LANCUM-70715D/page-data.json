The objects imitates a Late Bronze Age socketed axehead of the Ewart Park phase (c. 1000 - 800 BC), in miniature (see for instance, SOM-7B35AD). It has a collared, square socket with a D-shaped loop to one side, and a wide, curved blade. The blade edge is worn and fragmentary and there are some worn patches to the surface of the object. Otherwise, the object has a smooth, brown patina. It is 55.15mm in length, 26.18mm in width and 14.60mm in thickness. It weighs 19.99g.\n\n\n\nMiniature socketed axeheads that imitate functional Bronze Age type axeheads are known from contexts ranging in date from the Bronze Age to the early Roman period. Examples include: WILT-33B468 and YORYM-9A3076. These objects are believed to have had a votive function. Many of the Roman examples are highly derivative and simplified in form, however, and the detailed form of this example indicates a date within the Late Bronze Age or early Iron Age.","fourFigureLat":"54.73106037","fourFigureLon":"-3.19724679","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss.
