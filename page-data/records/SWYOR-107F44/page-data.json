It is probably a Group II blade of Taplow Type.\n\n\n\nThe blade has a trapezoidal hilt with the surviving shoulder rounded and containing a single rivet hole. The other shoulder is missing, with an old patinated break across its rivet hole. The top edge is slightly concave between the shoulders, but this is probably owing to damage. The blade narrows from the shoulders to the break, the edges being slightly concave. The blade is elliptical in cross-section, with a slightly thicker centre, but no central rib or any decoration on the blade. The tip of the blade is missing, with an old break running across it at a slight diagonal. It is not possible to estimate the original length of the rapier or dirk. The blade has a mottled green and brown patina on both sides. It is 93.2mm long, 41.4mm wide and 2.4mm thick. It weighs 35.68g.\n\n\n\nTaplow Type dirks (less than 30cm long) and rapiers often have four rivet holes (unlike this example), and rounded shoulders as this one does. Some have very flat blades, like this one, and many of the blades are plain (Burgess and Gerloff, Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain cited by Dr Dot Boughton, pers comm 28th March 2019). Though there is a concentration of Taplow type rapiers and dirks in the Thames area and in Cambridgeshire, they are known from across England.","fourFigureLat":"53.99092424","fourFigureLon":"-2.16925987","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Chris Scriven","datefound1":"October 07, 2018","datefound2":"January 08, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Scriven","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coniston Cold","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/SWYOR107F44Rapier.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"93.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
