The surviving fragment comprises of the upper portion of the blade, truncated below the stop ridge at the butt end and with the cutting edge also lost. Both breaks are worn and patinated. The fragment is sub-trapezoidal in plan, slightly flaring towards the cutting edge, and sub-triangular in cross section, measuring 21.5mm wide by 15.5mm thick at the butt end, and 37.3mm wide by 7.4mm thick at the cutting edge-end. The fragment is 47.3mm in length. There is the suggestion of a mid-rib on one face of the blade, but this is tentative due to abrasion.\n\n\n\nOverall dimensions: length 47.3mm; width 37.3mm; thickness 15.5mm; weight 105.4g.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is too incomplete to be assigned to a typological group, and a broad middle Bronze Age date is suggested.","fourFigureLat":"50.74434247","fourFigureLon":"-3.54626209","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Leah Moradi","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Leah Moradi","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Duryard","county":"Devon","district":"Exeter","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEV7C73DE.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"47.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
