The ring measures 20.95mm in diameter (internal diameter 9.9mm), is 5.75mm thick and weighs 9.13 grams. It is circular in shape with a defined circumferential ridge running around the centre and flattened faces above and below. The interior surface also features a defined circumferential ridge, creating a hexagonal cross section. The interior surface exhibits scratch or wear marks which appear to have occured during use. The ring has a pitted dark brown patina with patches of green.\n\n\n\nSimilar rings have been discovered in a number of Bronze Age hoards and have been suggested as horse harness fittings, as being part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron of Class A1 (Type Tul-na-cross) and Class B1 (Types Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg) (Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g)., or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire.\n\n\n\nCf.
