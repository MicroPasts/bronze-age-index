Part of the rimmed collar for the socket remains. Just after the rim there is a side loop to help secure the axe to its handle. There is substantial casting line running from the rim and along the mid-line of the loop onto the body of the axe. It appears this casting feature has had very limited finishing. The fragment is dark green on the surfaces and a light green on the breaks which may suggest the axe was broken while in the ground but a substantial time after its deposition.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 39.97mm long, 27.64mm wide 5.16mm thick and 21.20g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"51.34561735","fourFigureLon":"0.62627357","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Thompson","datefound1":"April 01, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Thompson","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hartlip","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ynwhsh7/socketaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"39.97"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
