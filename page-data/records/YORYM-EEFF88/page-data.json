The object is roughly rectangular in plan, broader at its mid-point. The two ends of the object are very different: one end is sub-round in cross-section tapering to a point, the other is rectangular in cross-section and tapers to a flattened and rounded terminal. These two ends converge at the broader middle.\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence here of mid-point projections, ridges or flanges is the case on chisels dating to the Middle Bronze Age (see HESH-51B7E2, YORYM-71EBF0 and WAW-EF4C84). This example better fits into the Late Bronze Age Awl category, usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976, p.48). They may have been used to make holes in leather and wood. Awl parallels have been recorded as SF-ECC48E, NMS-5DE706, and NMS-1EF240.\n\n\n\nThe object has a covering light green patina. It is 87.45mm in length, 8.50mm wide at is mid-point, and weighs 14.67g.","fourFigureLat":"54.07003762","fourFigureLon":"-0.3816562","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Kerrie Hoffman","datefound1":"August 31, 2014","datefound2":"August 31, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Kerrie Hoffman","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kilham","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khoffman/BL1307.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"87.45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
