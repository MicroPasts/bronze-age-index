The fragment is lozenge shaped in section, with the blade and midrib surviving. The tang or shaft would have been helpful in identifying it to a certain date, but this part is missing. However, as the midrib extends to the tip of the blade, which is of narrow form, the spearhead might be assigned a classification of no earlier than Davis Group 6. It measures 67.4mm x 22.8mm x 8.1mm, weighing 33.65g.","fourFigureLat":"53.14400547","fourFigureLon":"-0.37182417","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Ward","datefound1":"October 12, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Metheringham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 925 spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"67.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
