Below the stop ridge a low rib defines a shield-shaped motif from below the base of which a median arris extends as far as the start of the cutting edge. Both sides bear very clear and overall hammer marks, along the edges and transverse across the centre. As a result there is no casting seam. There are smaller hammer impressions along the tops of the flanges and of the stop ridge. Weight 454g. Length 161mm. Width 70mm.
