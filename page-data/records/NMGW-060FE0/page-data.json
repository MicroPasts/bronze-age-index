The spearhead weighs 74.0g. The circular socket end has an external diameter at the mouth of 17.8mm. The end of the socket is decorated with three horizontal grooves around the circumference. The sides of the socket converge towards the blade. Midway between the blade and the end of the socket are attachment loops with oval tops (external dimensions 15 x 5mm). The socket becomes increasingly lozenge sectioned as it approaches the blade. The flame shaped blade is slender and is comparatively slight with a consistent thickness of 1mm and without a bevelled blade edge. The blade has a number of possibly decorative grooves running alongside the midrib. The blade edge is straight and comparatively long (90mm) and has a number of nicks and distortions; this damage is likely to have occurred in antiquity (M. Davis pers comm.). The lozenge sectioned socket develops into pointed and prominent midribs along the blade. A number of small casting flaws are evident on the blade. The surface of the spearhead has survived well and has a mid brown patina. Northover (unpublished) sees socket looped spearheads as a largely Irish type. The type has been known to occur through late Acton Park to Pennard but concentrated in the Cemmaes industry. The mouth decoration, thin and slender blade and pointed midrib on this example are a little unusual. The mouth decoration can be paralleled on a side-looped spearhead from Hod Hill (Pearce 1983, No. 443) and the slender form can be paralleled in examples recorded by Ehrenberg (1977, nos. 25, 26, 28, 140, 143).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.290) and classed within his Type 6B Developed side-looped (Flame, flat blade, lozenge plates). Davis (2012, 76f.) lists 83 of this type of spearhead from Britain, with a concentration around the Thames Valley and a spread across Central England and Wales. Other Type 6B spearheads are recorded from Llwchwr, Swansea (NMGW-060FE0), Trefeglwys, Powys (Davis 2012, No.330) and Newton Beach, Bridgend (Davis 2012, No.336). A Group 6 side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating. However, overall Davis (2012, 108-110) places this group within the Taunton-Penard metalworking phases.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katrina Deering","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Beaumaris","county":"Isle of Anglesey","district":"Isle of Anglesey","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kdeering/DSCN3021.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"163"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
