The awl has a sub-rectangular cross section at one end that may have originally terminated in a flattened wedge-shape, as other examples recorded on this database do. This terminal widens to become more rounded in the centre of the awl with the opposing end tapering to a point. There is some pitting on the surface of the awl which suggests some age, however there is some debate as to the date of such awls, which probably first appeared in the Late Bronze Age but could conceivably have continued to have been made until much later; here the patina does suggests a later prehistoric date.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"0.51","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Boxford","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2012505.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"38.25"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
