The ring is oval in shape and the terminals are flat ended. The ring is cracked and chipped in several places where the inner copper alloy core has corroded underneath, and the terminals have become joined by corroded metal. \n\n\n\nDimensions: Diameter: 15.3mm, thickness: 4.1mm, weight: 3.48g\n\n\n\nDiscussion: A gold-plated lock ring of a similar style on the database (LANCUM-C2543F) that is Bronze Age in date was submitted for consideration as treasure (Treasure case tracking number: 2017T810) and includes the discussion: ‘This penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997).\n\n\n\nHowever, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple 'hair-rings' of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, 'hair-rings' have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal BC and 1373-1019 cal BC respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).\n\n\n\n'Hair-rings' are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O'Connor et al 2008; DCMS 2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (Eluère 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O'Connor et al 2008). There are a number of examples known from Wales, Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, 'Carmarthenshire', Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 & 15).\n\n\n\nLANCUM-C2543F is the first complete example from Cumbria and the only other complete example known from the North West is from Wrenbury practically on the Welsh border. There is another broken example from West Cumbria manufactured from gold sheet rolled into a tube with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 80-82%, silver content of 14-15%, with at least 4% copper. The ring is formed from gold sheet rolled into a curved tube, with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. According to Gillian Varndell Curator, Department of Prehistory and Europe, British Museum. It is probably part of a well-known Bronze Age ornament type (composite ring) dating to c.1300-1100 BC. This find is also close to other gold finds from West Cumbria from a similar period consisting of a penannular bracelet and three lock rings. These finds are very significant for the North West in terms of high status Late Bronze Age activity.\n\n\n\nThe complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 & Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.","fourFigureLat":"51.66095334","fourFigureLon":"0.60109157","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"As the object is over 300 years old and contains more than 10% precious metal, it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act.\n\n\n\nLori Rogerson, Database Volunteer, Essex","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Sophie Flynn","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Sophie Flynn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"15.3","edge":null,"thickness":"4.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Woodham Ferrers and Bicknacre","county":"Essex","district":"Chelmsford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lisapittjones/2019T1068.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
