Complete cast copper alloy socketed axe head. The axe is relatively short. It has a subrectangular body, with sides that flare outwards towards the cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. A small lip runs around the edge of the socket and there is a collar of similar width around the narrowest part of the axe. The axe is otherwise undecorated. Both sides of the axe have a pronounced casting seam running along their centre. There is a loop on one side of the axe, joining next to the collar and extending to about halfway along the blade.\n\n2.    Complete cast copper alloy socketed axe head. The axe is relatively long. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It has a subrectangular body, narrowest in the middle, flaring wider towards the socket and widest at the cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. There is a double raised collar at the socket end. The axe is otherwise undecorated. Both sides of the axe have a pronounced casting seam running along their centre. There is a  loop on one side of the axe, joining next to the collar and extending about a quarter of the way along the blade. \n\n\n\nThe finder has treated both axe heads with Renaissance wax. Photos from before this treatment show a dark green-brown patina. \n\n\n\nDimensions: \n\n1. Length: 98.68 mm    Width: 54.94 mm    Depth: 37.05 mm    Weight: 294.02 g. External mouth dimensions 36.89 mm (side to side) by 39.27 mm (front to back). Internal mouth dimensions 28.35 mm (side to side) by 28.21 mm (front to back). Loop measures 26.24 mm long, 8.27 mm wide and 11.36 mm out from the body of the axe.\n\n2. Length: 116.90 mm    Width: 46.20 mm    Depth: 32.65 mm    Weight: 240.24 g External mouth dimensions 40.05 mm (side to side) by 37.73 mm (front to back). Internal mouth dimensions 28.90 mm (side to side) by 26.40 mm (front to back). Loop measures 21.46 mm long, 11.00 mm wide and 10.56 mm out from the body of the axe.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: 1. Is Type Portree (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, esp nos. 1043 and 1051). 2. Is a socketed axe of Type Wilburton (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos. 1007-1009). They both date from the earlier Late Bronze Age, c. 1125-900BC. The two axes are contemporary, which fits with them having been deliberately deposited together as a hoard. A similar combination of types can be seen in the hoard from Lowthorpe ER Yorkshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 139E).\n\n\n\nConclusion: \n\nThe objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002), which states that any find of two or more base metal objects of prehistoric date qualify as Treasure.","fourFigureLat":"54.69960171","fourFigureLon":"-1.41188876","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Abigail Baker","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Abigail Baker","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Trimdon","county":"County Durham","district":"County Durham","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abigailbaker/NCLE361F6Axe1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Tyne and Wear Museums","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
