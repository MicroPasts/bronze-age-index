The object has a flat sub-oval head, the surface of which is irregular and pitted. This uneven surface was probably created when the molten metal was solidifying. Below extend a pair of sprue elements (feeders) at c.135 degree angles. Each feeder is c.13mm long and D-shaped in cross-section, being flat to the inside surface. Both ends (measuring 12.6x9.6mm and 14.1x10.9mm) have rectangular depressions at the centre.\n\nThe object has a mid- green patina and a lightly pitted surface.\n\nThe jet stands 29.8mm in height, is 33.8mm in length and 22.4mm in max.width (at the head).
