The object is a spiral ring and attributable to the 'ornament horizon' of the Taunton and Penard metalwork phases. The spiral is circular in plan and formed of one overlapping coil which is ovate in cross-section with both terminals tapering to a point. \n\n\n\nThe exterior surface is heavily pitted; the interior has a smooth dark green patina.\n\n\n\nDiameter: 19.81mm, Thickness: 2.85mm, Weight: 2.7g\n\n\n\nSee also SF-4497E7, HAMP-7556B3, ASHM-A4CAD2 and SF-761FF6. There are also examples of comparable spiraloid rings in the Near Lewes hoard (SUSS-C5D042) and the Ockham hoard (SUR-B41DB6), both Middle Bronze Age in date.","fourFigureLat":"52.07958892","fourFigureLon":"-0.83403465","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"19.81","edge":null,"thickness":"2.85","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Castlethorpe","county":"Milton Keynes","district":"Milton Keynes","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARCBBBD74.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
