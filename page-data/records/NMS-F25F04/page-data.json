All faces of the head and beak are intentionally slightly convex, one of the faces set at 90 degrees to the spike has a sub-circular rough divot in alignment to the arris on top, this is very likely to be the remains of a second beak/spike that has broken in antiquity, presumably through use. The remaining original surfaces are dark chocolate brown with the recent losses to the surface now mid-green. There are some inconsistencies with the casting on the head, mostly to the side with the missing projection, the other work surfaces are cleaned up a little after casting, but the the angled top of the head has had more attention, it is neatly finished with slight angled scratches to the surfaces from abrasion, presumably from grinding and polishing with some sort of fine-grained stone, there are at least four impressions from a fine semi-circular punch to the larger work surface of the angled head, there appears to be a much deeper punch mark of the same type just below and to one side of the missing beak.\n\nIf&nbsp;this anvil&nbsp;did have two beaks/becs initially, it would be classified as a Armbruster, B. et al (2019) Class 2 anvil. See&nbsp;NMS-15E1DC&nbsp;for a much smaller example of a broadly similar type from Norfolk, also see:&nbsp;PUBLIC-B21001&nbsp;and&nbsp;KENT-0278AC&nbsp;for other examples&nbsp;recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme.\n\nThe British examples &ldquo;fall into two broad groups; about half the associations are dated to the later Middle Bronze Age and half to the full Late Bronze Age.&rdquo; Ehrenberg , M.R. (1981), page 22, it is likely this example is to be dated to the earlier period, &nbsp;circa. 1,400 to 1,200 BC as the workmanship, patination and condition is consistent with many of the&nbsp;Middle Bronze Age metalwork recovered in Norfolk.","fourFigureLat":"52.58047328","fourFigureLon":"0.8914045","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"October 31, 2021","datefound2":"October 31, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"35.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Scoulton","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jasongibbons/Image2222.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
