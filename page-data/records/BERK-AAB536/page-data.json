Although complete the blade edges are slightly 'nibbled' where they are very thin but where complete the edges are still sharp. There are mulitple scratches along the blade and socket, possibly a result of finishing after being removed from the mould. The internal diameter of the socket is 17.9mm. This spear head is one of several from the area, and a number are known from across Oxfordshire/Berkshire, many associated with watery contexts. Similar leaf-shaped basal-looped spearheads include examples from Marlow, Speen and Wallingford (Ehrenberg 1977 nos 32, 79, 106 and 137 respectively).","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"21","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017077.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"163"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
