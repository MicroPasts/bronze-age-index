It has a sub triangular shape with the remains of a blade. The tip of the blade and the bottom of the socket are missing. At the bottom, just above the break on either side are two nodules, possibly the remains of a set of casting loops. The edges of the blade are worn, with a green patina developing in places, especially along the broken edges of the tip and socket.\n\n\n\nSimilar style spearheads are recorded on the database, DENO-3B0107, WILT-B83B8F. Similar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (c. 1500 - 1150BC).\n\n\n\nThe spearhead weighs 12.39 grams, 42.71mm length, 11.18mm width at its widest, midway up the length, 1.46mm thickness at broken socketed end.","fourFigureLat":"52.25507238","fourFigureLon":"0.95810848","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Bishop","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Bishop","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.46","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wyverstone","county":"Suffolk","district":"Mid Suffolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bpaites/ESS0DF35DMBAspear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"42.71"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
