Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in plan and lozenge in section. The very tip has been lost to old worn breaks and a deep socket is present (18.9mm).\n\n\n\nAn insufficient portion of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-green patina and is pitted and worn. The spear is 37.6mm long, 12.7mm wide, 9.2mm thick and weighs 8.9g.","fourFigureLat":"53.45256031","fourFigureLon":"-0.6010036","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grayingham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/BBA0008.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"37.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
