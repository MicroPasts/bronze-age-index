The object is irregular in plan and curved in profile with one smooth concave face and a rough uneven outer convex face. The outer face is rough and pitted.\n\n\n\nThe edges of the object are uneven and rough but with an even patina due to breaks during antiquity. The object has a light green patina and is probably the result of metal working. The colour, texture, shape and formation of the ingot suggests that it may date from the Bronze age period, however without metallurgical analysis it is difficult to date the ingot precisely and it may be more recent. The object has a mid-green patina.","fourFigureLat":"50.39279678","fourFigureLon":"-3.60513893","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sam Moorhead","datefound1":"September 28, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sam Moorhead","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stoke Gabriel","county":"Devon","district":"South Hams","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sam/DSC01749.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":"64"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
