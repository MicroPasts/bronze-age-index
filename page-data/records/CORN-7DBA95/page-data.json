The butt of the palstave is squared off and is 23 mm wide and 5 mm thick and expands on either side into flanges which protrude upwards at either side by 10 mm. The septum measures 17 mm wide and the stop is 72 mm down the length of the septum and 10 mm deep. There is a shield-shaped moulding with a curved base below the stop, measuring 23 mm in width and 30 mm in length down the blade. At either side of the axehead as the flange tops slope downwards after the stop, there is a transverse ridge that has been chiselled away after casting. The length of the blade from the end of the shield-shaped pattern to the edge of the blade facet measures 55 mm and the blade then slopes downwards to the cutting edge, which is 16 mm in depth. The blade splays outwards nearer the edge to form a semi-circular shape with one of the blade corners having been flattened since deposition, probably through damage. The cutting edge is still quite sharp and has been broadly hammered out initially, followed by finer hammering close to the edge, creating two bevels (Matt Knight pers comm). There is some corrosion on the blade and only patches of the dark green surface patina survive. The casting seam has been chiselled flat on either side of the axe and continues down the overall length of the flange and the blade side as a thin line. Palstaves with shield-shaped decoration and expanded blades can be found during the Acton Park II metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) of the Middle Bronze, such as the palstave illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 128, fig.29, no.92).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar palstave with shield-shaped moulding from Openshaw in plate 57, no.783, which is classified as a primary shield pattern palstave and dated from the Acton metalwork phase.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar local palstave from a hoard found at St Tudy in Cornwall on pages 37 & 79, pl.6, no.78i.","fourFigureLat":"52.58730898","fourFigureLon":"0.59656539","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"May 31, 1960","datefound2":"May 31, 1969","subsequentActionTerm":"In a private collection, recorded for academic use","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"29","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Gooderstone","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June16finds184.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"179"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
