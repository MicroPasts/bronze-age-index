The axe has an overall length of 106.95mm and weighs 176.7g. The butt has suffered some damage, but is narrow and short with a surviving width of 16mm and would have been rounded or possibly even pointed. The sides are straight and diverge gradually to the unexpanded blade. The sides are rounded across their thickness, giving the axe an oval section. The blade has a width of 59.04mm and has a shallow blade edge. The narrow butt, straight sides and shallow edge produce a markedly triangular form to the axe. The faces are gently convex, producing a moderate lenticular long profile. The axe is thickest around its midpoint at 10.02mm. The axe has poor surface preservation with a pale brown patina, areas of the sides and faces have active corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"52.188781","fourFigureLon":"-3.02537071","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2050","notes":"Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency and to make the analyses comparable with other results. Results obtained suggest the axe is made of bronze and is broadly consistent with Early Bronze Age metal types. Metallurgical sampling of the axe would provide greater accuracy on the metallurgical composition. The triangular axe form with straight sides diverging to the unexpanded blade edge would not be consistent with the more common Migdale axe type. Dunnottar axes are typologically midway between copper and bronze axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, p 31) .","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kington Rural","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006102.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"106.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
