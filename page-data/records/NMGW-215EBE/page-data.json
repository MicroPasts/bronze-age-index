The top of the circular socket is evident at the base of the fragment (with a diameter of 6.8mm and a depth of 19mm). The socket defines a prominent rounded midrib on the exterior (with a maximum surviving thickness of 9.0mm), which narrows gradually to the tip. The blade appears comparatively straight along the fragment, possibly suggesting a leaf-shaped blade (with a maximum surviving width of 18.3mm). A small fragment of the blade facet appears to survive above the break. The surface is heavily corroded and no sharpening striations are now evident on the corroded surface, which has a pale-green patina.\n\n\n\nThe socket present on the spearhead would suggest a form was side-looped, basal-looped or pegged but the fragmentary nature makes typological identification difficult.","fourFigureLat":"52.55933773","fourFigureLon":"-2.76847126","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"6.8","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/20145913jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"43.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
