The fragment is approximately triangular in profile and rectangular in section. The blade end survives intact but has corroded surfaces with some encrustation and a  mid-brown to green patina. The sides of the palstave taper inwards from the ends of the blade, before terminating in an old break. This fragment is probably from a palstave, although it could potentially be from the tip of a socketed axe head or a small chisel. \n\n\n\nSimilar examples recorded on the PAS database include: SF-AE99A4 and PUBLIC-0A5278.\n\n\n\nThe overall dimensions are as follows: 40.81mm in length, 29.77mm in width, 5.08mm in thickness and 29.33g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"53.44618518","fourFigureLon":"-0.13441998","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford (LIN)","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford (LIN)","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.08","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wold Newton","county":"North East Lincolnshire","district":"North East Lincolnshire","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/susheelacb/LINFED751.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"40.81"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
