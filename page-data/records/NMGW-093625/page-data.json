Associated within the same soil context as the gold foil (2) were 31 sherds of Middle Bronze Age tradition pottery (1500-1100BC), a rolled-top bronze pin of Middle or Late Bronze Age (1500-800BC) date and an animal bone assemblage. It is possible that the small fragment of gold foil (2) may once have coated a penannular ring (hair-ring). These are a reasonably common class of Bronze Age artefacts, using gold foil for surface decoration. Loose and non-adhered foil is sometimes observed projecting from their terminals. While a number of dated examples belong to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800BC), it is now thought that they started to be manufactured towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC) (e.g. TAR 2004, no. 17; Raftery 2004). In the light of the associated pottery, a Middle to Late Bronze Age date (1300-1000BC) has been suggested for this foil.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"July 02, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Controlled archaeological investigation","parish":"Llan-Maes","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH003186_05.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums and Galleries of Wales","length":"4.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
