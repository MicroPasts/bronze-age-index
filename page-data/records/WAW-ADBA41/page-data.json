The blade portion of the palstave remains with the broken edge traversing the palstave. The broken edge is not too recent. The blade cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical, rounded, blunt, slightly abraded and is convex in plan. The blade has slightly flared sides. Both faces of the palstave has a slightly linear rib running along the length of the axe. The surface of the palstave is slightly abraded with only traces of a mid grey/green patina and a black deposit which is possibly carbon. From the cutting edge to the broken edge the palstave measures 35.98mm, and across the corners of the blade it measures 56.76mm wide and measures 11.61mm thick at the broken edge. It weighs 82.2g.\n\n\nThe palstave dates to the middle Bronze Age, c.1500 to 1300 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.318995","fourFigureLon":"-1.840046","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"Peter Reavill writes: MBA Palstave with central rib - not enough  survives to suggest a sub-type - but probably either Primary - Shield  shaped pattern or a low flanged / mid ribbed type.
