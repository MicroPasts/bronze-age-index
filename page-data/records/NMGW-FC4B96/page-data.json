The butt end is rounded and thins to an edge (with a width of 20.5mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The sides are straight and slightly divergent to the break (with a maximum width of 24.1mm and a thickness of 7.5mm). The sides are convex across their thicknesses with no surviving evidence of the casting seams. The flanges begin at the butt and are slightly convex along the short length to the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 11.0mm with a height above the septum of 2.0mm). There is an angled step on the break which may possibly suggest a cut. The surface has a dark-green brown patina with some pitting and areas of bright green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1] from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
