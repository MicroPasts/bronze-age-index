In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.0 mm (thickness: 2.4 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). \n\n\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nIt measures 72.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.4 mm, width at the butt is 12.0 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 48.6 grams.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
