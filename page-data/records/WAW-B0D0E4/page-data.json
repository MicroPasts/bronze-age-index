The lower portion of the axe remains, including a fragment of the internal socket and blade. Only the tip of the socket is visible before the axe has a broken edge. This break is not recent as the patina on the break matches that on the surface of the axe.  The sides of the axe taper outwards towards the blade tip. The blade tips are not flared outwards and are now rounded, probably due to corrosion rather than wear. The blade cutting edge is rounded and blunt, and is slightly convex in plan. The surface of the axe is abraded, but has patches of a well developed dark grey/black patina. The axe weighs 49.69g. From the cutting edge to the upper edge it measures 49.59mm, across the blade, from tip to tip, it measures 27.56mm wide from the break to the apex of the blade and 12.76mm thick.\n\nThe socketed axe dates to the late Bronze Age, -900 to -700.","fourFigureLat":"52.121269","fourFigureLon":"-2.103654","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"November 01, 2006","datefound2":"January 27, 2007","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Drakes Broughton and Wadborough","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-B0D0E4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"27.56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
