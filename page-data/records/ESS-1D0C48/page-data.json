Half of the fragment has been hammered into a bar with a relatively regular square cross-section. The end appears to have been cut. The remainder of the fragment has not been as highly worked and is a relatively irregular sub-rectangular shape that tapers away to a thinner cross-section. It is not clear whether this end has been cut or whether it has broken.\n\n\n\nThe more highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a fragment with rectangular profile from Chalvington with Ripe in East Sussex (Treasure case: 2008 T425). The less highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a number of probable prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) ingot fragments, including examples from Brabourne in Kent (Treasure case: 2005 T259), Trowse with Newton, Norfolk (Treasure case: 2002 T99), and the more substantial finger-shaped ingot from East Claydon, Buckinghamshire (2013 T850) and West Knoyle in Wiltshire (Treasure case: 2014 T686). It can, therefore, on the balance of probabilities, be considered to be of prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) date.\n\n\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken on the surface of the gold by the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 91-92% gold, 6-7 % silver and approximately 2% copper. This is consistent with a Bronze Age date.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 10.5mm; Sub-rectangular cross-section of 9mm by 5mm; Weight: 11.64g","fourFigureLat":"51.91761179","fourFigureLon":"1.13948243","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Katie Marsden","datefound1":"September 01, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Katie Marsden","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wix","county":"Essex","district":"Tendring","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2013T873a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":"10.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
