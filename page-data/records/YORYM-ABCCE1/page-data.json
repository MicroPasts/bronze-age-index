The hammer is almost complete with some wear on the mouth and base. The hammer body face is almost rectangular, tapering slightly towards the mouth end. There is a lower moulding line and flared collar to the mouth. From a side view the tapering cannot be seen, and the base is rounded. The vertical corners on the hammer body are chamfered, resulting in an octagonal cross-section. The mouth is ovate in shape 27.75mm by 23.51mm. Casting seams can be seen on both sides, evidence of two piece moulding. The hammer surface is smooth with a dark brown patina, where this surface has been lost the metal is rough and a light green.\n\n\n\nThe earliest bronze hammers were created in the Middle Bronze Age Taunton metalwork phase, however hammer finds are more defined in Late Bronze Age hoard discoveries. Socketed hammers became more widespread in the Penard phase (c1200-950BC), and according to Burgess this tradition lasted longer in the North of Britain whereas the characteristics of the Wilburton Phase were prominent in southern Britain during the tenth century BC. Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart-Park Phase which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800BC. Burgess (1968) describes two socketed hammers from the Kilnhurst hoard in Yorkshire, one long and the other short which is similar to the example here. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding. The example described here is more likely a later example in the Penard Phase. Burgess also parallels Penard metalwork to continental examples and in particular western France.\n\n\n\nIn comparison to socketed axes, socketed hammers are a rare find, and to date only 35 recorded and publically accessible on the PAS database, 3 of which were found in North Yorkshire. Similar hammers to this example have been recorded as FAKL-9C9543, LVPL-5A7954 and SWYOR-D13642. The Kilnhurst hammers can be seen in Burgess (1938, Fig. 13, p.18).\n\n\n\nThis hammer is 54.58mm in length, 24.25mm wide, 20.57mm thick and weighs 77g. The mouth has a max diameter of 27.75mm and a minimum of 23.51mm.","fourFigureLat":"53.84253861","fourFigureLon":"-0.93761246","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Kerrie Hoffman","datefound1":"September 01, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Kerrie Hoffman","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.57","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ellerton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khoffman/THC00312.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"54.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
