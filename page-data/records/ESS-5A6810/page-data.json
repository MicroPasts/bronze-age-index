The fragment represents a small part of the lower blade and cutting edge. It is sub-square and wedge-shaped in profile. When viewed in plan, the sides of the body are fairly straight with little outward flare. The original cutting edge no longer exists and the blade tips are worn. There is no casting seam. There is a rectangular aperture in the thicker end of the fragment, which represents the very end of the socket. The axe surface is heavily worn. The original surface of the axe survives in patches and has a mid green patina and the subsequently exposed surface is light green. Break edges are irregular and though not fresh are not especially worn, suggesting that damage occurred in the more recent past. The fragment is 24.02mm long, 27.64mm wide from tip to tip, 25mm wide at the break, 8.82mm thick at the broad end and weighs 15.34g","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.82","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sible Hedingham","county":"Essex","district":"Braintree","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/DSCN2977.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"24.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
