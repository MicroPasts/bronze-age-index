The fragment is triangular in plan and lenticular in cross section. A worn break is present at the lower edge. The edges are worn, and a brown-green patina is on the surface.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 26.68mm in length, 11.26mm in width, 2.53mm in thickness and weighs 2.89g.\n\n\n\nCf. YORYM-D78623 on the database\n\n\n\nDue to the fragmentary nature of this object, it is not possible to say with certainty that it is a dagger, and may be the tip of a different bladed weapon.\n\n\n\nThe curve at the break suggests the weapon may have been broken prior to deposition, possibly by way of ritual decomissioning of the piece.","fourFigureLat":"53.96380474","fourFigureLon":"-0.50772379","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Denise Wilding","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Denise Wilding","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bainton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/CW0361.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"26.68"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
