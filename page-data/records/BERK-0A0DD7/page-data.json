The axehead is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescentic blade which tapers to a thin edge. Along the length of the axe are raised flanges and between them and nearly central is a very faint stop ridge. The flanges are bevelled both above and below the main body of the axe and may have been hammered. The butt end is narrowed and rounded and also tapers to a thin edge. Copper alloy corrosion is more prevalent on one side of the axe with the opposing surface having almost none; this would be as a result of the depositional environment.\n\n\n\nThe axe appears to be from the Arreton phase of metalworking (stage V), which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.53588568","fourFigureLon":"-1.51119771","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"May 09, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lambourn","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2015790.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"99.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
