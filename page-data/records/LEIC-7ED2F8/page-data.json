The object is in fair condition with a brown patina and weighs 310.5 grams. The axe is divided equally by its central straight stop ridge, which is about 3mm wide. The blade contains a small, central semi-circular depression, 5mm deep, which ends at the stop. From here the blade gently tapers outwards with slight flaring at the edge of the rounded blade, 45mm wide. It thins from 21mm at the stop down to 13mm at the centre of the blade. The butt has curved flanges which are at their widest in the centre, giving them an eliptcal form, and stop just past the stop ridge. The very end of the butt is damaged and the axe is missing patches of surface all over, but is generally in fair condition.","fourFigureLat":"52.613197","fourFigureLon":"-1.218684","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"August 21, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leicester Forest East","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Blaby","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/DSCN9028.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"131"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
