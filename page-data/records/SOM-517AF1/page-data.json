The bracelet, which has an internal diameter of 64.5mm, an external diameter of 81.8mm and a width of 16.6mm has a sub-triangular section with a flat inner side and rounded apex running around the centre of the outer side. The surfaces are heavily pitted and there is a crack at one point. The remaining original surface does not show any incised decoration however too much of the surface has been lost to definitively state whether it was decorated or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar plain and incised (Liss-type) bracelets in copper alloy are known from the Taunton phase (1,400 -1,200 BC) of the Bronze Age onwards, mainly from Southern Britain. They are comparatively rarer than tools and weapons. Similar examples were found in the Ebbesbourne Wake hoard (Moore and Rowlands 1972:63-5, Plate XV) and a hoard from Norton Fitzwarren (Needham in Ellis 1989:31-31, 36).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"April 17, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"81.8","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Dorset","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elburnett/SOM-517AF1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
