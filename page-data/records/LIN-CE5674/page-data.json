Only the tip of the the spearhead survives; it has a rounded mid rib with narrow wings. The tip is slightly bent, probably through use, and the wings are chipped, perhaps due to thinning of the metal from corrosion which may have led to some losses from the outer edge of each wing. The surface has a stable, slightly pitted, patinated surface of green-brown colour. The surviving length is 45 mm, with a maximum width of 12mm and weight of 10.34g.\n\n\nA similar, though larger, example (SF8275) can be seen on this database.
