The awl has a weight of 17.0g and has a distorted length of 77.6mm, originally having been approximately 98mm long. The tang had an undistorted length of 62mm and is of rectangular section (8.7mm x 5.8mm at the base of the tang) and gradually tapers to a point. There is no collar or moulding between the tang and the point. The point of the awl has a length of 36.2mm and is of circular section (11.1mm diameter at the apex), gradually thinning to the point. The awl has generally poor surface preservation with a pale to mid-green patina. The awl is difficult to date on form, the patina may suggest some age to the tool although the form is difficult to closely parallel with later Bronze Age types which tend to be slighter and have square sectioned points. Iron Age and later awls are generally made in iron.\n\n\n\nLate Bronze Age types with inset tangs are known from across Britain (WAW-90E4D6; DOR-A9EBD3; SUR-14DC71) and it is likely this object falls within that technological phase.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.112.2.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"77.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
