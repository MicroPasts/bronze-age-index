The longer portion is of rectangular cross section, displays evidence of filing on its surfaces and tapers to a wedge-shaped terminal. The remaining third also has a broadly rectangular cross section, but in this portion the corners have been deliberately removed, probably by filing. The patinated surfaces are almost black in some areas, perhaps suggesting that a coating was applied in antiquity.\n\n\n\nLength: 54.1 mm; maximum width: 4.7 mm.
