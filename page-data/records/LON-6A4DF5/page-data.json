The pin has a globular head with radiating vertical incised lines. The shaft of the pin has a circular cross-section and only slightly tapers to one end. This end is rough and has the appearance of a break. Midway down the shaft is a collar with a perforation through it. The upper section of the pin, between the globular head and perforated collar, is completely covered in engraved decoration. The pattern comprises a band of rings around the shaft then a section of rows of diagonal lines extending along the length of the pin; then a section of four repeating patterns of herringbone motifs with a linear border. This complete pattern is repeated along the length of the pin stopping below the perforated collar, leaving the final remaining third of the pin undecorated. There appears to be some evidence of wear around the perforation on the collar. The collar is also decorated with the same technique as the rest of the pin; the pattern here comprises a double saltire cross on each site of the collar. The copper alloy has a dark green patina.\n\n\n\nDimensions: diameter of globular head: 14.51mm; diameter of shaft: 6.28mm tapering to: 4.66mm; length: 197mm; weight: 52.01g.","fourFigureLat":"51.35527819","fourFigureLon":"0.15283182","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kate Sumnall","datefound1":"April 09, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kate Sumnall","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"14.51","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Crockenhill and Well Hill","county":"Kent","district":"Sevenoaks","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/paitesb123/Robson - IA pin - Apr 10.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of London","length":"197"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
