The socket of the spearhead retains some wood, including a piece that runs through two circular piercings positioned towards the socket mouth. The socket mouth is worn and fragmentary. Two ridges linear ridges at the top of the object are all that remains of the blade: these have been worn down almost to nothing and the object terminates in a sharp point. The sheer level of wear suggests that this may have been intentional, possibly to rework the spearhead into another object such as a ferrule. Only a patch of the original dark brown surface remains. The object is 113.50mm in length, 21.70mm in diameter and weighs 54.08g.","fourFigureLat":"53.92784701","fourFigureLon":"-2.26037754","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss.
