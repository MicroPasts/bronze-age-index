The object is otherwise undecorated.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark brown patina. The surface is moderately pitted. particularly in the thicker area, possibly damaged in use.\n\n\n\n23.85mm diameter (external), 10.23 mm internal diameter. Thickness 8.25 mm at thickest part to 6mm at narrowest. 20.2g\n\n\n\nSimilar rings have been discovered as part of late Bronze Age hoards (see for example: (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, plate 152; YORYM-15AA2D/2014-T442, the latter noting the possibility \"that the ring was a fitting on the haft of a socketed axe\" perhaps explaining why these rings are often found as part of socketed axe assemblages). The PAS database record for for WILT-1A5240 includes the suggestion that rings of this form may have been part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended, or part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron (citing: Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g). This record also notes that the ring may be a form of harness ring (see Note below). Other examples recorded on the PAS database include: LIN-4EE61E; HAMP-6F9658; NARC-5B60BD; WILT-30BB4B; LANCUM-D8A073 etc.\n\n\n\n(Note: The possibility that this ring may have been an early Lewis (2015, 77:) form of Type (i) Plain round Terret ring (excavated examples from secure contexts dating from the 5th century BC to the mid-2nd century BC) was considered. However, Lewis states that this Type is usually made of iron, or iron with a copper-alloy sheath (ibid, 87) thus, and given the relatively small size, an earlier form of Bronze age ring was the preferred interpretation.)\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nGerloff, S., Northover, J.P., 2010.
