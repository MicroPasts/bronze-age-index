The shorter end is probably incomplete, whereas the other side appears to be intact, tapering to a wedge-shaped end. The object has a dark greenish-brown patina and is corroded in places.\n\n\nDimensions: 64.5mm long, 5.8mm high, 4.5mm thick. Weight: 7.23g.\n\n\nThere is some debate as to the date of such awls, which probably first appeared in the Late Bronze Age but could conceivably have continued to have been made until much later. The patination of this piece does suggest a possible prehistoric date.","fourFigureLat":"51.913137","fourFigureLon":"0.135793","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Harvey Cross","datefound1":"April 09, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julian Watters","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Manuden","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jwatters/Awl_12_104a_20.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"St. Albans District Council","length":"64.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
