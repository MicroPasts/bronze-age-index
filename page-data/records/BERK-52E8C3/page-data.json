The chisel is complete and in good condition, only suffering minimal damage to the blades edges and tip. The chisel has a tapering square-sectioned to conical tang; there is a collar seperating the tang from the blade. The blade is sub-triangular in plan, having a thin convex cutting edge at the bottom. The thickness of the blade tapers gradually towards this cutting edge. The object is slightly corroded in places but retains a greenish-brown patina across much of its surface.Tanged chisels are not common finds, and a complete example is even more uncommon. Several tanged chisels, or elements of them, are recorded on this database (for example, see BH-49EAD8). Tanged chisels such as this date from c. 1150-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.64181934","fourFigureLon":"-1.16322953","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"January 01, 2011","datefound2":"January 13, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.83","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dorchester","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2011638.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"90.92"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
