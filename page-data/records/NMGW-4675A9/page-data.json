The mouth is near-straight for most of its length but appears to be turning at the break on one side. There is a prominent collar moulding, thickest at the mouth (at 4.0mm thick and 7.9mm long) and there is no surviving evidence for a casting stub on the mouth. There are no ribs present on the fragment. One side has an irregular break, while the other side, with the suggested turn, has a comparatively straight break. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted.\n\n\n\nThe fragment has few diagnostic features and is difficult to identify confidently. The most frequently recovered socketed tools with mouth mouldings are axes of Late Bronze Age date. However, it is worth stating that the provenance of this find has so far produced an atypical signature of Late Bronze Age artefact types.","fourFigureLat":"51.59214348","fourFigureLon":"-3.97911853","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.201.2jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"22.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
