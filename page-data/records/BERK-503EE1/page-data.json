The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade where the widest point (width 24.21mm) is low down on the blade near the socket.  There is a very pronounced, angular midrib with a lozengiform cross-section becoming round towards the socket.  The midrib runs from the tip and extends into the socket (length: 94.28mm).  There is a groove running parallel to the cutting edge alongside the edge bevel.  Notches and pits are present along the cutting edge but is difficult to determine if this damage is ancient or more modern.  The external surface of the socket has been cast so that is it facetted to form an octagon.  The interior of the socket has a circular section and internally extends 53.40mm into the blade.  On opposing sides of the socket, approximately 10mm from the edge of the socket, are two side loops to attach the spearhead to the haft.  The loops are narrow with a semi-circular profile (width: 1.90mm; length 4.19mm).  Glossy dark green patina. The object is 121.56mm long, 30.91mm wide, the diameter of the socket is 22.45mm and it weighs 79.38g.\n    \n    Ehrenberg, M.R. 1977.  Bronze Age Spearheads from Berks, Bucks and Oxon.
