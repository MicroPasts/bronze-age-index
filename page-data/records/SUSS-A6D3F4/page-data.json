Such a small fragment is difficult to securely identify; it is possibly a St Nazaire Type sword such as those found in the Wilburton hoard from the Late Bronze Age or perhaps a riveted dagger or rapier. \nThe fragment is roughly rectangular with curved left and right edges and slightly narrower at one end than the other. The top and bottom edges are straight breaks, the patina suggests these are old. In cross section the piece has a central oval ridge from which it tapers in a straight line front and back to each side blade. Parallel to the left and right edges on both sides run four closely spaced incised lines. \nIt measures 38.8mm by 30.4mm and is 5.9mm thick. It weighs 24.34grams.","fourFigureLat":"50.917487","fourFigureLon":"-0.635692","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-800","notes":"Drawing by James Cope","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"January 27, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Liz Walker","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sutton","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lburnett/SUSS-A6D3F4 drawing.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"38.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
