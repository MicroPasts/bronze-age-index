The date is difficult to determine because riveted bronze sheet vessels have been known since the Late Bronze Age and Norfolk is rich in Bronze Age metalwork. However, the vessel could also date from the IA, Roman or Medieval Ages. The rim of the vessel was made from two layers of bronze sheet, held together by rivets, two of which are still in place. The double layer of sheet metal around the rim probably served as enforcement. A parallel for this piece comes from the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age settlement of Potterne, Wilts.
