It has a central narrowed constriction, undecorated and with a vertical step down to it, which is curved on the top and has a rounded hollow on the underneath, c. 7mm in diameter. The constriction measures c. 9mm thick and 13mm wide. To either side is a thicker, tapering, drooping element, D-shaped in cross-section although slightly rounded rather than completely flat on the underside. The upper surface of each half is curved with no surviving trace of the usual engraved linear decoration and with rounded rather than pointed terminals. \n\n\n\nThe whole object is worn and pitted. It is 26mm from end to end, 13.5mm wide when viewed from the top, and measures 12mm from top to bottom when viewed from the side. It weighs 12.73g. There is little dating evidence available for these enigmatic objects. An example was found with the Salisbury Hoard, indicating a Bronze or Iron Age date; the style might suggest an Iron Age date.\n\n\n\nCompare NARC-6A4546, LVPL-B000C6, HAMP-6F4C45, PUBLIC-E9E1C5, NARC-925E14, WILT-616785, KENT-77A0BF and SF-722CF5.","fourFigureLat":"52.5214531","fourFigureLon":"1.41830034","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"40","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Steven Ashley","datefound1":"January 21, 2020","datefound2":"February 17, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Steven Ashley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"12","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Seething","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/64093_901ADA_BA_UO.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
