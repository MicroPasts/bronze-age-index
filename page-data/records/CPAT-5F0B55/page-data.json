The rounded cutting edge (37mm wide) shows signs of having been slightly flared, though one side is partly missing. The body of the axe has a bevel, approximately 55mm from the cutting edge, but this is not very pronounced. The axe tapers back to a thin, semi-circular butt (19mm wide). The axe is heavily corroded with no sign of decoration.\n\n\n\nNote - Peter Reavill - 18/5/21.\n\n\n\nThanks are extended to Dr Brendan O'Connor who has suggested that this axe form is now better understood after the recent publication of Stuart Needham 2017: The Classification of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age Copper and Bronze Axe-head from Souther Britain.\n\n\n\nO'Connor notes: This axe previously suggested as a possible Type Migdale is highly unlikely and although extensive corrosion makes it difficult to be certain where in Needham's Class 4 to place it I believe that it should probably be later rather than earlier c. 2000-1800 BC","fourFigureLat":"53.133298","fourFigureLon":"-2.95804","fromdate":"2000","todate":"1800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jeff Spencer","datefound1":"May 31, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dodleston","county":"Cheshire West and Chester","district":"Cheshire West and Chester","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jspencer/2487-0005.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"100"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
