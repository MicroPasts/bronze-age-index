The blade is solid and lozenge shaped in cross section. The tip is rounded and worn and a central, raised midrib runs vertically down the middle of both sides of the blade. There is a worn break at the base with knicks and worn areas on both edges of the blade. The fragment has lost all its diagnostic features and so the classification cannot be further refined.\n\n\n\nThe blade is dark green in colour. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: length: 32.40mm; width; 7.57mm; thickness: 3.72mm and weight 2.21g. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: Similar examples on the database include; SWYOR-1F74C1; WMID-95EB72 and WMID-7DD405 all of which date to the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.8504928","fourFigureLon":"-0.3251112","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.72","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coombes","county":"West Sussex","district":"Adur","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/EB9054.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"32.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
