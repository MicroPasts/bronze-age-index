The awl is a shaft which, at the mid point, is sub-square in section. It has slightly rounded corners. One side of the awl tapers to a long blunt point. As it tapers it becomes sub-rectangular in section with rounded corners. The opposite terminal also tapers, but does not lose as much width or depth and continues to have a sub-square section. This terminal also finishes with a blunt point. Therefore in profile the awl is an asymmetrical lentoid. The awl has a well developed mid green patina. It measures 34.04mm long, 4.45mm wide and 4.01mm thick. It weighs 2.24g.\n\nThe awl probably dates to the Bronze Age. Needham (in Longley, D. & Needham, S 1980 ‘Runnymede Bridge 1976: Excavations on the site of a Late Bronze Age settlement’, Surrey Archaeological Society Volume 6, page 19.) discusses awls and comments they cannot be dated with accuracy within the Bronze Age period as they are found in Early Bronze Age contexts, such as graves as well as Middle and Late Bronze Age hoards.","fourFigureLat":"52.307936","fourFigureLon":"-1.282737","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.01","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grandborough","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-457962.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"34.04"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
