The socket (with a surviving depth of 34.5mm and a maximum surviving internal diameter of 14mm and 20mm external) is open on one face and appears to have been sub-circular to oval. The interior of the socket is particularly roughly cast at its base but has undergone more finishing near the break. There are remnant stubs on one side, possibly suggesting loops for binding a spearhead. The spearhead width expands slightly where the blade would have begun (to 21.5mm) before the straight sides converge to the point. Both face are convex and rounded and the more complete face has a slight concavity along its length. The converging sides appear damaged with the stubs of the blade evident. There is a concave stepped moulding at the top of the socket on both faces where remnants of the patina survive. The remnant surface has a green-brown patina and elsewhere has a pale-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary aspect and poor preservation of the artefact makes any identification difficult, the form however is consistent with Bronze Age spearheads and the remnant stubs on the side of the socket may suggest a spearhead of side-looped type and of Acton Park metalworking, dating to c. 1600 - 1400BC. The step moulding on the faces is more difficult to parallel but it is likely that the curve echoed the curve of the missing blade edge, emanating from the sides of the moulding.","fourFigureLat":"51.47355559","fourFigureLon":"-3.484404","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.130.1jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"67.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
