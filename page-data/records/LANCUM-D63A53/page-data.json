The head is leaf-shaped and the socket has a pronounced midrib. The tip of the spearhead is thicker than the rest of the blade and there are very fine, very clear re-sharpening marks all around the edges of the wings, running parallel to it. The hollow of the socket extends into the spear. It is circular and tapers towards the tip, becoming lozengiform in cross section as it develops into the solid mid-rib between the blades. There are two small, oval, pierced side loops set opposite each other part way along the socket. There are traces of casting lines along the sides of the spearhead running from above the side loops to the base of the blades. Below the side loops, the casting lines appear to have been smoothed away. The spearhead is has a smooth chocolate-brown patina. The length is 150mm, the width is 27mm thickness 17mm and the weight 74.56g.\n\n\n\nSide-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.","fourFigureLat":"53.84663226","fourFigureLon":"-2.38146836","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"September 03, 2017","datefound2":"September 03, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pendleton","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMD63A53.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"150"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
