The object is slightly bent in profile and has a prominent mid-rib.\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments \"I think I prefer this as a rapier as the central rib shouldn't go to the tip - unless there is an oval in the bottom of the section which would be the tip of the socket\" (March 2014 pers.comm.).","fourFigureLat":"51.93952661","fourFigureLon":"-1.31771861","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"August 24, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.09","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Middle Aston","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-983EE4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"23.71"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
