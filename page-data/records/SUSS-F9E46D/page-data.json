The palstave comprises a broad, curved blade, fan shaped. It tapers back from the blade in an arc before levelling out to form the main body of the axe. There is a well defined mid rib running from the central transverse ridge to approx 30mm fro the blade, there are some other visible shorter ridges to either side, these are 20mm long. There are casting seams that run along the length of the top and the bottom of the object. The rear half of the object is defined by the socket of the axe, formed of two flanges upon the top and bottom with a deep recess. This is mirrored on both sides of the axe. The whole axe has a green patina\n\n\n\n Similar but not identical palstaves can be found in Savory 1980, pg169, no.151, 157","fourFigureLat":"50.80714233","fourFigureLon":"0.12753295","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edwin Wood","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Alfriston","county":"East Sussex","district":"Wealden","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/PalstaveSUSSF9E46D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"176"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
