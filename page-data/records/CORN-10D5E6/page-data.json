The blade is narrow with straight sides with a slight taper towards the broken end so that the blade is slightly flanged, but one side is damaged and incomplete so that the actual edge is unclear. The cutting edge of the blade is rounded and blunt, though affected by corrosive pitting and later damage. The broken end of the blade, which is 39 mm wide and 14.5 mm thick, is just below the end of the socket which would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has mostly corroded away, with patches of dark green patina, but much of the surface is covered in light green bronze disease. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, also refered to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but sparse. They date from the end of the Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase, and into Hallstatt C (c.800-700 BC).\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar Amorican socketed axes from Newlyn, Carn Brea and Penquite, in Cornwall, on pages 421 & 424-5, plates 14 & 17, nos.115, 129c & 134.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate similar socketed axes from Cornwall on pages 38 & 97, plate 24, nos.100-101.","fourFigureLat":"50.08633559","fourFigureLon":"-5.32844843","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"February 11, 2016","datefound2":"February 11, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Breage","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/March16finds042.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
