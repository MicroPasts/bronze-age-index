The axe is complete and in good condition and has a crudely incised shield pattern on either side below the stop ridge. Both side show extensive evidence of hammering as well as sharpening striations on the blade.\n\n\nThe length of the axe is 141.11mm and the width of the blade is 53.96mm. The maximum thickness is 25.49mm and the axe weighs 335g.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments:\n\n\nThis is a Primary Shield pattern unloopeed pastave. The notch in the butt seems relatively common.The axe is very wedge-like in shape and the out-turned crescentic tips of the cutting edge are  relatively uncomnmon in this style of axe. There are some features that  remind me of the later short flanged axes of the type Lissett, variant  Baldersby (plate 51-2 of Schmidt and Burgess)","fourFigureLat":"51.424145","fourFigureLon":"0.314299","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25.49","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Southfleet","county":"Kent","district":"Dartford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCN6815.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"141.11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
