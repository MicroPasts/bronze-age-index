Only a fragment of the axe survives, including the blade end. There is a worn transverse break across the socket. The socket was originally rectangular, but has been crushed inwards along one edge. The surviving section of axe is sub-rectangular with a triangular profile. The sides are straight, expanding out slightly at the blade end. There are casting flashes along both sides. The blade is straight and is quite worn, however the wear is more pronounced on one side. The axe has a worn surface and an even mid green patina. The fragment is 28.29mm long, 35.01mm wide and 13.33mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"51.077137","fourFigureLon":"-1.473221","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"1 of 4 fragments of different socketed axeheads found in the same area.
