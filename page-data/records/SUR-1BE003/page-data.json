The butt is 101.40mm long and 41.84mm wide and has broken at the start of the splayed blade.\n\n\nVery little of the original surface of this axe survives and the present surface is rough and deeply pitted. On both sides of the lower part of the septum, adjacent to the break are areas of decoration. The decoration is very difficult to interpret clearly as only a few patches survive undamaged. On the better preserved side the decoration appears as three transverse bands of diagonal crosses with some straight transverse lines. One band can be discerned on the other side. The axe may have had a slight median bevel. The decoration may have continued onto the blade. In any case what is now visible would have been covered by the haft when in use.","fourFigureLat":"50.949913","fourFigureLon":"-1.232654","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"November 01, 2011","datefound2":"November 30, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishops Waltham","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCN5327.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"101.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
