The surviving mouth is uneven and irregular because of insufficient bronze to fill the mould during casting. The mouth has an oval profile with external dimensions of 46.95mm x 38.28mm (37.85 x 30.55mm internal). One face is higher at the mouth and appears to be turning out slightly, before it would have formed a slight mouth moulding. There is no evidence for whether the casting process employed a two-runner or four-runner technology. The collar is deep (26mm) and is concave on the more complete face. The remains of the loop begin beneath the mouth and are confined within the collar. The casting seams are prominent on both sides but have been finished. The sides are straight, but are beginning to flare outwards at the break. Beneath the collar, the axe has a sub-rectangular body profile. Both faces are decorated with three short (35mm) parallel ribs, which begin at the base of the collar. The axe has a width of 46.94mm and a thickness of 16.72mm at the break The surface of the axe is in good condition with a mid to dark green patina, additional black deposits on the surface may be the remains of an applied tenorite deposit. The axe is of an unusual form, with the loop confined within the collar. An axe recovered from Sesswick, Wrexham (Savory 1980, pp 108, No. 194, fig. 25) also has a deep and concave collar and is decorated with three short parallel ribs, although the loop begins at the base of the collar and the axe mouth is of sub-rectangular profile.","fourFigureLat":"51.679108","fourFigureLon":"-2.623307","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.72","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tidenham","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Forest of Dean","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200636.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"80.87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
