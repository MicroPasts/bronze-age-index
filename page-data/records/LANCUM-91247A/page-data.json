The axe shares similarities with the Taunton metalwork assemblage and Hotham related to the palstaves of the Acton Park metalwork assemblage to which it bears some resemblance similar to Needham et al fig 140 (1985) and Read (1995: p.3 fig 9 ). The axe is almost complete with a length of 123mm. The butt is slightly concave and has a width of 20mm. The flanges are flat, longiform in plan, straight and parallel as far as the stop, with a width of 20mm. The blade is flaring 42mm wide with a slightly bevelled facet possibly as a result of hammering. The septum is pronounced with a central rib down the length of the blade and the edge of the butt maybe slightly broken. The axe has a green patina with green colouration in patches and there are various nicks along the length. The axe is 20mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away and the weight is 171.06g. The axe is warped and may have been miscast. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.\n\nThe palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops but it has a midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group I type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC.\n\nSchmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.\n\nThe concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches\n\nBritish Bronze Age metalwork.
