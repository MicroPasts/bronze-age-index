Cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a very shallow lenticular side profile. The flanges are slightly triple-faceted, so are slightly angled inwards on both face.\n\n\n\nThe axe has a very low ridge about two thirds of the way along the septum (c.45 mm from the butt), which may indicate the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion, . The blade is18.66 mm deep and has an even crescentic cutting edge,.\n\nThe surface is slightly pitted in some areas, but otherwise quite smooth and an even dark green-brown\n\n\n\nDate: Early Bronze Age to Middle Bronze Age - c. 1800 - 1500 BC\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill suggests that the axe dates to an Aylesford or Arreton metal working phase with a date in the final early Bronze age (EBA III) or the first part of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I).\n\n\n\nDimensions: 84.19 mm x 42.45 mm x 11.50 mm\n\nWeight: 103.77 mm","fourFigureLat":"50.66355073","fourFigureLon":"-2.51071662","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"103.77","edge":null,"thickness":"11.37","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Portesham","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucybev/DORA727D7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"84.19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
