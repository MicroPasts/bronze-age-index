The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow and thin rounded butt end which extends to a curved cutting edge with splayed blade. Raised flanges are present along the edges of both sides of the axehead each showing signs of heavily wear. No casting flashes are visible though this may be due to the advance nature of the corrosion.\n\nThe metal has a mid brownish-green colour and is worn. The axehead is 112.1mm long, 50.2mm wide at the blade, 21.9mm wide at the butt end, 18.1mm thick and weighs 233g.","fourFigureLat":"53.95077","fourFigureLon":"-0.980578","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dunnington","county":"York","district":"York","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/DD0004a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"112.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
