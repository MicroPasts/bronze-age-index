The blade is triangular in shape and one side-edge appears to be missing. The blade is apparantly 15.5mm long to the chamfered cutting edge, much of which is worn/ broken away. \nBelow the socket the blade is 33.5mm wide and 4.8mm thick, being triangular in section so thinning to the cutting edge. The blade is separated from the socket by a light incised groove beneath it on booth sides.\nThe socket is v-shaped in section and to the break, 3.6mm high. At this point it is 4.4mm wide. At the surviving edge, the socket appears to curve round it.\nThe socket is set at a slight angle, presumably useful for a cutting implement.\nThe incomplete object measures 41.4x20.9x4.8mm and weighs 14.48g.","fourFigureLat":"51.114163","fourFigureLon":"-2.172809","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-701","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"March 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Deverill","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Bancroftrazor.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"41.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
