The mount is of bulbous bi-lobed form (21.5mm wide and 13.1mm thick) with a curving point projecting from each lobe. At the centre is a shallow rounded groove, widest at the base. Both lobes are decorated with prominent ribbing defined by grooves. The lobes terminate in gently curving points of rounded D-shaped section, slightly flattened on their interiors. The points are not decorated and the interior, near the centre is less finished than the rest of the mount. At the centre is an irregular, sub-circular depression or hollowing (6.6mm wide, 7.6long and 4.2mm deep). The interior is not finished and would not have been seen. The surface has a dark-brown patina with orange brown residue or corrosion surviving in the deeper grooves.\n\n\n\nThe object, often referred to as a 'moustache' is recognised object form but poorly understood in terms of its function and date. The object form is quite consistent, being bi-lobed and rounded, often with ribbed decoration and with projecting prongs. An example of the type was found with the Salisbury Hoard and indicates a Bronze or Iron Age date although the style would suggest a Late Bronze to Iron Age date. It has been suggested that the mount may have been used on Iron Age weapons and it seems possible that the pronged form may be consistent with its use as a scabbard chape, although this remains a conjectural identification.","fourFigureLat":"51.83026815","fourFigureLon":"-2.88660062","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 11, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"22.9","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantilio Crossenny","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/201725copy.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"23.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
