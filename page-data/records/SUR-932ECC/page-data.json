The original mushroom rivets are lost. The dirk is 43.5mm wide across the butt and narrows to 14.5mm at the blade tip, which has been lost. The blade has bevelled edges and a flattened lozengiform / lentoid cross section with a distinctive central rib which extends all the way from butt to the tip. This thickened rib adds strength to the blade and is a diagnostic feature of this type of short sword or dirk which is thought to be used for thrusting and piercing rather than cutting and slashing. The blade is slightly bent midway along although it is unclear as to whether this demonstrates an intentional pre-depositional act. The edges of the blade and the surface demonstrate post depositional damage and loss from corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"50.94769622","fourFigureLon":"-0.94798718","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"This dirk is perhaps best attributed to a Taplow or Keelogue Type of the Acton Park industry.
