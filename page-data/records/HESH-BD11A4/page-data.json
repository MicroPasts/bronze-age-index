The fragment is irregular in plan but is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a C shaped cross section forming a hollow socket and cast side loops. The fragment narrows along its length and its cross-section changes from a shallow C section at the base to an angular U shaped section at the opposite end. The fragment is likely to be waste from a miscast with only one part of the mould being filled with bronze. The casting fragment measures 37.5mm length, has a maximum width of 13.4mm and maximum thickness of 6.4mm. It weighs 4.97 grams. \n\nThe blade (sides and tip), and base of the spearhead is lost and the fragment has been rolled in the ploughsoil making the edges irregular. All that survives of the spear is the central part of the socket, from the base of the blade to just below the two string-like loops. One of these loops is broken; the other is 9.8mm long, 2.7mm wide and project 2.8mm. The internal dimension is 4.5 x 2.2mm. The cross section of both the loops is sub-oval. The style of this type of loop is known as ‘string’ due to the small size and nature. These two loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead\n\nThe spearhead is a mid green colour with an even (but slightly flaky) patina. The patina has been abraded in several areas and there are several areas with an unstable surface. Some of these unstable surfaces have been caused by corrosion, which has caused the metal to laminate slightly. The inner socket of the spear is a mid green black colour and has a similar flaky patina. Similar coloured patinas can be seen on Late Bronze Age axes of the South Wales type specifically around the mouths and around the decorative ribs. It is unlikely that this affect has been caused by the burial environment as the outer surface would have a similar patina. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket. \n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham’s Period 5 (c. 1500 – 1150 BC). A direct parallel has not been found for this casting fragment, although detailed searches of Middle Bronze Age hoards and Metalworking sites may provide a good comparison.","fourFigureLat":"52.04694032","fourFigureLon":"-2.75964803","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Peter Reavill","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hereford","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-BD11A4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"37.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
