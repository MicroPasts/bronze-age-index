The fragment consists of the cutting edge and lower blade of a mid to late Bronze Age axe (1500 - 800 BC). The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan with a slight curved convex cutting edge. The sides, adjacent to the cutting edge, taper inwards towards the break. In section the fragment is sub-triangular. The fragment measures 48.3mm width, 35mm length, and is 12mm thick. It weighs 70.25 grams. \n\n\n   \n   The convex cutting edge of the axe fragment, although corroded and slightly abraded by the soil, is worn and shows areas of possible sharpening. The break at the top is old. It has also suffered from corrosion, however, there are a number of large sub-oval and circular holes or pits in the metal. The majority of these may have been formed through corossion, but the largest is probably an air-pocket in the metal formed when the axe was cast. This would have weakened the blade of the axe at this point and probably contributed to it breaking here. It is a dark mid-green brown colour with an even patina. However, there are a number of patches of light green powdery (active) corrosion present.","fourFigureLat":"52.632269","fourFigureLon":"-2.592444","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"March 03, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Peter Reavill","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sheinton","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-2E7020.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
