The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side profile of the axe is lentoid with both terminals tapering. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe is decorated with short incised probably chiselled lines below the stop ridge and along the length to the blade. The butt end of the axe has been hammered flat creating a proto-stop ridge. The blade tip flares outwards from the body forming a concave hollow. The blade appears to be symmetrical. There is an obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge where it has been hammered for sharpening. The surface of the axe has a dark greenish-brown patina. The length is 133mm, the width of blade is 78mm, width of butt is 28mm, thickness 18mm.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being \"notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. The decoration could reveal an Irish influence.","fourFigureLat":"53.84663226","fourFigureLon":"-2.38146836","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"May 31, 2017","datefound2":"May 31, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pendleton","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMFF1A46.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"133"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
