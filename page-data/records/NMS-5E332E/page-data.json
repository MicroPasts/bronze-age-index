The mouth of the socket is missing. It now commences in an old break just below the side loops. One loop is incomplete due to old damage; both are now filled with brown corrosion product. The socket tapers into the blade, creating a lozengiform mid-rib which extents beyond the socket. The tip of the blade is missing due to old breaks. The edges of the blade are broken and heavily abraded. The spear exhibits a heavily pitted dark green patina with smooth dark brown patches in places.\n\n\n\nSee: Davis, R. 2012.
