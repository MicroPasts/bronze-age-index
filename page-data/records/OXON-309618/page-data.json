Only the tip of the spear remains.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is triangular in plan, tapering to the spear's point. It has a circular midrib that is solid and runs to the point of the spear from which the flat blade edges of the spear extend these narrow in width to meeting the point. The fragment has a dark green patina that is chipped away in places. \n\n\n\nThe fragment is 58mm long, 17mm wide, 8.4mm thick and weighs 18.44 grams.\n\n\n\n Not enough of the spearhead has remained to be able to date this fragment to a more precise range, although the circular section, the angle of the blade, and the midrib extending to the to the tip suggest comparisons with spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.","fourFigureLat":"51.29406035","fourFigureLon":"-1.8723101","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"\nThis find was recorded by images and information provided by the finder, not seen by the FLO.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"February 23, 2019","datefound2":"February 23, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wilsford","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON309618.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
