The butt (with a width of 22.8mm and a thickness of 3.2mm) is straight and perpendicular to the sides. The sides are straight and slightly widening to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 32.4mm, where the stops have a height of 24.5mm) before prominent side mouldings or ‘nicked sides’ (giving a width of 36.5mm). The sides are gently curved along the blade, before flaring out to the blade tips, producing an  expanded and rounded blade edge, slightly damaged at the blade tips (with a blade width of 77.1mm and a blade depth of 22mm). The casting seams are barely evident on both sides and have been neatly finished, particularly on the sides of the blade. The flanges rise from the beneath the butt (17mm beneath) and have a gentle curve reaching their apexes above the stop (20mm above where the flanges have a height of 34.6mm and a thickness of 24.4mm at the stop). The septum is near-straight and slightly rounded across its width (33mm long and 18 – 19mm wide). The stops have a slight curve across their widths, are vertical sided (with a stop height of 8.4mm - 8.8mm and are raised above the faces (with a height of 4mm-5mm and a thickness of 5mm). A single rib extends from the stop on each blade face (for a length of 44mm and 49mm). The faces are slightly hollowed each side of the rib to suggest raised blade edges. There is a subtle rounded blade facet evident on both faces (19mm - 20mm from the blade edge). No obvious sharpening striations are discernible on the blade. The surface has begun to laminate at the blade edge and is damaged on one flange, otherwise the surface has a mid to dark-red brown patina.  \n\n\n\nThe palstave is of Early Midribbed Type and its broad form with subtle ‘flange extensions’ and prominent nicked sides, all indicate Type Chepstow, which corresponds to Acton Park metalworking and can be dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
