Probably Ewart Park, c.1100- 800 BC.\n\n\nAlthough it is in two pieces, it is complete except for the hilt, which has broken at the shoulder, it is missing the grip and finial.\n\n\nThe edges of the blade are slightly damaged, and the tip appears slightly bent. It widens at the mid-blade point, before narrowing towarsd the waist. The waist and start of the mid-blade are also the thickest part, with a raised mid-rib.\n\n\nFrom the waist the sword widens, at the ricasso, giving the lozenge-shaped start of the hilt. One side is broken. On the more complete side, two circular holes are visible at the edge.\n\n\nIt appears to have been broken deliberately before deposition. There is some damage at the hilt, partly due to bronze corrosion, but possibly due to mis-casting.","fourFigureLat":"54.225102","fourFigureLon":"-0.559675","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"March 13, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brompton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Scarborough","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/frances/DUR-CBD092_both.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
