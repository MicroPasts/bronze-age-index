The butt is incomplete and damaged which makes the original shape difficult to determine. Two C-shaped incomplete rivet holes or notches lie in the upper part of the butt, which is where the handle would have been attached. The notches are spaced approximately 24.82 mm apart. Slight shadow (shallowing of the metal) of the handle is visible just under the rivet holes extending centrally to the top of the break.\n\nThis widest point (49.52 mm) is at the shoulders. The blade extends c. 290 mm from the base of the butt and is approximately 30.61 mm wide at the very top, and narrows to 25.20 mm for much of the length of the blade, gradually narrowing further towards the tip of the blade (7.02 mm). The edge of the blade is damaged in several areas where small notches are missing. On either edge of the blade approximately 54.31 mm from the tip of the blade is a V-shaped notch (one is slightly more pronounced than the other and they are not quite parallel). These look intentional but may of course be damage.\n\nBelow the shoulder and extending into the blade, the edge is curved. This is apparent to one edge only as the other is badly disfigured with irregular notches, possibly the result of corrosion as there are large spots or pits close to the edge, presumably corrosion.\n\nA central, clearly defined mid rib extends the length of the blade to the uppermost part of the butt and is slightly more pronounced on one face. The blade lozengiform in cross section.\n\nThe surfaces have a dark patina, though one face is very smooth and shows a golden-brown original surface colour. Both faces show heavy pitting along the entire surface of the object.\n\nThe total length of the object is 335 mm. The thickness varies along the blade from 6.85 mm towards the top, to 1.43 mm at the tip. It weighs 182 g (to the nearest 2 g).\n\nThe rapier has some similarities in terms of dimensions, possible butt shape and rivet hole placement to Burgess and Gerloffs's (1981) Group IV - Type Cloontia (or Group IV: Miscellaneous weapons with archaic butts).","fourFigureLat":"50.8969587","fourFigureLon":"-1.40415788","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Therese Kearns","datefound1":"January 01, 1955","datefound2":"December 31, 1956","subsequentActionTerm":"Part of an extant museum collection","recorder":"Therese Kearns","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.85","discoveryContext":"Building work","parish":"Bargate","county":"City of Southampton","district":"City of Southampton","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP4E8C83.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"335"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
