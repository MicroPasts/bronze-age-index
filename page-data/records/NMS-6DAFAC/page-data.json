Two similar objects to no.29 were recovered as part of a Late Bronze Age hoard in Norfolk (nos. 17 and 18 from HER 36176). The total weight of these 29 objects is 2289.5g.\n\n\n\nAddendum 3rd October 2016:\n\n\n\nSeven additional objects were discovered by the same finder between 10/08/2016 and 14/09/2016. They are as follows:\n\n\n\n30. “Bugle-shaped” object. Probable strap or harness fitting. Hollow tubular body with expanded terminals at either end.

There is a shallow groove on the body surrounding the loop. The surface has a silvery patina indicative of a high tin content. Length: 60.6mm; diameter: 11.6mm; weight: 25.8g.\n\n\n\n31. Fragment of miscast object, possibly a palstave or chisel. Rectangular-sectioned with an old break at one end. The other end, possibly the blade end is expanded and possibly miscast. Deep cut mark across the blade end on one face and across the butt end on the other face. Length: 35.1mm; width: 28.4mm; thickness: 9.6mm, weight: 44.6g.\n\n\n\n32.

Weight: 54.4g.\n\n\n\n36. Penannular ring. Crushed and distorted gold lock-ring. Triangular in section and formed from three strips of sheet gold. One of the strips is undecorated. The other two faces are composed of a series of twisted gold wires fused, or possibly soldered together. Length: 36.1mm; width: 11.4mm; thickness: 4.5mm; weight: 2.7g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: A similar object to no. 30 was recovered as part of the Late Bronze Age Eaton Hoard.","fourFigureLat":"52.74536424","fourFigureLon":"1.45063533","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-701","notes":"Update: a further socketed axehead was recovered from the same area in January 2018 and reported as 2018T593 (NMS-D74E8B).
