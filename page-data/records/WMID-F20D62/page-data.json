The butt is narrow and rounded and measures 14.2 mm in width and is 2.7 mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than cast flanges. The flanges extend 1.0 mm above the body of the axe head. The expanded blade measures 23.8 mm in width and is 2.5 mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 52.5 mm in length, maximum width of 23.7 mm (blade), minimum width 14.2 (butt), width 17.4 mm (centre). It is 2.7 mm thick at the blade, 2.7 mm thick at the butt, and 8.0 mm thick at the central point. It weighs 35.6 g.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is a dark brown colour, with an even but pitted surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThis axehead is similar to those recorded on the PAS database as DOR-28154A and NMS-370DE4, consistent with that of the Arreton type axe, of Early Bronze Age III dating, metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire) commented on DOR-28154A that the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 420, 423and 413). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.","fourFigureLat":"52.77747554","fourFigureLon":"-1.83837298","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hamstall Ridware","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/flanged_axe_headcopy.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"52.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
