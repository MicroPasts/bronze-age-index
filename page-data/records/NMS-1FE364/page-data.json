The cutting edge is convex and complete, although worn. At the opposite end the fragment terminates in a worn and fairly straight transverse break (a long oval in cross-section). From the break to the cutting edge it expands in width with straight sides, only very slightly concavely flaring out at the lateral tips. It tapers in thickness slightly convexly from the break to a point at the tip. The socket survives to depth of eleven millimetres. The external surface is patinated dark brown and pale-green.
