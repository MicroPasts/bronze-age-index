The spearhead's blade is a sub-oval / leaf-shaped with central rib, hollow socket and cast semi-circular side loops along the shaft. The socket appears to be at its full length although there is damaged around the socket opening. The overall shape of the blade can be described as being leaf-shaped. It has straight sides at the point end, with a rounded base near the socket. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the shaft and socket of the spear.The object has a smooth dark brown to olive green patina which is pitted in places. Some of the blade edge is damaged.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 97.93mm long, 15.23mm thick, 17.21mm wide and 26.24g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"51.14044367","fourFigureLon":"1.27231589","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"LVPL-893C73 is a similar example (among others on the PAS database) and the record notes that \"Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age.
