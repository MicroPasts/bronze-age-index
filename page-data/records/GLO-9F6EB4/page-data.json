The interior of the socket has a sub-square shape with rounded corners and measures 29x34 at the aperture. There is a small projection in the centre of each of the sides on the top edge of the socket, these are the filed down remains of the runner's and risers from the casting process. The edge of the aperture is surrounded by a thick tapering collar that has a semi-circular loop that projecting from one side in a low arch to join onto the side of the axe. On both faces are three long and pronounced straight ribs with tapering terminals that emanate from the base of the collar. The sides of the axe are very slightly bevelled with a very low central ridge on which is situated the casting seam. The edges expand outwards very slightly to the curved blade on the forward edge, which has a heavily corroded forward edge.\n\nLength 115mm, width 69mm, thickness 45mm, weight 368g\n\n\n\nItem 2\n\nLate Bronze Age socketed axe dating to 1100to 800 BC. The interior of the socket has a sub-square shape with rounded corners and measures 31x25 at the aperture. There is a small projection in the centre of each of the sides on the top edge of the socket, these are the filed down remains of the runner's and risers from the casting process. The edge of the aperture is surrounded by a thick tapering collar that has a semi-circular loop that projecting from one side in a low arch to join onto the side of the axe. On both faces are three long and pronounced straight ribs with tapering terminals that emanate from the base of the collar. The sides of the axe are flat with a pronounced ridge running down the centre which is the remains of the casting seam. Towards the tip the side curve outwards to the curved blade on the forward edge, which has a heavily corroded forward edge. Deep striations run across the whole of the blade and maybe evidence of sharpening.\n\nLength 90mm, width 53mm, thickness 41mm, weight 228g\n\n\n\nItem 3\n\nA fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe that consists of the blade and the base of the socket. The break is ancient and irregular. The blade has a very low curved forward edge which is heavily corroded. Behind the blade the surface of the axe is in excellent condition with a dark green patina that has a series of shallow striation that run up from the blade on the top and bottom edge that are probably formed from use or sharpening. The casting seam is visible but has been filed down. The socket at the rear is oval 31mm long by 10mm wide and 9mm deep\n\nLength 34mm, width 53mm, thickness 18mm, weight 87g\n\n\n\nItem 4\n\nA copper alloy socketed knife. The socket is oval in cross-section with an internal appetite of 18x10. The socket is sub-rectangular with slightly concave sides creating a narrowed waist. A single large rivet hole is situated towards the rear for attachment. The blade is 100mm long with slightly convex sides that narrow to a wide point at the tip. The face on both side of the blade is flat with long bevelled edges that form the cutting edge. The blade is snapped in two 1/3 up from the socket and although there is mud in the break, this section only show slight signs of corrosion with a bare metal evident over most of the exposed surface. Therefore, although this break is not recent it is still fairly modern meaning that this knife was complete when it was lost/buried and was broken post deposition.\n\n\n\n~~Length 130mm, width 22mm, thickness 13mm, weight 45g","fourFigureLat":"51.83136335","fourFigureLon":"-2.72699044","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"May 14, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"4","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Monmouth","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO9F6EB44.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
