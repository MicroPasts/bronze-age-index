The mouth of the socket is square with a thick exterior beaded collar around it. The body of the blade tapers from the mouth towards the blade in one plane, whilst it flares in the other into a curved, crescentic cutting edge. At one side, below the collar, is a large side loop on the longitudinal axis. The loop is D-shaped with an oval aperture. There are clear casting lines along the sides of the axehead. The sides of the body have two longitudinal facets flanking the casting ridges, giving the body an irregular hexagonal exterior profile. On one side (the one without the loop) there is pitting on the surface, perhaps as the result of slight mis-casting.\n\nDate: Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age - c. 1000 - 700 BC\n\nDimensions: 81.05 mm x 47.98 mm x 30.10 mm\n\nSocket dimensions: external 30.10 mm x 31.99 mm, internal 23.41 mm x 22.73 mm\n\nWeight: 107.21 g","fourFigureLat":"50.80846486","fourFigureLon":"-2.14329166","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Spetisbury","county":"Dorset","district":"North Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucybev/DORDD256B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"81.05"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
