One axe is complete and the other is in two pieces and is decorated.\n\n\n\nDescriptive catalogue:\n\n\n\n1. A copper alloy flat axe which is in two parts; it seems likely that this object has broken while in the ground and the break is not an example of pre-depositional action. The surfaces of the break are covered with comparable patina to the other surfaces of the object and both pieces fit neatly together.\n\n\n\nThe upper portion of the blade has a damaged butt, which is now uneven with one corner broken off, creating a diagonal butt. The sides widen slightly towards the break, which is approximately halfway between the butt and the cutting-edge. The lower portion of the blade consists of the cutting-edge, which is worn and one blade tip, the other is missing due to old breaks. The rounded nature of the side with the missing blade tip possibly conveys that after the break, the blade was re-sharpened to create a new working cutting-edge.\n\n\n\nOne face of the axe is flatter than the other, which is slightly convex. One side of the axe is also noticeably thicker than the other, this feature alongside the broken blade tip are possible indicators of how the axe was hafted, with the narrower side forming the lower edge after hafting. One side has been hammered to create slight flanges; this is only visible on the flatter face as this surface is less corroded. This face also has discernible decoration, consisting of straight vertical punched lines ('Rain pattern') on both the upper and lower portions of the blade. It is possible that the other face and the sides of the axe may also have been decorated, however the evidence of this has been lost due to corrosion.\n\n\n\nOverall the axe is corroded and is entirely covered with dark brown patina with areas of green and mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion, particularly on one face.\n\n\n\nDimensions:  Max. Length: 106.8 mm, Width at cutting-edge: 51.8 mm, Width at butt: 19.0 mm, Max. Thickness: 10.4 mm; Weight: 172g.\n\n\n\n2. A largely complete copper alloy flat axe. The butt is worn and appears to be slightly damaged; with one squared corner remaining. The sides in the upper half are almost parallel, widening gradually in the lower half to form a narrow cutting-edge. There is a slight stop-ridge across the thickest section of the blade, approximately halfway between the butt and the cutting-edge. The sides form slight flanges, creating dished faces.\n\n\n\nBoth blade tips are missing due to old breaks and the cutting-edge is very worn and corroded. Overall one face is less corroded than the other and both are covered with dark brown patina with small areas of green corrosion, particularly noticeable along the sides of the axe. All surfaces have mounds and pits of corrosion.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Max. Length: 192.2 mm, Max. Width at cutting-edge: 52.0 mm, Max. Width at butt: 23.3 mm, Max. Thickness: 11.9 mm; Weight: 242 g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: \n\n\n\nBoth the objects are corroded and missing several key diagnostic features, notably the butt and the blade tips of both objects but key diagnostic features are present, particularly the flanged sides and slight stop-ridge visible on flat axe No. 2. Both objects could be attributed to several possible types; Type Glenalla, Falkland or Bandon, these types are very similar and share common features (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61-68), although the size and the protruding blade tip of axe No.1 are consistent with Type Bandon. These types date to Stage IV or V of Needham's (1996) Metalwork Assemblage scheme (c.2050-1700 cal. BC) and are comparable to several axes found in a hoard of five axes from Wold Farm, Willerby, East Yorkshire, several of which are decorated (Burgess & Schmidt 1981, no. 326-8 & 337, pl. 134; Needham et al. 1985, BBAM Series A, no.5; Rohl & Needham 1998, fig.26, 125). The Silsden find falls within a group of Yorkshire flat axe hoards of MA IV/V noted by Needham (1988, fig. 2)\n\n\n\nAdditional information on context of discovery: \n\n\n\nIn subsequent correspondence (between the 3rd and 4th of December 2014) regarding the relative positions of the axes, [the finder (name redacted)] noted that flat axe No. 1 was the first to be recovered, that the 'axes were deep' and that they 'were in direct contact [with] no space between them'. A sketch and description provided shows the two axes placed side by side but 'kind of overlapping', No. 1 over No. 2, with the blades facing in opposite directions.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S. 1988.
