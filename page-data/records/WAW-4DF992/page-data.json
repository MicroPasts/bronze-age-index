The fragment is the tip of the spearhead. The fragment is sub-triangular in plan, with a sub-lozenge shaped section. The lower edge is a broeak, but it is not a recent break. The edges of the blade are abraded and blunt  having lost their original blade edge. The surface of the spearhead has areas of a well developed dark brown shiny patina, otherwise the spearhead is abraded. The spear measures 28.07mm long, 12.26mm wide and 7.88mm thick. It weighs 5.1g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patina, and shape in section suggests the spearhead dates to the  Bronze Age. However, as the majority of the object is missing, which has  the diagnostic features such as side-loops, the dating cannot be  narrowed down further.","fourFigureLat":"52.066511","fourFigureLon":"-1.549192","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"March 10, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.88","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-4DF992.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"28.07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
