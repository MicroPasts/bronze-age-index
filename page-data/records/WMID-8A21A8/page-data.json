The butt and shoulders of the dirk are incomplete with the top completely missing. One rivet holes is partially visible to one side, although two rivets would have been originally visible to the left and right when the artefact was complete. The sides of the blade below the shoulders curve/ taper inwards to start form the blade, where the slightly bevelled edges are still visible on both sides of the artefact. The dirk breaks prematurely at the opposing end, although the artefact would not have continued in length for much longer when complete. Overall, the dirk is in a worn, corroded and pitted condition with a patchy dark green patina. There are numerous pits on the patina all over the artefact and much of the corrosion is present at the blade edges and broken tip.\n\n\nSimilar dirks are illustrated in Savory, H, N, 1980, 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections' in the National Museum of Wales, pages 113 & 176, fig 28, ref nos 243-4, found at Llanfair Clydogau, Wales and Newchurch, North Wales respectively.\n\n\nOther examples are illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', page 10, ref nos 82-3, found at Middlesex, Thames and in Kent at the Isle of Thanet respectively.","fourFigureLat":"52.714165","fourFigureLon":"-2.341903","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"May 12, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sheriffhales","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-8A21A8.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"92"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
