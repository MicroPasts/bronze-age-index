The spearhead has a flame-shaped blade with a stepped, bevelled edge cast into the blade. It has two cast peg holes through the centre of its socket which is conical. As the socket tapers, it forms the midrib.\n\n\n\nThe rim of the socket is broken; an old break, possibly caused by the 'ritual killing' of the spear (a common practice in the Bronze Age). The edge of the blade has suffered some erosion and there is a small dent in the midrib, but otherwise the spearhead is in perfect condition. It has a smooth, shiny, dark green patina. There is no evidence on the object to suggest that spear was used prior to deposition.\n\n\n\nThe shape of the spearhead fits into Richard Davis' Class 11a (2015) and dates to the period c.1100-c.800 BC. However, this type of spearhead arrived later in Nottinghamshire and is more likely to date to c.900-c.800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.15142036","fourFigureLon":"-1.05941975","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alastair Willis","datefound1":"December 01, 2015","datefound2":"January 31, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by a museum - not a Treasure case","recorder":"Alastair Willis","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rufford","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Newark and Sherwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENOF70BF6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"172"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
