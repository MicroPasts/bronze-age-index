In plan the artefacts is sub-rectangular with an asymmetrical convex lower edge which tapers towards one terminal. All edges are broken and abraded edges, but this does not appear to be recent. In section the artefact is sub-rectangular with a slight convex plane on the lateral edges. The surface has pitting and a dark green heavy patina. It measures 53.61mm long, 19.89mm wide and 3.79mm thick. It weighs 15.6g.\n\n\nThe function of the object is not known. It is not likely to be a dagger or rapier or such like as the cross section does not have a central rib or tapering cutting edges. The condition of the metal and its' surface does suggest a probable Bronze Age date (-2150 - -800).","fourFigureLat":"52.193237","fourFigureLon":"-2.016047","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2012","datefound2":"June 10, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.79","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kington","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-742B74.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"53.61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
