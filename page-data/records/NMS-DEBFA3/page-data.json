At the probable mid-point there are opposed rectangular projections on both sides forming a collar or stop ridge. One end  is broken just beyond the collar and comprises a rectangular-sectioned stump. The other end of the awl is of faceted recatgular section and  tapers to a sharp point. The metal has a dark green patina. Surviving length 54mm.  Width at shoulders 14mm. Width at springing of both 7mm. 6.5mm  thick. Weighs 11.58g.
