It consists of the moulding at the mouth of the socket and the upper edges of the ribs on the body. The side loop and rest of the mouth and body are missing. The thick moulded collar with a moulded raised parellel ridge below it and multiple ribs, coming off at right angles from the ridge, suggest that this is a Llyn Fawr or Sompting-type axe. The moulding is sub-square in plan, curving at one edge, at the begining of one corner. There are 4 ends of the ribs present, suggesting that the whole face of the axe would have had about 6 to 7 ribs altogether. Late Bronze Age Rohl & Needham (1998) illustrate a similar Llyn Fawr Sompting-type axe with fewer ribs on page 138, Fig.40, No.405, which is dated to c.800-650 BC. Other examples of socketed axes with multiple ribs can be found in the hoard from Figheldean in Wiltshire, in the British Museum's collections (see Burgess and Coombs, Bronze Age Hoards: some finds old and new, British Archaeological Reports 67).","fourFigureLat":"50.191633","fourFigureLon":"-5.41985","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"April 04, 2007","datefound2":"April 22, 2007","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hayle","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Julyfinds 030.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"23"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
