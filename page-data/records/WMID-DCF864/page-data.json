The fragment is sub-rectuangular in plan and elongated lozenge-shaped in cross-section. The central mid-rib is defined on either side of the rib by a vertical line, occurring on both faces, before tapering towards the cutting edges. The cutting edges show signs of wear. The fragment is terminated by worn breaks at the top and bottom of the blade. The object has a dark green patina. \n\n\n\nThe overall dimensions are as follows: 27.83mm in length, 37.58mm in width, 7.06mm in thickness and 26.15g in weight. \n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nSimilar examples recorded on the PAS database include: BERK-CCF74B; NMGW-FE5523; and BERK-CF2C22. \n\n\n\nOwing to the size of the fragment it in unclear what type of blade this object was attributed to and how long the original item would have been. However, as Domscheit (2014) discusses, 'Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered'.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nDomscheit, W (2014) NMGW-FE5523: A BRONZE AGE BLADE\n\n\n\nWeb page available at: https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/643045\n\n\n\n[Accessed: 10 Oct 2018 11:00:54]","fourFigureLat":"50.92945493","fourFigureLon":"-0.91993923","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.06","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Compton","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sburford/WMIDDCF864.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"27.83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
