The axe is sub-rectangular in plan, the edges curving out at both the butt and blade end. The axe is triangular in profile. There is a moulded lip around the socket opening. The shape of the opening is unclear from the images, however it is probably rectangular with rounded corners. The axe is damaged at the socketed opening, with just under half of the moulding missing. This break extends down one edge and face of the axe. It is unclear how old these breaks are. A semi-circular loop, with central sub-circular opening is located just below the moulding on the unbroken edge of the axe. The blade end is curved, and the cutting edge shows signs of damage making the cutting edge appear almost straight for two thirds of its length. Both faces are plain and undecorated, there is no trace of moulding on either surface. The surface of the axe is pitted and corroded. It is a dull green colour, with a small amount of copper-brown patina showing though. The axe is 88mm long, 35mm wide and 57mm thick. The weight is unknown.","fourFigureLat":"51.828991","fourFigureLon":"0.305971","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Not seen by FLO.
