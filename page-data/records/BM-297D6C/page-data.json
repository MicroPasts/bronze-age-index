Three have been reported as potential Treasure; the fourth, made by a different finder, should also be submitted for consideration. The three submitted were located at depths between 1 and 4 inches (2.5 &ndash; 10 cm) on cultivated land. They were found in an approximate line at intervals of about 25 feet (8 m) &ndash; hence 50 feet overall. The alignment was noted to be that of the direction of ploughing.\n\nDescriptions: Condition of the palstaves (nos 1 &amp; 2) is good, the socketed axe, less so. Deep green to blackish patinas are largely intact, but there is scattered pock-scarring.\n\n1. Looped palstave: Patina intact over part of butt and much of flange crests; cutting edge and blade tips totally corrosion chipped. Flanges triangular; stop projects beyond a little and has convex-profiled underside. Stout trident-rib motif &ndash; the outer ribs slightly bowed and point of convergence low on blade; stem below is diffuse. Strong edge bevel with slight blade tip hollows. Hammer-dimpling on faces and sides.\n\nExtant length 154 mm ; extant width cutting edge 51.7 mm; breadth at stop 36.8 mm; width butt 24.5 mm; thickness septum base 12 mm; thickness edge bevel 12 mm; depth edge bevel 18 mm; weight 485.5 g\n\n2. Looped palstave: Butt corner intact &ndash; adjacent notch may be due to poor casting. Two flanges intact, two corrosion damaged. Stretch of cutting edge retains patina, but is rounded rather than sharp. Flanges convex-triangular in shape; stop projects beyond a little and has convex-profiled underside. Stout trident-rib motif &ndash; the outer ribs slightly bowed. Strong edge bevel, hammering having caused blade tip hollows; however, tips have then been neatly squared off in finishing. Some hammer rippling, especially on edge bevel.\n\nExtant length 149.5 mm; width cutting edge 47.8 mm; width butt 24.5 mm; breadth at stop 32 mm; thickness septum base 11.5 mm; thickness edge bevel 12.8 mm; depth edge bevel 11 mm; weight 418.8 g\n\n3. Socketed axe: Half of one face and of one side missing - ?eaten away by corrosion. Cutting edge and blade tips totally corrosion chipped. Flat deep mouth-moulding. Corroded lump on one side of moulding, 4 mm across, likely to be stump of a loop. Both faces and sides have convex profile, but they still meet at well defined body angles. Intact side shows light linear features parallel to fine central casting flash remnant. Inner edge of mouth top also carries thin casting flash. Diffuse edge bevel. Socket tapers steadily and asymmetrically to wedge-like end.\n\nExtant length 111 mm; extant width cutting edge 37.6 mm; extant width mouth 33.8 mm; breadth mouth 29.5 mm; depth socket 79 mm; weight 217.9 g.\n\nDiscussion:&nbsp;Of the three submitted objects, the two palstaves are of the Transitional type typical of the Penard metalworking assemblage, circa 1275 &ndash; 1150 BC. The socketed axe is an early flat-collar form; it does not have the gracile proportions of the Taunton-Hademarschen axes and instead is entirely in keeping with Penard socketed axe styles. A good parallel may be found, for example, in the Wallington hoard, Northumberland (Burgess 1968, 13 fig. 9.14), now datable to the Penard phase.\n\nThe three reported bronzes can therefore be attributed to the same phase of the Bronze Age and could well have been deposited at the same time. Although well separated, their linear alignment admits the possibility that they were plough dispersed from close proximity to one another.","fourFigureLat":"52.95647202","fourFigureLon":"0.57396722","fromdate":"-1275","todate":"-1150","notes":"It is likely that the objects form a single find of Middle&nbsp;Bronze Age&nbsp;date, which&nbsp;qualifies the group&nbsp;as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"September 01, 2004","datefound2":"September 30, 2004","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"3","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thornham","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mrainbow/00064445_001.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
