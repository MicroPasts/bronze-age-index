BC 1600-1400). The palstave is near-complete with only part of the broken butt missing. The palstave is roughly sub-rectangular in shape and flattens and flares outwards to form a wide rounded blade, giving the object a slender elongated sub-oval shaped cross-section. The butt is H-shaped in section and terminates towards the centre of the axe with shallow rounded stop-ridge and a peltate-shaped recess on both sides at right angles to the septum. The flanges are flat, sub-oval in plan, straight and parallel and extend all the way to the butt, with a central longitudinal casting ridge, one with a flattened globular miscast patch towards the cutting edge. The blade gradually flattens and to form a wide cutting edge that is heavily worn and pitted. One side of the blade is heavily pitted and scratched and has patches of green patina and iron-corrosion across sections of the flange and especially the recessed section of the butt. The opposite side of the axe is less corroded but has a wide diagonal scratch extending from the cutting edge to the adjacent flange.\n\n\n\nThe palstave axe measures 142mm in length. The blade is 61mm wide and 2mm thick at the cutting edge and the butt 22mm wide and 10mm thick and its end, and 22mm wide and 26mm thick at the stop. The axe weighs 325.13 grams.\n\n\n\nThis palstave shares characteristics with Group 1 Primary Shield Pattern palstaves from the Acton Park 1 of Bronze Age metalwork (as of Schmidt & Burgess 1981).\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981.
