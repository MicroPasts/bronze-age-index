The blade has a rounded lozenge-shaped cross-section; it tapers towards the point and gently curves longitudinally in an arc.  The broken edge has the same patchy mid green patina as the rest of the surface suggesting the damage occurred in antiquity.  Sickles have been found in Somerset hoards such as the Monkswood hoard and the Sparkford Hill hoard that are dated to the middle Bronze Age (Smith 1959:42,46).   Smith (1959:46) notes that sickles are attributable to influences from the Nordic Bronze Age (and further west in Europe).  Dimensions: length: 79.51mm; width: 14.13mm; thickness: 2.11mm; weight: 9.53g.  Reference: Smith, M.A. 1959. Middle Bronze Age Hoards from Southern England.
