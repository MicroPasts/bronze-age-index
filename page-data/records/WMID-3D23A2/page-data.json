Raised flanges are present along the edges of both sides of the axehead each showing signs of heavy wear. No casting flashes are visible. No sign of a proto stop.\n\n\n\nIt measures 103.0 mm long, 28.2 mm wide at the blade, 16.5 mm wide at the butt end. 7.2 mm thick in the centre, 11.0 mm thick including the flanges. It weighs 91.78 g. The flanges are 52.7 mm long, extending from the butt end to midway along the body. They extend a maximum of 2.4 mm above the body.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. The surface is heavily pitted, either as a result of poor casting or due to soil conditions whilst buried.\n\n\n\nSimilar flanged axeheads have been recorded on the PAS database, including: YORYM-D5C7D6. The lack of a proto stop ridge is suggestive that this flanged axehead may fall within the Acton Park I phase, possibly dating to between c. 1600 BC to c. 1400 BC. However due to the surface condition, it is hard to confirm.","fourFigureLat":"52.75957418","fourFigureLon":"-1.91253021","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mavesyn Ridware","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID3D23A2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"103"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
