The arrowhead flares out gently from the base and narrows towards the tip forming a \"leaf-shape\" when viewed in plan.  On both the face and reverse, a central rib extends from the base towards the tip, although its presence is uncertain at the tip due to material loss. The metal narrows to form lateral blades either side of the central rib, although the edges of the blades are missing, making the original shape uncertain. The tip is missing, leaving a rough, rounded end to the object.  The base includes a circular blind socket which extends about 15mm into the object. The arrowhead appears to be solid. \n\n\n\nThe metal surface is mostly dark green with some small raised patches of mid-brown material which are likely to be soil or a corrosion product or a coating.  A large proportion of the surface is smooth, appearing to be original, but approximately 20% of this surface has been lost to corrosion or physical damage, leaving a rough surface.  The base is broken through the socket so it is likely that part of the length is missing. The break surface is rough and has a similar green surface patina to the rest of the object. The break reveals the roughness of the casting, with two sub-spherical cavities in the region of the junction of the blades with the material surrounding the socket, which are probably bubbles from casting process.\n\n \n\n\n\nWMID-28FC66 describes a similar object and states that \"Bronze arrowheads dating to this period are extremely rare in Britain, with one found as part of a hoard in Penard, Wales (Savory, 1980, 57) as well as possible arrowheads found on the Isle of Portland, Sussex, Yorkshire, Montgomeryshire and another on display in Norwich Museum. Bronze arrowheads seem to appear more regularly in France where they were first manufactured in the Middle Bronze Age, in the Paris basin and the west-central area (Savory, 57).\"\n\n\n\nSimilar objects are described in SUSS-5DC319, SWYOR-19E2B1, SWYOR-C57356 and WMID-3AE711.  These appear to mostly date to the late Bronze Age.  Although arrowheads are described as very rare finds, this example does appear to be very small for a spearhead.  Although the edges, base and tip are missing and therefore original size cannot be determined, the shape appears to taper inward towards the base and so it is unlikely that the socket diameter is much bigger than the 4.76mm measured.  This indicates that the shaft of the original weapon would be narrow and relatively weak for a spear, unless made for a child or ceremonial purpose.","fourFigureLat":"54.1385207","fourFigureLon":"-0.86882534","fromdate":"1000","todate":"800","notes":"This object was partly recorded during the Covid19 crisis.
