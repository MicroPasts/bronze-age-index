The pin has a dark brown patina with small green surface pits caused by corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe pin has broken across its projecting loop and the lower part of the shaft is missing. There is a casting void visible in the break. The pin has a swelling shaft which is extensively decorated; five groups of bands encircle the shaft in the order 5,4,5,6, 6 with the band of five being closest to the head of the pin and the band of six at the break in the shaft. In three instances the space between two individual grooves is infilled with transverse nicks (or short straight lines). The wider space left between the band of five and the band of six is infilled with a closely-spaced diamond lattice of grooves. The shaft of the pin widens and splays as it meets the flat circular (24.75mm diameter) back of the head of the pin which is extensively covered with abrasions caused by grinding.\n\n\n\nOn the outer face of the circular head is a cylindrical projection with a dished interior; this is presumably intended for a missing setting, perhaps of amber. Around this cylinder is a circle of fourteen truncated cones which project a little beyond the central cylinder.\n\n\n\nThis highly unusual pin has no close parallels.","fourFigureLat":"51.73362473","fourFigureLon":"-1.49458822","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"September 24, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"24.75","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aston, Cote, Shifford and Chimney","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/B16944.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"74.85"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
