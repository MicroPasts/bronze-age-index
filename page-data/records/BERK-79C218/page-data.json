The axe has a square sectioned socket with a depth of 59.57mm. The mouth has three moulded transverse ribs; below these ribs there is a single side loop. The side loop is located 12.40mm from the mouth of the socket, the external width of the loop is: 17.17mm, internal width: 5.51mm. Just below the side loop, on the socket, there are two oval depressions, one on each side of the socket. These oval depressions extend partially around the front and reverse surfaces. After the depressions the blade starts and it is clearly defined by a step down from the socket. The blade has a crisp rectangular cross-section and it gently expands towards the curved cutting edge (width from: 28.35mm expanding to 37.17mm). There are visible hammer marks on the surface of the blade and the hammering has created a clear bevel at the cutting edge. There are some edge losses to the cutting edge and one corner is missing, however this may be post depositional damage. There are some casting flashes remaining around the mouth of the socket and along the sides. There are no internal ribs on the socket. The copper alloy has a dark brown patina. Dimensions: length: 97.47mm; width: 37.00mm; thickness: 24.76mm; weight: 108.74g.","fourFigureLat":"51.63251236","fourFigureLon":"-1.12005536","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kate Sumnall","datefound1":"September 08, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Paula Levick","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Benson","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/plevick/Harmer - axe - Sept 06.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"97.47"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
