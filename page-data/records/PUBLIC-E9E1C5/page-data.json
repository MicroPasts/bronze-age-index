The centre is constricted and plain, and has a deep sub-circular recess on the inside of the curve. On each 'wing', there are incised grooves running lengthwise for a little under half the total length. The ends are plain and taper to slender blunt points, one of which has lost its tip. A comparable scabbard chape can be found illustrated in Smith (1925, 75; fig. 67).","fourFigureLat":"51.64300721","fourFigureLon":"-1.35107986","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-200","notes":"These objects, of which only a few are known from Britain, are all distinctly moustache shaped, but some are of more 'droopy' appearance than others.
