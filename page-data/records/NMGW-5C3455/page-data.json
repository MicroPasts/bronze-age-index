The socket mouth is circular and incomplete, with a little over half remaining (with a diameter of 33.0mm). Below the socket, the mouth is concave (for 11mm) before a moulding, producing the characteristic 'trumpet-shaped collar'. The loop springs from below the moulding (with a length of 21mm) and has been distorted with a blow to its midpoint, producing an undulating form. The looped side is more complete and is concave across its length, expanding towards the missing blade (with a maximum surviving width 28.0mm and a width below the loop of 25.5mm). The casting seam is evident running along the preserved side and has been finished. The body of the axe has a number of facets, seemingly twelve, which characterise the axe type. The blade of the axe appears to have been removed and significant battering above the break has closed the socket at the break (giving a thickness at the break of 11.8mm). The mouth has also received a blow, causing a part of the body to be folded into the socket. The split continues to the break at the base and has also received a significant blow above the blade. The surface is corroded and worn with a light-brown corrosion overlying a black patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.40090601","fourFigureLon":"-3.53955461","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"The axe demonstrates clear evidence of deliberate damage, apparently to the mouth, the loop in addition to the faces and sides of the blade. Faceted axes have been recorded from a Late Wilburton hoard in Co. Roscommon, indicating a possible date for the type from the transition of the Wilburton-Wallington and Ewart Park metalworking phases.\n\n\n\n1.
