The tang (48mm length) is of square section, which diverges towards the prominent shoulder moulding or 'collar'. At the collar the chisel has a width of 12.3mm, thickness of 8.8mm. The collar moulding has a length of 6mm, converges towards the blade and appears to be slightly concave along its length. The sides of the blade are concave producing an expanded blade edge with a surviving width of 28.2mm. The chisel has a mid-brown patina with some surface survival. Some surface striations are evident on one face and running at an angle across the blade, it is unclear whether the striations are the result of sharpening.","fourFigureLat":"51.550017","fourFigureLon":"-3.068632","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).\n\n\n\nTanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt 'C' sword.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"June 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coedkernew","county":"Newport","district":"Newport","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.130.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"85.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
