Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face and base of the ingot are smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and the sides of the fragment have ridges and cavities typically seen in the sections of these bun ingots.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, PLate 36, Nos.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork, and an ingot fragment from Churston Ferrers, Torbay on page 457, Plate 40, No.306b, which was found with a larger plano-convex ingot.","fourFigureLat":"51.19550078","fourFigureLon":"1.23327042","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Emma Youell","datefound1":"October 19, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Emma Youell","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"36.01","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eythorne","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ehmahh/bronzebun.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
