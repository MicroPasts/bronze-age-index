This fragment represents part of the expanded blade end of the axe. It is trapezoidal in plan and wedge shaped in profile. The original cutting edge no longer exists and the blade tips are heavily worn. There is a ‘V’ shaped depression in the broad end of the fragment that is subrectangular when viewed in plan, which represents the very end of the socket. The axe surface is heavily abraded and pitted. The original surface of the axe only survives in small patches and is dark brown in patina. The subsequently exposed surface is bright green, with areas of deeper pitting being yellowy in colour. The depression has a light brown patina to its sides. The fragment survives in generally poor condition. The fragment is 20.04mm long, 35.3mm wide, 11.02mm thick at the broad end and weighs 18.03g.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rochford","county":"Essex","district":"Rochford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/DSCN1569.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"20.04"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
