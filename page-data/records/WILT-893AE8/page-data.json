It consists of a small fragment of the hilt, with the remnants of two rivet holes, with apparently most of the blade. It is sub lense shaped in cross section, with a slightly emphasised central rib on both sides of the blade and tear drop shape in form, tapering to a rounded point. It is difficult to be certain how much, if any, of the blade is missing. It is 67.88mm in length, 28.00mm in width at its widest and weighs 13.55g.The surface has a dark green patina and shows abraded patches. This dagger is perhaps typical of the Penard phase of the Bronze Age (1275 BC to c. 1140 BC). It is very similar to a Grp III rapier, or more likely, a dirk.\n\n\n\nA similar item can be seen at - WMID-D54E37","fourFigureLat":"51.11416319","fourFigureLon":"-2.17280853","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Hanbidge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Hanbidge","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.56","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Deverill","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT893AE8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"67.88"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
