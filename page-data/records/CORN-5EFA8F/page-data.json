Both faces of the axe are decorated with rows of incised chevrons, from the edge of the butt end of the axe, running for a length of 51 mm. Below these, from the middle of the axe to the edge of the blade are six fanned ridges that have been hammered onto the axe after casting, and are about 60 mm in length, and about 8 mm apart. Below the decoration, the blade has been hammered and bevelled. The edge of the blade is damaged and parts of the surface are pitted with corrosion, but the dark green patina survives well and the axe has been treated and lacquered in the past so that it is now stable. Flat axes decorated with chevrons and with expanded blades can be found during the Mile Cross-Aylesford phase (c.2000-1900 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 4B axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 124, fig.25, no.46).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a flat axe with similar hammered ribs and incised lozenges from Read in plate 27, no.317, which is classified as a Type Aylesford developed flat axe and dated from the Aylesford metalwork phase (c.2000-1900 BC).\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a flat axe with incised zigzag patterns on both faces and raised flanges, from Weston-Super-Mare in Somerset, on pages 71 & 87, pl.14, no.448.\n\n\n\nThe Aylesford Phase is now dated from c.1950-1875 BC (Roberts et al. 2013, p.23, fig.2.2).","fourFigureLat":"53.99896983","fourFigureLon":"-0.4454405","fromdate":"-1950","todate":"-1875","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"January 01, 1997","datefound2":"December 31, 1997","subsequentActionTerm":"In a private collection, recorded for academic use","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Driffield","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June16finds175.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"128"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
