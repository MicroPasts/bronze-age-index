The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib.&nbsp;The midrib is damaged on one side. The cutting edge is incomplete and is bevelled. There doesn&#39;t appear to be evidence of use or sharpening on the surface.&nbsp;\n\nThe tip part measures 46.5 mm&nbsp;in length and is 15.4&nbsp;mm&nbsp;wide at base and 4.2 mm&nbsp;wide at tip. It has a thickness of 7.7&nbsp;mm&nbsp;and weighs 16.5 g.\n\nThe lower&nbsp;part measures 49.5 mm&nbsp;in length and is 16.7 mm&nbsp;wide at top and 29.2 mm&nbsp;wide at base. It has a thickness of 10.2 mm&nbsp;and weighs 26.3&nbsp;g.\n\nThe total length of the object is 94 mm. The maximum width is 29.2 mm&nbsp;and the maximum thickness is 10.2 mm. The total weight of the spear is 42.8 g.\n\nThe object is a mid to dark green&nbsp;in colour with an even surface&nbsp;patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail and some damage to the object.\n\nThis object probably corresponds with examples from metal working phase I or II of the Late Bronze Age.
