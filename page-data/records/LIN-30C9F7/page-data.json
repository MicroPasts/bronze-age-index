Two elongated socket loops at the side of the shaft, circa 20mm below the wings.  The shaft is broken at the base.  Only the lower part of the wings remain, and they appear to be leaf-shaped.  Side looped spearheads are thought to date to the early to middle Middle Bronze Age, although only a few examples have so far been found in context.
