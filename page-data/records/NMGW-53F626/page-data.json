The palstave is of the Penard metalworking tradition, falling into the later part of Needham's (1996) Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150BC). Characteristically for the type, the palstave is slender with a narrow blade, low-flanges and was looped (now broken). The butt is slightly angled and is irregular, possibly through damage. The septum is concave and the stop is straight with right angles to the flanges. The sides are straight and parallel above the stop and the flanges are rounded, forming an elipse with the blade faces. Uncharacteristically for the type, the flanges reach their apex before the stop; this variation in the flange line may be seen as an influence of later (Irish) or earlier (primary / low-flanged) palstaves. The blade sides are subtly curved and gradually diverge to an unexpanded edge, resulting in weak blade corners. The blade edge is only slightly rounded. The blade faces are convex near the stop and are decorated with a weak midrib or ridge. There is no discernible blade facet. The casting seams are visible on the sides, and have been neatly finished.","fourFigureLat":"52.836342","fourFigureLon":"1.086578","fromdate":"-1350","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Briston","county":"Norfolk","district":"North Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2271.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"139"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
