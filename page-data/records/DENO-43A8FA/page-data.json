The object is bifacial and narrowly convex, with no central midrib. The object is roughly trapezoidal when laid flat and roughly triangular in profile. The socket is waisted and a pointed oval in cross-section, with no visible peg-holes. There is a triangular facet down one side; the other side may also have been faceted but is now too worn to discern. The rim of the socket has a rough, uneven edge where it terminates in an ancient break. The interior of the object is encrusted with dirt from the end of the waist. Both faces are smooth and have a brown patina. The edge and the socket on one face have a rough, green surface where the outer layer has been worn away. Overall the object measures 46.54mm long, 25.56mm wide and 9.81mm thick. It weighs 17.41g.","fourFigureLat":"53.14986872","fourFigureLon":"-0.88001897","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sophie Mander","datefound1":"June 08, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sophie Mander","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.81","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norwell","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Newark and Sherwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENO43A8FA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"46.54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
