The tip is missing as is the majority of the lower portion. The socket, if there was one, is not visible. In plan the fragment is a sub-triangular shape with a rounded tip and heavily abraded edges. The lower edge is broken, probably quite recently as the patina does not cover this area. In cross section the spearhead is a sub-lozenge shape, however one edge is very abraded. The original existing edge is also slightly more angled forming a shape edge. The patination is heavy and a dark green colour.","fourFigureLat":"52.6516408","fourFigureLon":"-1.85361831","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"January 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wall","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
