Sub-triangular in plan with the corners of the widest end radiused to a curve, with the opposite end terminating in a sharp point. The mid-section of the sides are symmetrically chamfered. Two thirds of the way towards the pointed end, on one face only, is a blind circular hole. It is unclear if this is by design or a defect from the casting process. The form is very reminiscent of a miniature un-hafted axehead coping an early Bronze Age flat axe. However, the sharp point, chamfered sides and rounded coroners at the blade end are atypical, but the cross-section is classically lenticular for an axehead and the degree of corrosion and patination are commensurate with an early date. Miniature axeheads similar to this object can be seen at NARC-B0797B and YORYM-F02231 on the PAS database. However, on account of the aforementioned atypical features the identity is not conclusive. For example if the sharp end of this object was a worn break it could have originally continued to a loop and perhaps functioned as a hanger in a harness pendant. There is scant evidence for being more definitive.  Diminutive axeheads are often assigned a Roman date, but those copying earlier Bronze Age types are also thought by some scholars to be of their own period.  \n\n\n\nA record of a miniature axehead that also has a Bronze Age form (see ESS-819206), when contrasting them with diminutive axeheads found in the Roman period, concludes a preference for the BA type having a ritual use in the Bronze Age, and mentions that other examples of diminutive axes \"can also be seen in Needham (unpublished; figures 77, 82 and 91). Other examples can also be seen in Needham 1988, 'Selective deposition in the British Early Bronze Age', World Archaeology, volume 20, number 2, figure 4. These all illustrate the range in size and form of Bronze Age diminutive axes, enhancing the possibility that these objects are in fact of Bronze Age date.\" :\n\n\n\nOn the tentative assumption that this object is a miniature axehead a date range of Circa 1900BC-AD100 is suggested, to encompass both schools of thought.","fourFigureLat":"52.64494856","fourFigureLon":"0.42258164","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"March 01, 2020","datefound2":"January 01, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Runcton Holme","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/PFd_56023_F76975_INDTH03022022GC.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"40.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
