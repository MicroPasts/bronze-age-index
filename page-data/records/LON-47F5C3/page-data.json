This rapier has the characteristic thin narrow blade that expands to form a plate with rounded end and two rivet holes for attachment to the hilt.  There is a slight notch just below the rivet hole on each side.  The blade has a flattened, broad central mid rib.  The blade is bent so that it now forms a gentle curve when viewed in profile.  There are some notches along the cutting edges but these may be due to post depositional damage.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length:  380mm; width: 46.59mm; thickness: 5.88mm; diameterof rivet holes: 6.59mm; maximum width of blade: 24.48mm; weight: 380g.\n\n\n\nVery similar examples are reported in the middle Bronze Age hoards found at Taunton and Penard (Rohl & Needham 1998:129, 131) and also recorded on the PAS database e.g. BERK-6C30D2 and BUC-680280. \n\n\n\nReference: Rohl, B. and Needham, S. 1998.
