From this point is widens in a smooth concave curve to its point of maximum width and its blade tips (c.83mm). The blade is a shallow crescent shape and appears to have been bevelled on one side from sharpening. The opposite surface’s patina is too chipped to determine whether it too was sharpened or whether the blade has marks from use.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is lozenge shaped in profile thickening from its butt and blade to a proto stop bevel that is placed c.69mm down its length from the butt. The bevel is shallow but clearly visible.\n\n\n\nBoth surfaces of the axehead have traces of worn incised decoration. On both sides this consists of incised dashes placed in a zig zag lines running down the length of the blade creating a shallow transverse herring bone design. These lines fill the width of the body where they are placed. On the least damaged surface this pattern is visible from 43.6mm after the butt and ends 56mm before the blade. The opposite surface may have covered a similar extent but is too pitted, chipped and worn to be certain.\n\n\n\nThe axehead has a glossy light green, sometimes brown patina that is abraded and chipped in several places.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is 170mm long, 83mm wide, 12.8mm thick at the bevel and weighs 419 grams.\n\n\n\nThe dimensions of this axehead have been recorded following the protocol established by Needham (2017). The ratios of these dimensions match that of class 4C Type Mount Pleasant and whose depictions match the form of this example. This form is suggested to date to c.2000-1900 cal BC (Needham 2017: 26).","fourFigureLat":"51.86800279","fourFigureLon":"-1.39141916","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1900","notes":"Appendix 1: Measurements to Needham’s (2018) specifications and associated ratios\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nDimension\n\n\t\t\t\nL\n\n\t\t\t\nLB\n\n\t\t\t\nDE\n\n\t\t\t\nWB\n\n\t\t\t\nLC\n\n\t\t\t\nW2\n\n\t\t\t\nW3\n\n\t\t\t\nWE\n\n\t\t\t\nMO\n\n\t\t\t\nLC'\n\n\t\t\t\nMT\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nMeasurement\n\n\t\t\t\n170\n\n\t\t\t\n155\n\n\t\t\t\n15\n\n\t\t\t\n27\n\n\t\t\t\n142\n\n\t\t\t\n28\n\n\t\t\t\n55\n\n\t\t\t\n83\n\n\t\t\t\n10\n\n\t\t\t\n90\n\n\t\t\t\n12.8\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nRatio\n\n\t\t\t\nRWB\n\n\t\t\t\nRWB'\n\n\t\t\t\nRWE\n\n\t\t\t\nRDE\n\n\t\t\t\nEH\n\n\t\t\t\nRW3\n\n\t\t\t\nRMO\n\n\t\t\t\nASC\n\n\t\t\t\nMRW\n\n\t\t\t\nRBS\n\n\t\t\t\nRHF\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nCalculated value\n\n\t\t\t\n0.325301\n\n\t\t\t\n0.158824\n\n\t\t\t\n0.488235\n\n\t\t\t\n0.180723\n\n\t\t\t\n0.006452\n\n\t\t\t\n0.354839\n\n\t\t\t\n0.070423\n\n\t\t\t\n0.529412\n\n\t\t\t\n0.709677\n\n\t\t\t\n0.457143\n\n\t\t\t\n0","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"April 07, 2020","datefound2":"April 07, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Glympton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON4DDC19.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"170"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
