The object is a central section of a spear head and has a triangular form and a circular cross sectioned central rib which runs through the fragment, becoming narrower towards the top (as shown). The edges which emerge from this are badly damaged and the breaks appear ancient. Overall, the shape is consistent with a side-looped socketed spear head, but not enough of the object remains for definite identification. See also DENO-447EC6 and YORYM-564F27 for similar objects.","fourFigureLat":"52.76549412","fourFigureLon":"-1.14185879","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"March 25, 2017","datefound2":"July 05, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Elisabeth Janovsky","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walton on the Wolds","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Charnwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/LEICF6B444.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
