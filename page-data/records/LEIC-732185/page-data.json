The object is in a fair condition with a brown patina and weighs 9.04grams. The object is sub-rectangular in form and section and consists of a circular sectioned loop which has four semi-circular protrusions evenly spaced on its outer edge. Sitting above these on the face are four sub-spherical knops. Between two of these knops is a central cross bar formed in two parts. The lower part sits on the same plane as the circular loop, whilst the other sits above it, joining the sub-spherical knops together. This forms a rectangular recess which would have taken a strap.","fourFigureLat":"52.883501","fourFigureLon":"-1.317861","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"1066","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"December 31, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Breaston","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Erewash","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/732185a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
