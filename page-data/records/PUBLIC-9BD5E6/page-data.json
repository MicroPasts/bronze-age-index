The fragment suggests a comparatively small axe (with a surviving length of 47.7mm and a weight of 53.6g). The socket is sub-oval with straight, parallel ends (with a length of 27.0mm, a surviving width of 14.1mm and a maximum surviving depth of 32.8mm). The axe has a sub-hexagonal body section at the break (with a width at the break of 33.5mm and a maximum surviving thickness of 18.8mm). The casting flashes are evident and raised on both sides and appear to have been roughly finished by hammering. The sides are near parallel and only diverge slightly to the eroded blade tips (producing a surviving blade width of 38.2mm). The original blade edge does not survive and is comparatively straight. The blade faces are slightly convex across their widths and flat (but convergent) across their lengths with prominent blade facets discernible on both faces (c. 13mm from the present blade edge). There are now no ribs extending onto the blade fragment, although the surface loss on the upper part of the fragment may have irradiated the lower parts of any ribs. No sharpening striations are discernible on the blade edge where the surface survives. Some of the original surface survives with a dark brown patination, elsewhere there are areas of active bronze corrosion.\n\n\nThe blade fragment appears to be from a comparatively small axe, although the fragmentary nature makes the typological identification difficult. The hexagonal body section and crude finishing may suggest an axe of South Wales Type. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although this axe is likely to date to the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.640673","fourFigureLon":"-2.984055","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 29, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ponthir","county":"Torfaen","district":"Torfaen","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.26.1i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"47.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
