The body and blade is all that survives of the axehead. The mouth and loop are missing. Most of the original brown patina is damaged and only remains in patches on the back. The remaining light green surface is slightly pitted. The body of the axe is rectangular in plan with gently flaring sides that expand slightly into the lower blade and cutting edge. Most of the front face is missing, making the inside of the socket visible. Packed tightly inside the socket end are possibly the remains of a wooden shaft. \n  The surviving length is 87.0mm, the width midway down the body is 27.0mm and the maximum thickness is 20.2mm. The width from each blade tip is 35.0mm and the weight is 104.26g.","fourFigureLat":"53.382337","fourFigureLon":"-0.753653","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lisa Staves","datefound1":"April 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lisa Staves","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gainsborough","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lstaves/NLM09258.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"North Lincolnshire Museum","length":"87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
