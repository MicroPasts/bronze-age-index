In plan it is an inverted sub triangle. The sides are straight, tapering to a broken edge. The upper corners of the sides form a ‘)’ and ‘(‘ shape as it is broken across two rivet holes. The patina remains on the curvature of the rivet holes. Above the rivet holes the object is again broken. It is difficult to determine when the breaks occurred as almost all of the patina is missing on the fragment, except for a small patch on the hilt and rivet holes. The patina is a heavy mid brown colour.  \n\n\n \n The condition of the object is poor, it is only a fragment, and the surface is corroded. It measures 48.3mm long and 26.6mm wide. It weighs 15.28g.","fourFigureLat":"52.363897","fourFigureLon":"-2.192335","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"February 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chaddesley Corbett","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wyre Forest","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-BD9747.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"48.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
