Below it measures 17.5mm in diameter, narrowing to the relatively straight cutting edge which measures 13.9mm in width and 5.6mm in thickness. The back of the gouge is linearly faceted (eight faces) while the inverted-V shaped groove reaches from the cutting edge to just before the collar moulding.\nThe metal is a mid-green in colour with a greyish hue, presumably the result of a copper-tin alloy. The patina is smooth and shiny. The gouge measures 87.7mm in length, 19.9mm in max.width, 20.3 in max.thickness and diameter and weighs 65.96g.\nIt is likely that this tool is from the Wilburton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking phases which correspond to Needham's (1996) Period's 6 - 8.","fourFigureLat":"51.12326854","fourFigureLon":"-2.05853319","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-650","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"March 08, 2016","datefound2":"June 06, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20.3","edge":null,"thickness":"20.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stockton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPD11447.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"87.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
