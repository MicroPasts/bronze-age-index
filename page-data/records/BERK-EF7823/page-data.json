On close examination, the chape is formed from a single sheet of copper alloy, beaten and folded over to form the bulbus crescent shape. A section of the back has been lost in antiquity, the front, which remains intact, has three rivet fixing holes. There is the remnant of one hole, to the broken rear of the chape. The surface has a mid-green roughened patina.\n\n\n\nDimensions. 30.84mm wide, 20.39mm deep and the metal is 0.54mm thick, weighing 6.6gm.\n\n\n\nSimilar bag-shaped chapes on the database include: NARC-5DEF37, NMS-99FB70, HAMP-095061, WILT-D4F151, SUSS-C65251, and DOR-BD9AED. The latter example explains:\n\n\n\nA similar, although undecorated, chape is recorded in WILT-D4F151 and another in a Bronze Age Hoard (SUSS-C65251) where Neil Wilkin notes The two bag-shaped chapes (Nos. 3-4) are of a type present in several hoards in South-east England. They are primarily distributed in South-east England and in Northern France, with a small number of outliers in Ireland (O'Connor 1980: 190; List 161; Gerloff 2004, fig. 17.9, 3). Parallels for the bag-shaped chapes can be found in the Mininis Bay hoard, Kent (Ibid., fig.59, no. 12), and a similar bag-shaped chape with two peg holes is part of the Salisbury hoard (British Museum: 1961,006.7; 1998,0901.149). Bag-shaped chapes are often associated with the Carp's Tongue (CT) complex/horizon (O'Connor 1980, 190-91), although Gerloff (2004, 146) notes that their distribution is somewhat peripheral to their principal distribution areas. It is possible that the blade tip (No. 5) belongs to either a Ewart Park or a Carp's Tongue sword, both are types that are closely associated with hoards and deposits that also include bag-shaped chapes (Ibid.).\n\n\n\nThanks to Peter Reavill for providing more information on this type of chape.","fourFigureLat":"51.5144723","fourFigureLon":"-0.9782194","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helena Costas","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.54","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rotherfield Peppard","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rodt/BERKEF7823.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"30.84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
