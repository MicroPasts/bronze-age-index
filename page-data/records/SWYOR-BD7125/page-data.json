The surviving part consists of the blade tip, however the body is missing. The axe fragment is sub-trapezoidal in plan and rectangular with convex faces in cross-section. The body extends while gradually thinning to a flared convex cutting edge with broken and worn corners that expand slightly wider than the body. The blade edge is worn and damaged, while the breaks on the body are also old, patinated and worn. The exterior surfaces of the axehead have a mid-green patina with patches of brown deposition residue.\n\n\n\nThe axe head measures a maximum of 25.8mm in length, 39.0mm in maximum width, 12.6mm in body thickness at the break and 3.4mm thick at the blade edge and weighs 40.49g.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is largely undiagnostic and so a date is hard to achieve. The fragment may have belonged to a flat axe, a palstave or a socketed axe and so its date of manufacture could range from anywhere between about 2500 BC (with the introduction of bronze flat axes) and 700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.9820308","fourFigureLon":"-2.07773199","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Joan Tozer","datefound1":"May 01, 2019","datefound2":"May 01, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Joan Tozer","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stirton with Thorlby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/phil17/SWYORBD7125.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"25.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
