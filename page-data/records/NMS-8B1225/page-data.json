It then expands more dramatically and concavely to form the blade edge and crescentic cutting edge, with tips that recurve slightly. There is a subtle stop-bevel at the centre of the body (between haft and blade) on both faces.&nbsp;\n\nThe flanges extend more or less the full length of the body, from near the butt end to the edge-bevel of the blade. Viewed from the side, the blade, flanges and butt end together form a lenticular profile. The flanges are each divided into three longitudinal facets by two subtle arrises on the outsides. The two arrises (and so the central facet) form a narrower lenticular shape. The facets are covered with multiple cast-in shallow oblique grooves. These alternate in direction from facet to facet so that there is a near-ninety-degree angle between the grooves of one facet and its neighbour (a herringbone pattern).\n\nThe two flat faces of the blade also bear shallow cast-in grooves. Beginning at the stop-bevel and continuing as far as the edge-bevel of the blade, there are five&nbsp;triplets of transverse grooves extending from flange to flange. Some are approximately straight and others are slightly curved. The fifth&nbsp;triplet (immediately before the edge-bevel) on both faces is barely and only partially visible, except at a very limited angle of illumination. The spaces between each triplet on one face is fairly constant at around four to six millimetres. On the other face there is a larger gap of about eight millimetres between triplets four and five, while triplets two, three and four are closer, at four to five millimetres.&nbsp;All surfaces are patinated a fairly uniform mid greenish-brown. c. 1700 to 1500 B.C.\n\nDimensions\nNeedham&rsquo;s (2017; 5) abbreviations in parenthesis.\n\nTotal length (L): 117.8mm\nLength of body, excluding butt and blade edge (LB): 95.0mm\nWidth at butt end (WB): 24.7mm\nWidth at centre of body (W2): 28.3mm\nWidth at 80% of length of body, from butt end (W3): 33.0mm\nWidth at cutting edge (WE) = 67.8mm\nMaximum flange height (HF): 3.7mm\nThickness, including flanges: 19.7mm\nThickness, excluding flanges (MT): 12.3mm\n\nNeedham&rsquo;s (ibid; 6-7) critical dimension ratios\nRWE = 0.576\nRHF = 0.039\nRBS = 0.435\nMRW = 0.905\n\nWeight\n287g","fourFigureLat":"52.45480714","fourFigureLon":"0.48572475","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"March 16, 2020","datefound2":"March 16, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hockwold cum Wilton","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/PFd_64076_8B1225_INDGP01092022AW_BA_FlangedAxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"117.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
