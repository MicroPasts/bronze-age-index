The axehead is 102.23 mm long, with a rounded butt and a body which expands in width towards the blade.  There is no butt stop or transverse bevel visible on the body of the axehead, although the original surface has been removed by corrosion.  The axehead has gentle flanges at the edges of the body, which are concave in profile and are cast or hammered.  In section, one flange is noticeably narrower than the other (the width being a maximum of 10.02mm compared to 11.97mm). It is unclear if this is a consequence of wear or corrosion, or whether this difference was generated in the manufacture of the axehead. The blade is heavily splayed and has a curved cutting edge with a maximum width of 42.41mm.  One end of the blade is worn or corroded away.  The axehead weighs 153.12 grams.  The heavily pitted surface of the axehead has a dark brown patina, and light green corrosion products are also visible on the surface. There is a small amount of recent damage on the more pronounced flanges. No decoration is visible on the axehead.  The low flanges and form of the axe suggest that this is a developed flat axe, within Needham's (1996) period 3 (2050-1700BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.651622","fourFigureLon":"-1.838837","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Duncan Slarke","datefound1":"July 31, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Duncan Slarke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.97","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Swinfen and Packington","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/WMID-OF3992v2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"102.23"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
