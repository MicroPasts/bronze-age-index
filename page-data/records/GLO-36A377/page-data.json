The rear half has flanged sides on both the top and bottom faces that project vertically creating a U-shaped channel that terminate at the stop ridge that is position in the middle of the item. A small triangular indentation sits in front to the stop ridge.  \n\n\n\nThe sides on the front half have a shallow concave arc that expands out to either tip of the blade. The forward edge of the blade has a short bevel (2mm long) on both sides, although one side is steeper than the other and maybe an indication that this item was sharpened in antiquity. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis item is in excellent condition with much of the original patina remaining in the form of a smooth brown layer, this has been chipped of in places leaving a dark green surface behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle Bronze Age 1500 BC - 1150","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"May 31, 2016","datefound2":"September 21, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO36A377.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"142"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
