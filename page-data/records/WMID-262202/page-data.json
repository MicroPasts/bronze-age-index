The septum end (length: 61mm; width: 28.5mm) of the axehead is incomplete with an incomplete butt due to corrosion and a irregular break at the terminal. The septum also has incomplete and corroded flange facets that protrude upwards by approximately 10mm (measured where the flanges are mostly complete) along the outside edge to the left and right and to either side of the artefact. The protruding stop (width of the artefact at the stop: 26mm; thickness: 29.5mm; height of stop to either side: 12mm) is positioned nearly halfway down the palstave.  Below the stop on the blade end of the artefact, there is a slightly dished shield-shaped recess (length of recess: 28.5mm; width: 23.5mm) with raised outer borders on both sides of the axehead, as well as a central protruding ridge running down the centre and beyond this feature (length of central ridge: 54.5mm).  These markings can be described as a ‘trident patterned rib’.  The blade splays outwards towards the curved blade tip (see width above), although none of the original cutting edge remains due to several breaks and areas of bronze disease. The triangular sectioned blade tapers from a thickness of 28.5mm at the stop to 7mm immediately before the blade tip.  Additionally, there is a single and central casting ridge (as a result of the manufacturing process) down the length of either side of the artefact.  Overall, the palstave axehead is in a worn and corroded condition with substantial areas of the original dark brown patina remaining on both sides. There are small areas of bronze disease, which are particularly visible at the butt, side flanges and blade edge of the artefact.\n\nSimilar examples with a trident patterned rib are illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', pages 8 & 13, ref no 46 & 125, which were found in the Wolverhampton area and Co. Antirm, Ballymoney respectively.\n\nOther similar side looped examples with trident patterns are also illustrated in Savory, H, N, 1980, ‘Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections’, pages170-1, ref nos 167 & 176, found at Llysworney, Glamorgan and Tyncochtery, Montgomeryshire respectively.  Savory also details a hoard from Mynydd Tal-y-glannau, Cemmaes, Montgomeryshire, which contains a number of ‘trident patterned’ axes (page 46).\n\nLastly, a similar example with a ‘trident pattern’ is illustrated in Pearce, S, M, 1983, ‘The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part II’, pages 469 & 610, ref no 372b, found at Eglesham Meadow, Colliton Walk, Dorchester.","fourFigureLat":"52.73252803","fourFigureLon":"-1.83853898","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"October 09, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"34.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"King's Bromley","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-262202.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"157"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
