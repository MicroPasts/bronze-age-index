The circular socketed end is broken and partly missing and the cutting edge is worn and nicked in two places and on one side. The gouge tapers in profile from the open end to a point at the cutting edge which is curved into a semi-circle so that it can gouge out sections of wood etc. The surface is pitted and corroded but some of the original patina remains on the inside of the cutting edge, but the damaged edges have become worn and corroded and there are patches of light green bronze disease. Socketed gouges are first seen in the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar socketed gouges from St Keverne, Cornwall on page 570, Plate 9, No.75, from Blandford, Dorset on page 607, Plate 46, No.348f, from Lulworth, Dorset on page 623, Plate 62, No.502m, and from Stogursey, Somerset on page 649, Plate 88, No.746e, which are dated from the Ewart Park phase c.950-850 BC.\n\n\n\nRohl & Needham (1998) illustrate a similar socketed gouge on page 136, fig.38, no.323, which is dated from the Ewart Park metalwork phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.24095911","fourFigureLon":"-5.26907896","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"November 16, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"10","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Illogan","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Jan15finds037.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"43"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
