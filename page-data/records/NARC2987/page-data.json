The cutting edge badly damaged but in plan it appears to have originally been crescentic, the sides of the head taper inwards to a 'waist' at approximately one third up the head from which point on they are almost parallel flaring only slightly  to the flanges. The depression into the handle forms a rectangular shape. Both faces of the head are very corroded but have the suggestion of ribbed moulded decoration. The lip at the junction between the handle and the head is quite straight.  In profile, the head and cutting edge form a narrow triangular shape, expanding to at the handle end into a larger triangle, the palstave is broken off at the end furthest away from the cutting edge.  There is a slight median ridge down both of the sides of the palstave when viewed in profile., the flanges are not high and do not curve inwards.  In cross-section the head is trapezoidal.  There is a single loop which runs from the highest point of the flange to about one tenth of the way down the head.","fourFigureLat":"52.195063","fourFigureLon":"-0.699341","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"the length is given between cutting edge and junction lip of handle, the width at cutting edge and the thickness at the widest part of the flanges.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"November 01, 2001","datefound2":"February 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Easton Maudit","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Wellingborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rharte/narc2987a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"126.17"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
