The tip has a 'U' shaped blade. The gouge has a circular cross section. The object has tapering sides. The upper edge is damaged an uneven. The tip is narrowed, rounded and slightly flattened. One of the long edges faces is flattened. The opposing side is convex. The gouge has a dark green coloured patina with significant abrasion and pitting on the surfaces.\n\n\n\nAn incomplete example is recorded on the PAS database which was discovered in Herefordshire (HESH-A48FE1) the description explains how 'Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC'. Another example has also been recorded as discovered in North Warwickshire WMID-41C97A and also SWYOR-FCB525 discovered in Yorkshire.\n\n\n\nThe gouge measures 46.9 mm in length, 14.2 mm wide, a thickness of 1.8 mm of the gouge walls. It weighs 12.6 g.","fourFigureLat":"52.71438777","fourFigureLon":"-2.25308699","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-650","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Victoria Allnatt","datefound1":"March 31, 2018","datefound2":"April 29, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Church Eaton","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vallnatt/WMIDD84EFB.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"46.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
