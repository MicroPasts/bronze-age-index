The ring is is penannular with a small gap between the terminals, which are flat. The ring is circular in cross section. There is substantial copper alloy corrosion on the interior surface of the ring, suggesting that the ring has a copper alloy core, similar to other examples (SUSS-5EF5C1).\n\n\n\nThese rings are often erroneously referred to as 'ring money' though there is no evidence to suggest that they were used as currency. They are predominantly believed to have been used for personal adornment, such as earrings or nose rings, they have even been suggested as hair ornaments. A complete example can be found in HAMP-0F9AF6 and there are numerous others recorded on the database, some found as part of hoards.\n\n\n\nWork on these rings can be found in (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008), See NMGW-04216C for full references.","fourFigureLat":"50.89308985","fourFigureLon":"-0.87812443","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Edwin Wood","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"14.67","edge":null,"thickness":"3.89","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stoughton","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/RingSUSS1CBAB0.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
