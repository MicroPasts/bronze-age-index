The tang was truncated in antiquity and survives as a square-sectioned stub (with a surviving length of 4.0mm and a width and thickness of 5.2mm and 4.3mm respectively). The chisel is thickest at the shoulder (at 4.9mm). The shoulder mouldings are triangular, with the top edge perpendicular to the tang (with a length of 4mm and a depth of 3.8mm). The sides of the blade are slightly concave and divergent to the eroded blade edge, producing a near-triangular blade from. The blade tips and original blade edge have been lost (with a surviving blade width of 22.8mm). The blade is flat and thins gradually towards the edge (with a thickness of 3.2mm below the shoulder and 2.1mm above the edge). There is the suggestion of hammering forming rippled arcs on both blade faces and striations running parallel to the sides. The surface has a brown to dark-green patina with areas of pale-green surface loss and some pitting.\n\n\n\nThe chisel can be broadly paralleled with an example found in the Brogyntyn Hoard (Savory, 1980, p 123, no 288) in Shropshire, associated with a Hallstatt C sword and a socketed gouge. The Brogyntyn chisel has smaller lugs than this example. In Wales, a similar tanged chisel was found associated with a Ewart Park Hoard from near Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory, 1980, p 122, no 284).\n\n\n\n1.
