The fragment is broadly trapezoidal in shape.  It is rectangular in cross-section, with sides that are triangular in profile.  They narrow from a thickness of 9.7mm at the break to c. 1.5mm at the terminal.  The terminal is slightly rounded.  The artefact is highly corroded with considerable pitting and a highly variable colour. This possibility remains that it might be an ingot.","fourFigureLat":"51.147997","fourFigureLon":"-1.272264","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"March 28, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Micheldever","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-341072flataxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"66.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
