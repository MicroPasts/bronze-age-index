There is some bevelling on both sides of the object caused by hammering the object. When viewed in profile the object is triangular, with the objects again tapering to a point at the blade. There are clear casting seams on both profiles and on one side there is the base of the loop which has probably broken in antiquity. The axe has a maximum thickness of 28.87 mm. The socket is sub-rectangular and there is damage to the edge with some light green, active corrosion. There is a groove which runs around the object, presumably parallel to the original edge of the socket.\n\n\n\nThis object is a Ewart Park Class A1, South eastern type and there are similar objects recorded on the PAS database, see KENT-4B9466 and KENT-2126A8","fourFigureLat":"54.39406546","fourFigureLon":"-1.416265","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lauren Proctor","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lauren Proctor","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.87","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Deighton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/a8622912/DUR-79025D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"69.21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
