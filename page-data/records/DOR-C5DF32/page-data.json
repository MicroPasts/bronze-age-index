The cutting edge is crescentic. The axe is undecorated. There is a faint casting ridge along the centre of the sides of the flanges. The flanges are high, with the tops on one side being somewhat more worn and re-shaped than the other side. The blade is somewhat truncated compared to most axes of this type and the axe is smaller than usual overall. It has a rich blackish patina, although the parts of the surface are pitted and some of the edges are damaged. The palstave belongs to the Taunton phase of metalworking. Dr Kevin Leahy has noted that this axe is unusual in the ratio between the blade and the septum, which are usually of almost equal length (pers comm, 2008) Date: early Middle Bronze Age, c. 1400 - 1300 BC) (Pers comm, D.
