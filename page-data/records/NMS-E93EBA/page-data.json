It is C-shaped in cross-section, with a convex outer and a concave interior. The width of the ring is very consistent but the two ends do not sit quite in line, as if the ring has been slightly bent out of shape. There is a c. 1.5mm gap between the two ends, one of which is slightly incurved and the other slightly outcurved, as if they once joined. The top and bottom edges are neat and parallel, but one is more highly polished than the other, which has a narrow roughened strip by its edge, perhaps keying for solder or perhaps the remains of gold solder.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Diameter 12.7mm, width of ring 5.3mm, thickness of ring 2.1 to 2.4mm, weight 2.8g. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: Although penannular rings are well known Bronze Age finds, they normally have circular cross-sections, or sometimes D-shaped. C-shaped cross-sections are unusual, and are normally found on composite rings made from multiple bands soldered together; there is some evidence that this ring may once have been part of a soldered-together composite ring. Although the band widths on composite rings are usually much thinner than this example, the widest composite rings recorded on the PAS database are WILT-788C7B (2019T253) and ESS-71DFE4 (2014T169), where the individual bands are respectively almost 4mm wide, and 4.5mm wide. \n\n\n\nDate: Penannular rings belong to the middle Bronze Age, c. 1300-1150 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.57823439","fourFigureLon":"1.31937422","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Helen Geake","datefound1":"March 01, 2018","datefound2":"May 30, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"12.7","edge":null,"thickness":"2.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Caistor St. Edmund","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/59730_E93EBA_BA_Ring.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
