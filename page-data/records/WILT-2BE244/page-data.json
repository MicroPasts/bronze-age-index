It weighs 16.81g.\n\nThe rounded point of the knife is apparantly intact, 8mm wide. It widens, one side being straighter than the other (which has a slight curve) over c.120mm (un-bent). It narrows at the tang to 17.4mm wide (from max.width 19.4mm), and probably further beyond this but edge damage prevents an accurate measurment. At this point is a piercing 5.3mm in diameter, clearly pushed through from one side - it shows on the other with a jagged edge.\n\nThe knife has a central mid-rib on one side (being the side with the jagged edge of the hole). It tends to follow the line of the straighter edge of the knife and slightly off-centre. On the other side, the underside of the mid-rib is concave.\n\nThe edges of the knife are slightly jagged and also quite thick - 1.8mm in places, compared to 1.2mm at the tang.\n\nThe knife has been bent just above the mid-point and just over 90°. Beyond this the tang is also bent at circa 90°, so it is parallel with the lower, unbent part of the knife.\n\nTanged knives of this type date to the Wilburton phase (LBA2) and into the Ewart Park phase (LBA3), 1000 - 850 BC.\n\nThe bent knife measures 73.4x19.2x1.8mm.","fourFigureLat":"51.312092","fourFigureLon":"-1.929649","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"September 30, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Urchfont","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Elms1108knife.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"73.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
