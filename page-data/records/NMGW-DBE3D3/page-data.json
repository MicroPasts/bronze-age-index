The butt end is arched and rounded (with a width of 20.3mm and a thickness of 1.6mm) with two side notches to accommodate rivets beneath (with a depth of 3.5mm and 2.8mm, giving a minimum width of 14.3mm at 10mm beneath the top of the butt). The shoulders are weak and poorly defined, with the butt widening very gradually and linearly to the shoulders (to reach a maximum width of 24.0mm, 27mm beneath the top of the butt, where the blade has a thickness of 4.1mm). The blade has a gentle curve beneath the shoulders to narrow slightly (to a width of 20mm). Below which, the blade is moderately straight and gradually convergent to the before narrowing more sharply at the tip. The blade has a flattened central section (8mm wide at the butt) which gradually narrows to a ridge at the tip. The blade edge is largely preserved and does not appear to have any contemporary nicks or blade edge damage. The upper half of the edge appears slightly wasted, possibly through use or sharpening. There are no sharpening striations now evident on the edge. The surface has a brown to black patina with some sandy encrustation, mostly on the lower half.\n\n\n\nThe blade profile would suggest a Group IV blade, the reduced butt may suggest Type Appleby and the rounded butt and rivet notches, would further refine the type to Variant Lakenheath, although illustrated examples with notches by Burgess and Gerloff (ibid.) are reworked. The poor definition of the shoulders together with the flat mid-section continuing above the notches may also indicate that the butt has been reworked. Very few Group IV rapiers had been recorded from Wales (from the 1981) study but a Type Appleby rapier was recovered from the Maentwrog Hoard (Gwynedd) with two other Group IV rapiers (Type Cutts, Variant Hampton Court and a blade with notched butt) and a basal looped spearhead. Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p 106) note that Group IV blades (without 'archaic' butts do not tend to be associated with Taunton metalwork and appear to start in Early Penard and Wallington, suggesting a date of c. 1300 - 1100BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.90088368","fourFigureLon":"-4.64791389","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tudweiliog","county":"Gwynedd","district":"Gwynedd","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/20152531.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"328"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
