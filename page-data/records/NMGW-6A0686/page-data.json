The butt (with a width of 13mm) is straight but angled. Both sides are convex, reaching its maximum width (of 17.1mm) immediately behind the proto stop ridge, before expanding sharply to produce an expanded blade edge. The side facets have been hammered and are also convex across their depths, with a maximum depth at the stop (of 10.9mm and a maximum height of 1.5mm). The angled side facets are decorated linear diagonals, in opposing directions on the opposite facets. There is no evidence for decoration at the central band of the sides. The flanges appear to end immediately before the butt. The septum is straight and gradually thickens to the stop (where the axe has a thickness of 8.9mm and a consistent septum width of 8mm). In front of the stop, the blade is decorated with four incised lines, before an intricate incised motif on the blade, comprising two columns (on each blade) of inverted V's, not quite meeting at the centre. The flanges on the blade give the appearance of converging at their terminals, defining a rounded end. Beneath is the blade facet, which is not decorated and gradually narrows to the blade edge. The blade (with a width 25.6mm) is slightly recurved. The surface has a dark-brown patina with some pitting and surface loss.","fourFigureLat":"51.491714","fourFigureLon":"-3.470589","fromdate":"-2050","todate":"-1700","notes":"The axe has a number of unusual features and does not easily fit into the Developed axe sequence as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981) . The axe is considerably smaller than most developed axes and although similar sized examples are recorded as Type Bandon, Variant Swinton, these are rarely decorated and tend to have a squatter form than the slender form of this example.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 11, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2012.60.1.jpeg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"79.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
