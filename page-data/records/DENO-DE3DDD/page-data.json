Only the tip of the axehead survives. The blade edge is mostly intact and has a convex curve. The fragment has a broadly rectangular cross-section at the break. The break reveals the very tip of the inside of the rectangular socket. The fragment is corroded and pitted, with an olive-brown patina and patches of green corrosion product. Overall, the object measures 20.7mm from the break to the cutting edge, 35.1 mm wide (length of cutting edge), and 9.7 mm thick. It weighs 22.9g. The internal measurements of the socket are 24.7 mm by 2.4 mm.","fourFigureLat":"53.09113411","fourFigureLon":"-1.49376791","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Phil Hughes","datefound1":"June 10, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Phil Hughes","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Crich","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Amber Valley","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENODE3DDD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"20.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
