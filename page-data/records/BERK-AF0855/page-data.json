Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in plan and lozenge in section with mid-ribs. No socket is present. An insufficient portion of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed.\n\n\n\nThe arrowhead is 39mm in length, 16.4mm maximum width, 7mm maximum thickness, and weighs 8.93g.\n\n\n\nThe object was first classified as an arrowhead however the prominent lozenge midrib is diagnostic for spearheads, arrowheads being very rare and more oval shaped in cross section. Not enough of the spearhead has remained to be able to date this fragment to a more precise range, although the circular section, the angle of the blade, and the midrib extending to the to the tip suggest comparisons with spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11. See also BERK-FABE5E also found in Oxfordshire, and YORYM-DDBFB8, YORYM-1AAAE5 as possibly parallels.","fourFigureLat":"51.55285318","fourFigureLon":"-1.30909374","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helena Costas","datefound1":"October 05, 2019","datefound2":"October 05, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helena Costas","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chilton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/helenacostas/BERKAF0855.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
