The fragment is broken at both ends. There is a lozenge shaped socket at the base, broken just before the blades start to project. The socket extends as a lozenge shaped rib at the other end of the fragment. The edges of the blade are incomplete.&nbsp;The remaining portion of the spearhead is 44.5mm long, 21.1mm wide and 11.7mm thick. It weighs 22.7g.\n\nOther fragments of this type are recorded on the database; compare for example records&nbsp;NMGW-5DE788 and&nbsp;WMID-CADEF7.
