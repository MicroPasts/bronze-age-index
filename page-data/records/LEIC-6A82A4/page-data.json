In profile the palstave is lentoid with the widest section being before and after the stop ridge - where it tapers to form the butt and blade. The upper blade is corroded and abraded, though decoration is present at the midrib, consisting of four moulded vertical lines wither side of the stop ridge. The cutting edge of the blade is slightly rounded. On one edge is the remains the fragments of a single loop.  This loop is positioned in line with the stop ridge and extends below this onto the upper blade. The loop is abraded and only partially survives.\n\n\n\nLength: 160 mm\n\nWidth: 39 mm\n\nWeight: 271 g\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Peter Reavill for assisting in identifying this object.\n\n\n\nA undecorated parallel can be seen on the database under HESH-5EC144","fourFigureLat":"52.62912291","fourFigureLon":"-0.95245799","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-1000","notes":"\nRecord created by images and information kindly provided by the finder, this object has not been seen by the FLO.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Megan Gard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Megan Gard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Billesdon","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Harborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/6A82A4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
