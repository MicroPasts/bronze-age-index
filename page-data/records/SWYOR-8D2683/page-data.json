The tang tapers at one end with the terminal missing, and cutting-edge is incomplete. The length  of the remaining portion is 45mm. The object may date from c. 1200 - c. 1000 BC, or possibly a little later. Compare to SF-843F22 and NMS-F87702. Copper alloy woodworking tools are known from the Bronze Age but this is not one of the most common forms, and since it is incomplete, the date cannot be conclusive. Such tools continue in use to the  Post Medieval period for finer woodworking.","fourFigureLat":"53.791109","fourFigureLon":"-1.272869","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"January 01, 1990","datefound2":"December 31, 1990","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sherburn in Elmet","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Selby","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1892_chisel.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
