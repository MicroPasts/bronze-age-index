The blade end is all that remains of this axehead, with the blade tips slightly tapering outwards at the edges.  The break across the top of the blade appears to be an old one.  The blade edge is slightly incomplete.  Overall, the socketed axehead blade fragment is in a worn but fair condition with patches of the original dark green/ brown patina still remaining on either side.","fourFigureLat":"52.723553","fourFigureLon":"-2.149498","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"November 07, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penkridge","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"33"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
