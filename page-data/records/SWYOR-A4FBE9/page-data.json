Only the butt of the axe survives. It is narrow, measuring 23.9mm wide and 5mm thick. The axe has fairly straight sides and flares to 34.8mm wide and 10.7mm thick where it is broken. The break is patinated, though possibly not to the same extent as the rest of the axe. Not enough of the axe survives to be able to classify it precisely. It is 63.4mm long and 103g.","fourFigureLat":"53.91623488","fourFigureLon":"-1.16412211","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"January 01, 2016","datefound2":"May 09, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Copmanthorpe","county":"York","district":"York","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2901_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"63.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
