The casting jet was formed during the casting of a socketed axe in a two-part mould, where the molten bronze was poured into the entrance of the mould around the gate piece which had two conical apertures that the bronze then solidified in once it had filled the mould for the axe. Socketed axes of this type date from the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC).\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar casting jet with conical sprues from Lelant in Cornwall, which was found associated with swords fragments that are from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) on page 571, pl.10, no.82e.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a casting jet from Gussage All Saints in Dorset on page 82, pl.9, no.247f, which was found with a socketed axe mouth fragment.\n\n\n\nThe length is 28mm, the width is 30mm, thickness 17mm and the weight 24.80g.","fourFigureLat":"52.97224312","fourFigureLon":"-0.30382444","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"October 05, 2016","datefound2":"October 05, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Heckington","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM8A5846.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
