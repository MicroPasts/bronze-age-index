The cutting edge survives intact, albeit heavily worn and runs in a very shallow convex curve, the blade tips flare slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaing body appears to be undecorrated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure althoguh part of a casting seam. The axhead is patinated a mid green and the breaks have lead to more extensive corrosion.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length: 30.5mm, Width: 28.45mm, Thickness: 13.31mm, Weight: 21.36g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Although the fragment is too small to be certain, it probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).","fourFigureLat":"51.26699102","fourFigureLon":"0.90852308","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.54","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Selling","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTB614D9.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"30.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
