The axe is of South Wales (Stogursey) Type and is typical of Ewart Park axe heads found in south east Wales. The axe is comparatively short and squat. The socket is sub-rectangular, within an irregular mouth, clearly showing remnants of all four casting runners. The loop is of lozenge section and begins immediately beneath the simple angled collar moulding. The sides curve gently to a slightly expanded blade, producing a curved blade edge. The casting seams shows signs of finishing, probably by hammering, although they seem unfinished near the top of the axe on the unlooped side. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, which appear high and crisp. The sides of the face have a suggestion of enhancing, possibly to resemble ribs. The blade on the better preserved face shows evidence of hammering and sharpening striations near the blade edge. The blade edge has been lost through damage.","fourFigureLat":"51.91434","fourFigureLon":"-3.469821","fromdate":"-1020","todate":"-800","notes":"South Wales axes and variants are prolific in south east Wales with over 120 examples now known as single finds and in hoards. Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).\n\n\n\nThis example represents a northerly outlier to the main distribution.\n\n\n\nSouth Wales socketed axes and related types belong to the Ewart Park phase of the British Late Bronze Age (Needham 1981, 32-37). Recently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800BC cal (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"September 30, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"41.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Glyn Tarell","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1882.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"85.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
