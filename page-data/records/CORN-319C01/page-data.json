The circular socketed end is broken and partly missing and the cutting edge is worn and nicked in two places and on one side. The gouge tapers in profile from the open end to a point at the cutting edge which is curved into a semi-circle so that it can gouge out sections of wood etc. The surface is pitted and some of the original patina remains on the inside and outside of the gouge, but the damaged edges have become worn and corroded and there are patches of light green bronze disease. Socketed gouges are first seen in the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar socketed gouges from St Keverne, Cornwall on page 570, Plate 9, No.75, from Blandford, Dorset on page 607, Plate 46, No.348f, from Lulworth, Dorset on page 623, Plate 62, No.502, and from Stogursey, Somerset on page 649, Plate 88, No.746e, which are dated from the Ewart Park period c.900-800 BC.\n\n\nNeedham and Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar socketed gouge with a circular socket on page 136, Fig.38, No.323, which is dated from the Ewart Park phase also.","fourFigureLat":"50.298691","fourFigureLon":"-3.882796","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"March 31, 2010","datefound2":"May 30, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"18","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bigbury","county":"Devon","district":"South Hams","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Feb12finz 009.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
