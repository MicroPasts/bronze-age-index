The butt end of the axe has been slightly damaged in antiquity and therefore the original shape is not apparent. Part way down the body of the axe is a median bevel, whilst the sides of the axe are rounded. Surface pitting on these sides precludes the possibility of knowing whether or not they were once decorated. Both faces of the axe were once decorated, although most decoration has been removed from one face by surface corrosion. On the well preserved surface there is ripple ornament executed by hammering, over which a complex design has been incised. Immediately beneath the median bevel is a narrow zone of herringbone, followed by four lines of infilled chevrons, parallel to the rippling and the cutting edge of the blade. This is succeeded by four lines of herringbone and then four lines of infilled chevron. Bordering this is a further chevron line, this time infilled in reverse to the other chevrons. This is finally bounded by a line of herringbone, which stops 24mm above the blade edge. This decoration is largely complete, although a small part has been removed by surface pitting at the blade end. Straitions on the original surface near the cutting edge indicates some sharpening of the blade occurred. The axe has a dark green patina, with lighter green surfaces within the areas of pitting. The axe has evidently been coated with a varnish or lacquer, as indicated by its lustre. Blade width 73.2mm, butt width 25.3mm, maximum length 149.0mm, maximum thickness (including flanges) 15.6mm, maximum depth of flanges 2.0mm, distance of median bevel from butt end 61.5mm and weighs 370.8g.","fourFigureLat":"51.62007316","fourFigureLon":"-3.25805983","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"This artefact may be identified as a bronze flanged axe of Needham's (1983) Class 5, equivalent to Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Type Arreton, belonging to period 4 of the British Early Bronze Age and dating to between 1700-1500calBC (Needham et al 1985; Needham 1996). These are the first true flanged axes, used at the same time that tanged spearheads, Camerton-Snowshill daggers and Collared Urns were in circulation. Parallels for this axe within the National Collections are examples from the Ebnal and Menai Bridge Hoards, which both possess bands of short incision decoration below the bevel to the blade (Savory 1980, Cat. Nos.259 and 260). Comparable decoration of hatching and chevrons can be observed on examples from White Horse Hill (Osmington), Dorset, and Stuntney, Cambridgeshire (Needham 1983, Fig.58, Ds 5, Ca 13). These latter two examples, and the Menai Bridge axe, all possess hammered decoration along the sides of the flanges. This axe type has an overall broad distribution across southern England.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"November 01, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanbradach and Pwllypant","county":"Caerphilly","district":"Caerphilly","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20170809134809_00001.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Wales","length":"149"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
