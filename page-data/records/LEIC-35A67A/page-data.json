The palstave is in fair condition with some surface damage and corrosion and is complete. It is rectangular in cross section and form, flattening and flaring outwards to form a wide rounded blade, 51mm wide. When viewed from the side it has an elongated oval form. It has a prominent central stop ridge with a distinct 'shield' shaped depression, with a central ridge, in front of it on both surfaces. Behind this the butt has an H shaped cross section with high, tapering sides.\n\n\n\nThe object is similar to SUR-F78859, BERK-41E4C6 and LIN-7DAAC9 and fits Group 1 (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park phase (circa 1450-1300 BC).
