The object is in fair condition and weighs 14.13grams. The spearhead has a conical open shaft, (9mm in diameter)  which very gently tapers into an integral wide central mid rib running down a leaf shaped blade. This then drops sharply near the upper end to accommodate the thin blade. The edges of the blade and rib are damaged but are largely intact. The shaft is damaged, missing most of its length including the fixing hole. The section that remains has two sub-linear depressions, aligned parallel to the base, sitting on each side of the shaft, below the blade, possibly to aid fixing?  The object has an unusually short profile and wide shaft/ridge.\n\n\nDr Richard Davis has examined this object and has provided the following information,\n\nThis spearhead has a number of  interesting and rare attributes.\n \nFirstly the decorative cuts on  the side of the socket. A number of side looped spearheads from the MBA have  such cuts. Drawings of these can be seen in my volume in the PBF series (Davis, R.  2012. The Early and Middle  Bronze Age spearheads of Britain. [PBF V.5]. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner).    These are no. 227 Rossington, no 276 Matlock Bath, no 307 Irlam, no 347  Waddingham, no 381 Malham Dale, no 413 Cressbrook, no 629 Eyemouth.   No 594  Harpur Hill has crosses rather than horizontal cuts. You can see that  distribution of this attribute is centred on the Peak District.\n \nA couple of other points are of  interest. The midrib ends shortly below the tip, and the blade flattens at this  point. This is characteristic of the kite blade, side looped spearheads (my  Group 3) and the spearheads with wide blade, side loops and shortened midrib (my  Group 5). Both of these groups are dated to the Acton Park phase.\n \nThe spearhead is very short at   52mm remaining, possibly around 70mm when complete. There were some short  spearheads in the MBA, and they had rounded kite shaped blades. Examples are my  no. 151 from Nottingham at 78mm in length and no. 153 Swindon at 68mm in length.  Again these can be dated to the Acton Park phase.\n \nIn summary it is possible that  this spearhead originally had side loops on the lower part of the socket, which  have now broken off. This would be dated to the Acton Park and early Taunton  phases of the MBA.","fourFigureLat":"52.59640132","fourFigureLon":"-1.42567007","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1001","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kevin Leahy","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"May 01, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sutton Cheney","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Hinckley and Bosworth","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/LEIC-F0A3B8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
