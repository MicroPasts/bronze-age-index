The total (incomplete) length of the axehead is  132.6mm, with the blade (from the edge to the stop) comprising 78.56mm  length and the septum/butt measuring 54mm in length. The flanges have  a maximum breadth of 20.3mm. At its widest, the blade is 44.1mm in breadth from  tip to tip.\n\n\nThe blade is narrow and tapering and the axe is narrow and  unlooped; The butt is broken. The axe has a well defined, rounded  stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. The side  flanges are damaged, particularly on one face where recent unpatinated damage shows that the flanges have recently broken off.  The blade is narrow and trapezoidal, widening gently to the cutting  edge, with little added flare to the tips. The blade faces of early midribbed palstaves  generally have raised edges, as if continuing the line of flanges below  the stop (see: \"The Axes of Scotland and Northern England\", Schmidt and  Burgess, 1981, p.126) but this feature is not present on the palstave  recorded here. There is no shield like depression below the  stop. The patina inside the septum is a smooth and brown layer, the butt end of which has flaked off. The butt is damaged, but looks as if it would have been rounded.\n\n\nCompare NCL-8C1FE2 and LANCUM-D90642.\n\n\nTwo Bronze Age spear heads are recorded on the West Yorkshire HER from the same neighbourhood as this palstave, but they are later in date, being from the Penard (1300 BC - 1140 BC) or Wallington 1140 BC - 1020 BC) traditions. They are PRN 2992 and PRN 4186.","fourFigureLat":"53.70322","fourFigureLon":"-1.77426","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"June 30, 2011","datefound2":"July 30, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brighouse","county":"Calderdale","district":"Calderdale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1657_Axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"132.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
