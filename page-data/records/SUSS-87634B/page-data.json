These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material. The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper portion. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the base, which come to a halt about half way along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end, which is roughly sub-oval at its deepest point. At the point where the two symmetrical bars join, there is a plain band of roughly 4.1 mm in width. The distance between the two lower pointed terminal-ends is approximately 14.9 mm wide, indicating that the aperture ranges from 5.7 mm wide to 12.5 mm long. The entire object measures 20.59 mm long, 18.06 mm wide, 9.56 mm thick and weighs 9.48 grams.\n\n\n\nOther hollow examples include: SUSS-3AEC48, WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. Unlike PAS recorded objects WILT-0C9A63 and NMS-0F4645 this example does not have two rivet holes, one each side of the opening. These holes are not seen on complete examples, such as this one, and may suggest repairs or a variation in design. The complete form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings. The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion.","fourFigureLat":"50.85244438","fourFigureLon":"-0.46711013","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"42","notes":"\nAlthough their function is uncertain, multiple hypotheses have been suggested, including decorative mount, dagger or scabbard chape. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example (Oxford Archaeology recovered a stratified example from Clay Farm, Trumpington; however it has yet to be published.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"March 03, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stephanie Smith","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.56","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Patching","county":"West Sussex","district":"Arun","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS87634B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"20.59"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
