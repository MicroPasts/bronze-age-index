With only the lower part of the body and blade edge surviving, it is impossible to classify this socketed axehead to a particular type.  The hollow inside of the artefact is present.  The break probably happened in antiquity and occurs across the width of the axehead in a roughly straight line.  The artefact is in a worn and poor condition with some areas of bronze disease, particularly along the break and inside the hollow cavity.  No remains of the original patina survive and the surface has a variety of colours, mainly orange and light green.\n\nSocketed axeheads represent a change in the method of hafting and production (by hollow casting), particularly in comparison with the earlier flat and palstave axes.  The hafting is now done with the adoption of a handle with a single knee-shaft prong (Savory, 1980, page 48).  Socketed axes date to the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"July 31, 2004","datefound2":"August 31, 2004","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Newport","county":"Telford and Wrekin","district":"Telford and Wrekin","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-26FF21.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
