This, and one small fragment of a palstave were brought to my notice at the Museum; extensive enquiries, however, failed to trace any others which were reputed to have been 'sold to a dealer for sixpence'; etc. The building firm concerned, also, was most un-cooperative. The workmen were questioned as to the appearance of the others and from their description it appears to have been a hoard of eight palstaves and one socketed axe.","museumCollection":"Worthing Museum","museumID":"54/440","collectionIdentifier":"","stolenStatus":"","imageCopyrightHolder":null,"length":"147"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
