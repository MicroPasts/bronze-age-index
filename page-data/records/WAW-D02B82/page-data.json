Only the blade end of the object survives, and the cutting edge is 32.17mm wide and the sides then taper to 29.27mm wide at the break, where it is 12.46mm thick and a rounded sub-lozenge in cross-section. No evidence of the side flanges or stop ridge survive making the object hard to classify and date confidently. The faces of the artefact has a trace of a swollen rib. The surface of the artefact has traces of a dark green patina and is otherwise abraded. The patina is not heavy and there is no pitting on the surface. The patina also covers the break. The tool is 33.86mm long, 32.08mm wide and 12.25mm thick. 47.86g.\n\n\n\nThe artefact is very similar to SWYOR-2DED2C on this database. The narrowness of the blade and thickness at the break are perhaps more similar to chisels such as NMS-894E92, SF2649 and SOMDOR-7B3C43 on this database, but it have the horizontal sides of the more common chisel form, as seen on SF-09D1D5 and SUSS-D93644 on this database. However, small, narrow-bladed palstaves belonging to the Taunton phase (1400-1300 BC) of metalworking or possibly to the slightly earlier Acton Park II period, (c.1500-1400 BC); (both corresponding with Needham's period 5, 1500 - 1150 CAL BC) are also similar, especially in the rapid thickening from blade to break. It was perhaps similar to SOM-1DE687, HAMP-996311. Further arguments on either side are given in SOM-2B70A5, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1600 - 1100 BC.\n\n\n\nThe patina is not typical of Bronze Age artefacts, and therefore there is a possibility that the item is of a later date. Another possible function is a vessel leg, but this is not a convincing identification based on the shape, surface condition and section.","fourFigureLat":"52.16564945","fourFigureLon":"-2.38154056","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"October 09, 2014","datefound2":"April 12, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.25","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Alfrick","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Malvern Hills","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWD02B82.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"33.86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
