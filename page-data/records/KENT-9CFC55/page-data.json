Both terminal corners are slightly rounded while the other fractured end is irregular almost with a central notch. It has a wedge shape in side elevation but flat 'H' shape in cross-section with the edges slightly raised above the centre. There is a dark green patina but half the surface has pitted, pale green corrosion. This is likely to date to between 2300BC and 1450BC. Ref.
