The spearhead is complete, the blade and socket undamaged with a smooth green patina showing hardly any sign of decay. The head is leaf-shaped and the socket has a fairly pronounced midrib. The tip of the spearhead very thin being the same thickness as the socket at its widest point and there are very fine, very clear re-sharpening marks all around the edges of the wings, running parallel to it. The socket is has a wide diameter compared to the overall size of the spearhead and the loops, which are flattened, are situated roughly one third of the way along the shaft.\n\n\n\nThere is some hatched decoration along the sides of the socket where the casting seams had been smoothed down. Side-looped spearheads are categorised by Greenwell and Brewis' as Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating. The length is 95mm, width 15mm, diameter of the socket 15mm and the weight is 39.52g.","fourFigureLat":"54.17703307","fourFigureLon":"-2.81347947","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"April 02, 2009","datefound2":"April 02, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Silverdale","county":"Lancashire","district":"Lancaster","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM-FD2034.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
