The blade is incised on both faces with a pair of parallel longitudinal grooves, approximately 4.7mm in from the edge, at the junction of the oval-section midrib and the bevelled blade edges. The grooves taper as the blade edge does, towards the rounded broken edge, which is not the tip of the blade. The grooves border a central raised mid-rib which is 14 mm wide and 6 mm thick, measuring both faces of the blade together, but more pitted on one side. The wider broken end appears to have been deliberately  and cleanly cut perpendicular to the edge which is commonly seen in the breaking up of swords into fragments for deposition (Matt Knight pers comm). \n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar fragment of a Carp's Tongue sword with two longitudinal grooves from West Knighton, Dorset, on p.99, pl.26, no.325.\n\n\n\nBurgess (1968) illustrates a sword found in the River Thames on page 22, fig.13, no.1 which dates from the Carp's Tongue Complex of the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.32869288","fourFigureLon":"-4.22119839","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"August 31, 2014","datefound2":"January 31, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Dudley","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Maker-with-Rame","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8491.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"35.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
