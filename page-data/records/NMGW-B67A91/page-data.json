The spearhead is broken at both ends and would have been short with a flame- or leaf-shaped blade. The circular socket becomes lozenge-shaped as it defines the central rib of the blade. The remnants of both loops are present at the base of the fragment and appear slight with a circular section.","fourFigureLat":"51.904235","fourFigureLon":"-2.553743","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"This spearhead as been published by Davis (2012, 106, No.650) and falls within his Group 6 Unclassified (Developed side-looped). Davis notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades, which might strengthen the idea that this spearhead originally had a flame-shaped blade, rather than a leaf-shaped blade. The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of similar examples in National Museum & Galleries of Wales' collections (Savory 1980, Nos. 227-230).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"8","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weston under Penyard","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2124.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"40.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
