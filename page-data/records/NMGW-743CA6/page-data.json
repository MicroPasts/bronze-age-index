The edges of both the butt and the blade are damaged, and one face in particular is heavily corroded.  Two distinct casting flaws are visible on the relatively uncorroded face of the axe.  The sides of the blade more or less evenly curve outwards towards the cutting edge from a point situated slightly over one third of the length of the axe from the butt.  The axe is undecorated.  Longitudinal stritations visible on the relatively uncorroded face of the axe adjacent to the blade edge are probably use related polish.  Length 150.5mm, width of blade 89mm, width of butt c.25mm, maximum thickness 11.5mm, weight 503.6g.

Migdale axes lack features such as median bevels, raised edges and the narrow straight-sided form frequently associated with decoration (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35)/  Attempts to subdivide the type on the basis of variation in form have been unsuccessful; graphs plotting indices of shape such as length, width and the ratios of the body width at various points along the length of the axe do not show  discrete concentrations (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35).  The Caswell bay example is closely paralleled by the example from Glangwenlais Quarry, llandybie, Carmarthenshire (Savory 1962-64; Savory 1980, 101 no.112 fig. 17).  As a type Migdale axes are difficult to date with precision.  The typology metalworking stage or assemblage which includes Migdale Axes has recently been dated from c.23000BC to c.1900BC (needham 1996, 130,fig.2)","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip MacDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishopston","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"150.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
