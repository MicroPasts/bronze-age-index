The mouth of the socket, in the interior, is almost circular in plan and measures 29.8mm diameter. The exterior has a single prominent moulded ridge around the mouth rim. Below the rim there is a more feint ridge which is sited just above the side loop. On one side there is an integral loop which is semi-circular in plan and a sub-lozenge in section. Extending from the more feint moulded ridge there are multiple ribs on both faces, five on one face and seven on the other. In plan the axe has slightly concave sides with a slight flaring at the blade. The blade is heavily abraded and the original edge is now lost. The sides of the axe form a shallow ‘<’ shape in section with a casting seam at the apex. The side casting seams have been smoothed slightly, but are still visible. When these seams extend to the mouth rim, the seams have been smoothed to become almost flat. Approximately half of the socket is filled with what appears to be soil rather than organic remains. The socket has been recently cleaned. The surface of the axe has a shiny mid blue/green patina covering the majority of the axe, otherwise there are areas of abrasion and corrosion. There are slight traces of a shiny grey surface on the axe as well. The axe measures 114.04mm in length, 45.22mm wide across the apex of the loop and upper portion of the axe, and is 40.74mm thick across the mouth rim. \n\nThe axe dates to the Ewart Park phase c.1000 – c. 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.193167","fourFigureLon":"-1.869755","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"40.74","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Alcester","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-C2E756.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"114.04"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
