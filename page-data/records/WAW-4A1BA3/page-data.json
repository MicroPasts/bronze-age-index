The axe is complete, but the surface has been heavily abraded and is pitted, therefore there is only one patch of a heavy brown patina.  \n\nIn plan the axe is a sub elongated trapezoid with a rounded butt and flared blade. The butt is rounded, and in profile tapers to a rounded edge. The edges of the septum and body are slightly raised, forming a slight flange. The blade flares outwards, but the blade tips are abraded and therefore rounded. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical which may be due to wear rather than abrasion. In profile the blade forms a ‘>’. \n\nThe axe measures 96.59mm long from the butt to the apex of the cutting edge. It is 49.68mm wide from blade tip to blade it, and is 9.63mm thick at its thickest point on the body. It weighs 131.88g.\n\nThe axe is a similar to a Class 5 example (figure 28 Arreton No. 89) illustrated in Rohl, B. and Needham, S. 1998 The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis British Museum Occassional Paper No. 102. This example is dated to the early Bronze Age, c. 1700 to 1600 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.62409606","fourFigureLon":"-1.60257835","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"March 31, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.63","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Polesworth","county":"Warwickshire","district":"North Warwickshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-4A1BA3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"96.59"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
