The axe has lost the mouth, one of the sides and an area of one face. The remainder of the damaged face has been crushed inwards, although it is now difficult to determine if this damage occurred in antiquity. The more complete face demonstrates the remains of two of the three parallel ribs. The mouth and collar of the axe are missing. The loop is also absent, but the remnants of the lower attachment point are evident on the more complete side. The axe would have had an hexagonal body profile, probably with a slightly expanded blade. The casting seam is visible along one side, and appears to have been finished by hammering. The remains of the socket suggest a rounded rectangular profile. The original surface of the axe has been lost, apart from possible small patches of brown-red patination on the incomplete face and in the socket. The surface damage and fragmentary state of the axe make it difficult to assertion the axe type. The ribs and hexagonal body profile suggest a South Wales (or Stogursey) type, of a relatively small example. However, the absence of the mouth and collar moulding make it impossible to be certain.","fourFigureLat":"51.567457","fourFigureLon":"-3.126753","fromdate":"-1020","todate":"-800","notes":"Socketed axes of a variety of types are prolific in south east Wales as both single and hoarded objects. South Wales axes are the most common, with over 120 examples now known, and have often suffered indicators of deliberate damage such as that seen on the present example. Single, damaged socketed axes are known nearby at Langstone (NMGW162) and Ponthir (PUBLIC-9BD5E6). Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).\n\nSocketed axes of a variety of forms belong to the Ewart Park phase of the British Late Bronze Age (Needham 1981, 32-37). Recently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800BC cal (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rudry","county":"Caerphilly","district":"Caerphilly","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0434.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"68.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
