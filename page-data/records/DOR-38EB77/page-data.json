The axehead has high side flanges which are rounded rectangular in profile stepped at the stop ridges. The tops of the flanges on both sides are tall and the same height as the stop ridge. The flanges taper to the rear ans do not extend into the butt. The stop ridges are rounded at the top, and curved. On one side the stop is undercut with a ‘blowhole’ like casting flaw. The butt of the axe head is the most corroded part, but it appears to taper into a straight edge. On one side, cast on the midline of the flange and with the lower attachment point ibeyond the stop ridge, is a low-arched side loop with a sub-circular aperture in line with the stop ridge. The broad blade is a triangular wedge-shape; it flares from below the stop and terminates in a wide, crescent-shaped cutting edge. The front and rear faces of the blade have a low midrib extending centrally from below the stop ridge to about three quarters of the way down the blade; it is more visible on one side than the other due to surface corrosion. There are traces of the casting lines along both sides from the flanges and down the sides of the blade which have been trimmed and hammered flat when the axe was prepared for use. The object has not been cleaned and there are still areas with soil adhereing.\n\nDate: Middle Bronze Age c. 1350 - 1150 BC\n\nDimensions: 155.2 mm x 57.7 mm x 30.7 mm\n\nWeight: 474 g\n\n \n\n\n\nEd Caswell has kindly commented that this can be classed a a transitional type in the typologies of both Rowlands (1976) and Schmidt & Burgess (1981).
