Based on what survives, the flanges themselves have been abraded in places such that their original profile height cannot be replicated. The stop is pronounced and curved at its junction with the flanges. To one side, on the side, is a sub-oval depression, the only remnant of the loop which is otherwise missing.&nbsp;The blade is relatively short, thinning gradually, but consistently, from the stop ridge and with no, or little, flaring at the blade end. It is not apparently embellished, though the whole is now corroded. Consequently there is very little&nbsp;patination, with the best surviving remnants located at the butt end and being dark green in colour.\n\nMeasurements:&nbsp;97 mm long, 41.5 mm at widest (33 mm wide at stop-ridge without loop) 34 mm thick (at stop-ridge) and xx g in weight","fourFigureLat":"50.39949487","fourFigureLon":"-4.28079534","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"March 24, 2022","datefound2":"March 24, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"34","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Saltash","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley2/DEV41CD0Cpalstave.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"97"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
