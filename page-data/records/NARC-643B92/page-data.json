The awl is square in cross section along most of its length, and tapers to a rounded point at one terminal. At the other terminal it flattens to become rectangular, before ending in a chisel-shaped terminal. \n\n\n\nLength: 57.84mm, Width: 4.52mm, Thickness: 4.14mm, Weight: 4.0g\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark green in colour with a slightly pitted patina. \n\n\n\nCf. OXON-C4D536 on the database which states: Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Awls are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).","fourFigureLat":"52.29029874","fourFigureLon":"-1.34166722","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leamington Hastings","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC643B92.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"57.84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
