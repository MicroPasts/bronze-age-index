It is unlooped with high, curved flanges (max. H.: 26.9mm), fused to the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) measures 70.3mm by c. 16mm. The width at the butt is 19.45mm. The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum height of c. 9.6mm above the septum. The stop ridge is stands c. 6mm above the septum. There is a shield shaped moulding beyond the stop ridge, and fused to it, on both faces (c. 19.5 by 18.0mm). This is bisected by a moulding ridge (seam) running the length of the axehead on both faces (including the septum); this starts on the lower blade and terminates before the butt. Each side of the ridge, within the shield, are two moulded longitudinal decorative ridges (forming a slight trident). There are further longitudinal ridges (casting seams) central on the sides; these have been finished by trimming the casting flash and hammering. The blade is 52.7mm across, with an edge bevel c. 9mm long (but obscured by accretions).  The object has suffered mild corrosion, and slight abrasions to one of the flanges. Where it survives the patina is dark brown; the metal is generally a mid-brown colour, slightly reddish. Spread all over the palstave are orange concretions presumably from local iron deposits.\n\n\n\nThe palstave fits into Rowlands' Class 1, developed shield pattern Group 2 palstaves; many developed shield pattern palstaves have been found in the Southampton area (ibid., 29), perhaps in emulation of what is generally an East Anglian form. This form of axehead fits within the corpus from the later Middle Bronze Age (MBA II), of metalworking tradition phase VIII / IX, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 5 1500-1150CAL. BC. It fits best within the Taunton metalworking tradition although has elements common with those seen with the second phase of the Acton Park tradition. The Rowlands distribution of these is useful, but as his corpus was produced in 1976 it does not include more recent Middle Bronze Age finds which might refine it. A similarly decorated shield can be seen on a palstave from Bottisham, Cambs, illustrated in Rowlands (1976, 293/Plate 27; ref. 339). There are many examples of palstaves with cast ribs on the septum, however the majority of these are grouped in threes rather than singly as on this example; a good parallel can be seen on a palstave from a hoard of 14 from Quex Park, Birchington, Hertfordshire (ibid., 246/Plate 10; ref. 10). This hoard seems to have been contained within a globular 'Deveral Rimbury style' urn.","fourFigureLat":"50.940731","fourFigureLon":"-1.204339","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"\nThanks to Peter Reavill (Shropshire FLO) for his help with description and parallels\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"December 20, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishops Waltham","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-9FE7C0palstave.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"155.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
