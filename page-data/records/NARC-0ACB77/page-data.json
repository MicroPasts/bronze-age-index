The axe suffers from wear and corrosion, but appears to be a  developed  flat axe, possibly of Type Bandon (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 31).  The poor level of preservation makes it difficult to ascertain whether  there was originally any decoration on the axe, so close identification  of the type is tentative.\n\n\nThe axe has low ridges running  along each lateral edge, becoming less pronounced towards the blade  and the butt. A low bevel is situated between these ridges, running  from the butt for 43.6 until a very low stop ridge runs across the face.   This stop ridge is not in the same place on both sides of the axe head,  occurring at 57.7 mm from the butt on one side. The axe has a crescent  shaped blade, 49.12 mm in width. The axe gradually flares in width from  20.2 mm at the base to 31.2 just before the blade. It is lozenge shaped  in profile and measures 103.36 mm in length. It is 3.7 mm thick at the  butt, 12.8 mm thick in its centre and 0.8 mm thick at the tip of the  blade.  It weighs 151.5 grams. It has a very dark green to black patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"January 31, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lapley, Stretton and Wheaton Aston","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-0ACB77 AXEHEAD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"103.36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
