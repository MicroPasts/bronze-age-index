The butt is rounded and the septum is thinner then the blade. The side flanges are low and increase in height from the butt to the stop ridges. On both faces the stop ridges are higher than the flanges. From the stop extends the rectangular cross sectioned blade. The blade tapers in the horizontal plane and is flaring in transverse plane. It termiates in a flared and curving cutting edge. It has a pronounced midrib running from the stop ridge to just before the edge on one face. Details of any edge bevel and casting lines are lost to corrosion. The palstave is heavily corroded, with some losses at its extremities.\n\nReference: Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 58,\n\nDate: Middle Bronze Age\n\nDimensions: 141.58 mm x 47.94 mm x 28.74 mm\n\nWeight: 3.36 g\n\n\n\nDot Boughton comments that this is an \"Early midribbed Palstaves of Type Chepstow\" but that it is too worn to be any more precise. Such axes are are part of the very late Arreton and then, Acton MW assemblage, that is the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1500-1300BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.87975943","fourFigureLon":"-2.4135785","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Bevan","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.74","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pulham","county":"Dorset","district":"North Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucybev/DOR18B605a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"141.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
