The fragment rises up from its semi-circular outer edge, which is about 10 mm in thickness, to the centre of the ingot, where it is broken, and 27 mm in thickness or height. The two sides which look deliberately waisted may have been filed after sections were taken out of the ingot, and have since worn smooth and corroded to form rounded yet defined rectangular edges. There are also a few pits in the base, side and upper surface, which were probably formed from air pockets during the casting process.\n\n\nCaches of copper alloy ingots have been found in pottery vessels at sites such as Porthcothan in Cornwall, and fragments of ingots have been found in Late Bronze Age metalworker's hoards from St Erth and Tregonning, for example. These plano-convex ingots tend to date from the Late Bronze Age (c.1150-700 BC).\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates four incomplete plano-convex ingots from Mountbatten, Plymouth, on page 597, Plate 36, No.281t, which were found associated with Late Bronze Age socketed axes, gouges, chisels and knives, and two from Churston Ferrers in Devon on page 601, Plate 40, Nos.306a-b.","fourFigureLat":"50.175312","fourFigureLon":"-5.36265","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"March 31, 2012","datefound2":"April 07, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"27","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gwinear-Gwithian","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8246.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"63"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
