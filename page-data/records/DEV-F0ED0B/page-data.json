Copper alloy blade fragment; the fragment is broadly rectangular in plan with a lenticular section. The straight sides are abraded. One broken edge is vertical; the other break is roughly diagonal.

Copper alloy blade fragment; the fragment is broadly rectangular in plan with a lenticular section. The sides are abraded. Both broken edges are vertical. Overall the surface has a smooth dark green patina, which has worn away in places revealing a paler green colour underneath. Length: 54mm; Width: 29mm; Thickness: 7mm.\n\n\n\n3. Copper alloy blade tip fragment; the fragment is broadly triangular in plan with a lenticular section. The tapering sides are abraded. Both broken edges are vertical. Whilst still visible in some patches, the smooth dark green patina has mainly worn away revealing a paler green colour underneath. Length: 54mm; Width (at wide end): 27mm; Width (at tip end); 17mm; Thickness: 6mm.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nThe three fragments are likely to be from the same sword. Certainly the broken edges of fragments 1 and 2 re-fit together, and all three fragments are in a similar condition and are fragmented to a similar size. There are no casting flaws visible in the breaks, nor deliberate signs of bending often seen in ceremonial use. The sword is likely to have been broken deliberately as it is unlikely to have broken into uniform fragments through use. Overall the sword was probably broken up as part of the reduction process for recycling (pers comm, M Knight, November 2015).","fourFigureLat":"50.80200336","fourFigureLon":"-3.23595643","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"It is probable that these objects formed a single original deposit.
