Frm the centre of the object, the awl has one sub-rectangular cross section that terminates in a flattened wedge-shape while the opposing end tapers to a point. There is some pitting on the surface of the awl which suggests some age, however there is some debate as to the date of such awls, which probably first appeared in the Late Bronze Age but could conceivably have continued to have been made until much later; here the patina does suggests a early prehistoric date.","fourFigureLat":"51.57965183","fourFigureLon":"-1.27982445","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"July 12, 2013","datefound2":"October 10, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Hagbourne","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013319.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"40.39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
