Soil remains wedged between layers. The object has been folded up and consists of 5-6 layers. The tapering tip of one end of the strip is visible on the outside of the folded bundle. Lines of pointill√© decoration run along both edges of the strip and meet at the terminal. There are three perforations visible on a terminal of the band that tapers inwards forming a triangle with the single perforation at the tip of the taper en\n\n\n\nDimensions (in folded condition):\n\n\n\nLength: 28.23mm\n\nWidth: 19.93mm\n\nThickness (with soil): 5.33mm\n\n\n\nThickness (sheet): 0.18mm\n\nWeight (with soil): 8.55g\n\n\n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip (undertaken at the British Museum) indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94% gold and 6-8% silver, the rest (less than 1%) being copper. (See appended report).\n\n\n\nCurators note: this is a very similar composition to the very similar band from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Of Early Bronze Age date (c.2500 - 1500 BC), and now in two pieces, this is only the fifth or sixth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chacolithic period, c. 2500-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.\n\n\n\nThe function or what object this mount decorated is not certain; suggestions include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps a decorative strip attached to leather. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham & Sheridan 2014, 908-9). The 'near Winchester' find also has three perforations set within the terminals in a similar fashion to a recently reported item from Stratford-Upon-Avon (Treasure case 2016 T209), and Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-1500","notes":"Consequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Mafalda Raposo","datefound1":"August 06, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Ian Richardson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Exhall","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Nuneaton and Bedworth","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2017T798a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
