One side is covered with parallel grooves running along its length, the other is undecorated. The original width of the strip would have been 8.5mm and it is 0.5mm thick. The fragment has been folded diagonally across its width and is now triangular in shape; it is unclear whether this is intentional or simply the result of post-depositional damage. One end has been neatly cut across the width, the other is less regularly cut or torn. The cut suggests a process of re-use or recycling of the original ribbon ornament.","fourFigureLat":"51.13649984","fourFigureLon":"-0.94370312","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-800","notes":"The style of this object with its parallel linear ridges is typical of gold strips and ribbons of known and probable Bronze Age date. Examples from excavated contexts which could lend weight to this dating include an excavated example from Oxford found with a Beaker period flint scraper and pottery (Palmer 1980). Comparable finds recently also reported under the Treasure Act include IOW-CE16C7(2020T431)  and LVPL-954858 (2020 T120).","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"October 13, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Worldham","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURC7CFA4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"13.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
