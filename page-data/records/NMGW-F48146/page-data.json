The body has rounded sides, producing an oval body profile. The sides are straight and divergent towards an expanded blade. The casting seams are no longer evident on the sides. The blade tips have been lost and the blade has a surviving length of 47.5mm. The blade edge has been lost, but the blade has an uneven curvature suggesting greater use-wear on one area of the blade (with the shorter side). Axes tend to have greater blade wear on the looped side. No ribs are discernible on the surviving faces. The socket has a maximum surviving depth of 24.6mm. The axe has a maximum thickness at the break of 21.3mm and weighs 86.0g.","fourFigureLat":"51.766888","fourFigureLon":"-2.943324","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"April 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanover","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.110.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"43.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
