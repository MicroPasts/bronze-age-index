The fragment is the blade end including the base of the socketed area. It is a tapering rectangle in section and trapezoidal in plan with a worn flared cutting edge. The breaks at the socketed end are old and worn and what remains of the surface of the axehead is undecorated.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-brown patina and is worn. The fragment is 43.3mm long, 25.2mm wide, 11mm thick and weighs 35.8g.\n\n\n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.92500591","fourFigureLon":"-1.13349025","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dringhouses and Woodthorpe","county":"York","district":"York","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/RHH0034.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"43.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
