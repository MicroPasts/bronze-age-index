The fragment is broadly sub-rectangular in plan and slightly tapered. A central ridge / mid rib runs along the length of the fragment on both faces making it lentoid in cross-section. The patina is brown and speckled green and the surface is smooth. The breaks at both ends are abraded and at least partially patinated. The length is 40.7mm, width 11.5mm, thickness 1.0mm and weight is 9.91g. A direct parallel for the rapier blade cannot be attributed due to the fragmentary nature and lack of diagnostic features and so a broad Middle Bronze Age date is suggested.\n\n\n\nThe narrowness of the blade and the nearly straight edges suggest this fragment is from a rapier rather than a sword or dagger. Compare HESH-A4380B for a similar fragment, and SOM-71AABB for a near complete example.","fourFigureLat":"54.12584779","fourFigureLon":"-2.04739907","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Diane Gourley","datefound1":"March 25, 2021","datefound2":"March 25, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Diane Gourley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kettlewell with Starbotton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR905F6EPostMedievalBlade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"40.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
