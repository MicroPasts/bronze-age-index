The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow and thin squared butt end which extends to a curved cutting edge with crescent shaped blade. Two large integrally cast raised lozenge shaped flanges are present along the edges of both sides extending from the butt to mid way along the body. The exterior surfaces of the flanges are slightly concaved and no casting lines are visible. Where the flanges terminate a shallow stop-ridge is present on both sides. The axehead is undecorated with signs of wear.\n\nThis axehead fits into the Middle Bronze Age phase specifically that associated with the Arreton and Acton Park metalwork assemblages.\n\nThe metal has a mid greyish-brown patina and is worn. The axehead is 127mm long, 40.6mm wide at the blade, 18.9mm wide at the butt end, 31.7mm thick at flanges and weighs 239g.","fourFigureLat":"54.165478","fourFigureLon":"-0.86809","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Amotherby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/PD0071.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"127"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
