The fragment is 12.9g in weight and has been intentionally bent into a C-shape. The rod has a circular cross section of 4.4 mm in diameter and is undecorated, with the single remaining terminal being flat. The other end has been hammered and cut. The surface of the gold has faint faceting from hand working.\n\nA number of fragments of gold rods of similar dimensions have been found in isolation and recorded by the PAS (e.g. KENT-A071A8 (2017T131), HAMP-8AFE65 (2019T1197), SWYOR-CBC05F (2019T849) etc). Whilst dating these individually can be problematic, very similar cut gold fragments have been recovered from hoards containing diagnostically Bronze Age objects such as the hoard from Fitzleroi farm, West Sussex &nbsp;(BM&nbsp;accession nos. 1996, 0902.1-42). The diameter of the rod and the shape of the terminal on this object can also be compared to round-sectioned bar bracelets of Bronze Age date (e.g, CAM-08B4E0 (2011 T926),&nbsp;LEIC-A3A9AE and NARC-10B4B1 (2019T1165)). The diameter of the rod is also comparable to Iron Age torcs such as&nbsp;NLM-605352 (2013T130), although it lacks the characteristic terminals or evidence of twisting typically seen in these later objects.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-750","notes":"Found at some point in the 1970s/1980s whilst picking potatoes.
