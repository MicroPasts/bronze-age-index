Fragment of a cast slightly tapering cylindrical object, of estimated original diameter c.40mm, interpreted by this reporter as from the socket of a spearhead. The thickness diminishes at the mouth of a putative socket; other edges are broken, and smoothed by subsequent wear. The outer convex surface is dark, while the inner surface appears paler and retains traces of orange soil.
