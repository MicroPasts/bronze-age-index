The object is rectangular in cross-section, and a tapering sub-rectangular in plan. The sides of the object are slightly bevelled. The hammer in section waisted, expanding into a flared undecorated collar at the socketed end. The socket mouth is sub-rectangular. The hammer tapers sharply from the socket toward the mid-point, before again flaring more gently toward the hammer face. The striking face of the hammer shows evidence of use-wear.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a smooth dark green patina with areas of lighter green corrosion.\n\n\n\nLength: 61.48mm, Width: 18.07mm, Thickness: 13.11mm, Width (of socket): 16.85mm, Weight: 51.7g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nThe earliest bronze hammers were created in the Middle Bronze Age Taunton metalwork phase, however hammer finds are more defined in Late Bronze Age hoard discoveries. Socketed hammers became more widespread in the Penard phase (c1200-950BC), and according to Burgess this tradition lasted longer in the North of Britain whereas the characteristics of the Wilburton Phase were prominent in southern Britain during the tenth century BC. Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart-Park Phase which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800BC. Burgess (1968) describes two socketed hammers from the Kilnhurst hoard in Yorkshire, one short and the other long which is similar to the example here. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding. The example described here is more likely a later example in the Penard Phase. Burgess also parallels Penard metalwork to continental examples and in particular western France.","fourFigureLat":"52.15149812","fourFigureLon":"-0.83215728","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hartwell","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC5B738E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Eleanore Cox","length":"61.48"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
