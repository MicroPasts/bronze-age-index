The fragment is now sub-trapezoidal in plan, with breaks at both ends, and broadly lozengiform in cross-section, with flattened side flanges. Both edges have been abraded. The metal has a variable dark-green patina with some pitting and small patches of lighter corrosion product. Unfortunately with so much of the artefact missing, it is very difficult to tell the phase of the Middle/Late Bronze Age to which it belongs.","fourFigureLat":"50.985389","fourFigureLon":"-1.160836","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"November 01, 2009","datefound2":"November 30, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Exton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-7AFF84speartip.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"11.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
