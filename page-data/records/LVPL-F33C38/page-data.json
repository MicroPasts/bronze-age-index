It has a rectangular hollow opening, which still contains some soil. The top then flattens out before narrowing and curving to a point. In form and size it resembles the tusk of a pig or wild boar. Original, but longitudinally cracking surfaces survive on the interior concave curved side however original surfaces are almost entirely missing on the exterior convex shaped side.\n\n\nMicroscope examination of the exterior surface suggests a small area of original surface survives approximately 18-22mm from the tapering tip end, indicating that the object was probably originally tapered in shape and not broken or differentially eroded here. The original surfaces have a dark grey black patina, while the corroded surfaces are a mottled light to mid-grey color.\n\n\nIt measures 56.63mm in length, 37.60mm wide and 14.47mm thick. It weighs 40.4 grams.\n\n\nMetallurgical analysis found the object to be made of pure tin.\n\n\nIdentification of this object is at present unknown, but it was found in the same hole, touching the Socketed Axe head, LVPL-F314E0, suggesting that it is of Bronze Age date and therefore potential Treasure. Tin was a key metal of the Bronze Age, alloyed with copper to form bronze. While there is no determining technological or compositional feature to confidently date this hook-shaped object specifically to the Late Bronze Age, its form and corrosion is consistent with being an ancient rather than a modern object.\n\n\nCareful examination of the hook-shaped tin object suggests it was deliberately shaped as an attachment or handle to a larger object, although the possibilities of it being an unusually shaped adornment, talisman or ingot cannot be discounted. The hollowed-out, widened and sub-rectangular shaped top would appear to have been the point of attachment to a larger composite object, the head slotting into a peg or projecting fitting. Observation of the narrowing end with a microscope gives tentative support for it having been deliberately shaped and tapered, rather than the outcome of differential corrosion and damage since burial. This suggests that it was only secured at one end. It is possible that the tin hook was once the hidden core of a handle or attachment with a sheet or cast bronze outer surface.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Tin or tin alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"August 20, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.47","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Flintshire","district":"Flintshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/LVPL-F33C38.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"56.63"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
