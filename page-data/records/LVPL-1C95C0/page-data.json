The cutting edge is blunt and abraded and is slightly asymmetrical. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the thickest section being at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge descends a vertical rib that extends to the top of the edge bevel. Here the sides are slightly thickened in line with the central rib to create three ribs separated by two hollows.\n\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged and is incomplete. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) on one side is damaged with incomplete flanged facets. No casting seam is evident.\n\n\n\nThe object has a mid green patina with patches of dark brown. The surface is worn and corroded.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 151mm; width 60mm; thickness 25mm; weight 360g\n\n\n\nEarly Midribbed Palstaves belongs to the Acton Park Phase II of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1300BC.
