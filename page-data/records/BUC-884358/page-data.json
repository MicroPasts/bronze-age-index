These phases correspond with Needham's period 5.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a leaf shaped blade, with a pronounced and rounded midrib ridge which runs to the tip of the spear. The tip is now worn and broken, as are the edges of the blade. The blade and midrib cross section is lozenge shaped. The socket is circular in cross section and hollow.\n\n\n\nThe loops are about half way down the socket of the spearhead, these are formed of a narrow rectangular loop plate on both sides. The loops are D shaped in cross section, with an oval perforation. Running along the edges close to the loops are raised casting seams. The socket flares out towards the terminal edge, which is now worn and broken. One part has been folded inwards, and another part is folded outwards.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a dark green patina, with small circular patches of light green on the surface. At the socket end there is traces of orange brown on the surface. The spearhead measures 101.3mm in length, 22.4mm in maximum width, 17.8mm in maximum thickness and weighs 57.51g.\n\n\n\nSee Davis 2017, page 2, figure 6.","fourFigureLat":"51.87406119","fourFigureLon":"-0.9700912","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"December 19, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Quainton","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC884358.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"101.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
