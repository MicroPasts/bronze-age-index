The other end of the body terminates in an old break. This body is 57.1mm in length, the diameter of the expanded terminals is 13mm.Protruding form one side of the body is a tubular side loop which is 36.5mm long, 6.8mm wide and 7.8mm thick. There is a line on the body surrounding the loop, suggesting that the loop could have been cast on separately. The loop extends 4.8mm form the body. On the opposite side of the body there is a sub oval slot, 24.3mm long and 6.9mm wide. There are signs of ware around the edges of the slot. Over all the fitting is 57.3mm long and weighs 39.7g    Bugle-shaped objects are though to comprise a strap fitting for the scabbards of swaord, though their precise function remains obscure. It is possible that thin leather straps were passed though the narrow slot. Refer to other pieces in the collection at the Museum of London (Acc nos A11947-8; A15467; A19001).
