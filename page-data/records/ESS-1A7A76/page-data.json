Only the tip of the spear head remains and is sub-triangular in plan and profile. The edges have sustained damage and the break appears not to be recent.\n\n\n\nThe item is triangular in shape. The mid portion of the spear is cylindrical in section, and there are two triangular sectioned flanges that protrude at each side to prodice the sharp blade edges. The spear tapers to a point, and the breakage is at the opposite end. The surface patina is a light brown with patches of green, and the inside (seen through the breakage) is a light orange/brown.\n\n\n\nDimensions: weight: 7.1g, length: 28.7mm, width: 15.9mm, thickness: 9.4mm","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"\nA date of middle to late Bronze Age was decided by the cross sectional shape to similar items.\n","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"Sophie Flynn","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Colin Rose","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/slflynn/ESS1A7A76.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"28.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
