One barb is missing and the other is incomplete due to old damage. The tang is slightly fluted on both faces, although the fluting is slightly asymmetrical between the two faces. The notches between the barbs and tang are slightly indented on one face. Both faces exhibit a central longitudinal mid-rib, giving a lozengiform cross-section.\n\n\n\nStuart Needham, having examined a photograph of another Norfolk example (NMS-477E93), commented: \"It is interesting to learn of yet another of these arrowheads from British soil. Many years ago I would have ]...[ suspected a collector's loss. However, there are now sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard, Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have to be Early Bronze Age. Bronze barbed-and-tanged arrowheads in one guise or another continue right through and my suspicion would be that most finds are Middle to Late BA. The Penard example proved to have an unusual metal composition suggestive of it being a foreigner.\"\n\n\n\nSimilar in form to: SF-C931F4, SF-4014B0 & SWYOR-3A2CF7.","fourFigureLat":"52.72520219","fourFigureLon":"0.8565404","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-701","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"April 09, 2015","datefound2":"September 28, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mileham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/32098_B061B6_MBA_Arrowhead_Ill.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"30"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
