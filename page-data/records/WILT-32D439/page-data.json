The fragment consists of the point of the blade; it is sub-triangular in plan, with a circular sectioned mid-rib and mid-rib aperture, from which project the wings of the blade. These taper in section into the point. Rest of the spearhead is lost to an old break.\n\n\n\nLength: 32.1mm; Width: 16.5mm; Thickness: 7.6mm; Weight: 8.44g.\n\n\n\nPrecise typological classification is difficult considering the fragmentary nature of the object, however its form would suggest a Middle or Late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.04228563","fourFigureLon":"-1.87300201","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sophie Hawke","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sophie Hawke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coombe Bissett","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridge/WILT32D439.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"32.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
