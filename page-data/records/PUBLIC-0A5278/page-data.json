In cross section it is rectangular to the narrower end and becomes more pointed oval in cross-section towards the blade edge. Due to have pitting no detail of casting seam or simialr casting imperfections are visible. In profile the cutting edge narrows to a rounded point, it is narrow which suggests that it is probably a transitional palstave, although due to wear it is not possible to be certain. There is a worn break across the body of the axe head, and much of the blade appears to be missing likely due to wear/resharpening. The axe head has a dark green mottled patina with patches of light great particularly around the heavy pitting on its surface. All edges are heavily worn suggesting much of the damage occured in antiquity.\n\n\n\nLength: 36 mm, Width: 33 mm, Thickness: 11 mm, Weight: 47.21 g","fourFigureLat":"51.26769928","fourFigureLon":"0.87989308","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mr David Clarke","datefound1":"August 12, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mr David Clarke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sheldwich","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stuff8472/misc447.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
