The object consists of the butt end and the blade which is broken.  The slightly curved attachment end is slightly abraded and measures 24.3mm across.  Below this it is notched (W.: 20.0mm).  Below it expands, with stepped shoulders, to the widest point (W.: 31.55mm).  Beyond the blade narrows gradually, still narrowing at the break, though increasingly less steeply.  The edges of the blade are bevelled on both sides; the cross-section at the break has the appearance of an oval with winged protrusions.  There is a slight curve upwards at the point of break.  The metal has a variable brown patina, with slight patches of blue-green corrosion product and pitting. The artefact perhaps belongs to the Penard metalworking phase.","fourFigureLat":"50.913559","fourFigureLon":"-1.176353","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"August 05, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.25","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Soberton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-D40847rapier.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"92"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
