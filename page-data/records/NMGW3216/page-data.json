The rib is not defined by hollows near the stop, as on some early palstaves. The blade is relatively narrow but has a deeply curved edge. The flanges are leaf-shaped and do not extend along the blade. The stop ridge is undeveloped and is only marginally higher than the surface of the blade. The stop is concave with a shallow 'V' shaped profile. Casting problems have led to damage around the butt resulting in a 'V' shaped intrusion, which should not have effected the usefulness of the axe. The casting seams have been removed but remnants are still visible along both sides. The palstave is complete and in very good condition with a consistent light brown patina. The blade has retained its sharp edge and was probably never extensively used. This form of early palstave dates to the Middle Bronze Age c.1500-1200 BC lying in Needham's metalwork stage 5 (Needham 1997). Butler (1963) has suggested that early mid-ribbed and shield pattern palstaves originate from the initial Acton Park phase of Middle Bronze Age metalworking (Northover, forthcoming p130). The blade shape, low stop ridge and side profile (showing a distinction between flange and blade) may suggest a date towards the end of this form and prior to the introduction of the looped palstave. Length 137mm, blade width 67.9mm (at edge), 29mm (below stop), butt width 22.5mm, maximum thickness 38.3mm, stop height 9.1mm, weight 444.4 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.473737","fourFigureLon":"-3.470011","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"A similar palstave (92.252H) but with a shield pattern and of a more slender form has been found at Penllyn. Also recovered from Penllyn was an unlooped palstave with a poorly defined midrib, but is again more slender than this example and with a less splayed blade. The closest parallel is an example from Llanfylin, Gwent (Green, 1985) although this axe is longer and more slender. Green (ibid.) argues the Llanfylin axe is best compared with the Chepstow type of Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and is paralleled with the nearby Coed Llan hoard of Early Palstaves (Williams, 1877). It could be argued Schmidt and Burgess's 'Type Coed Llan' (1981) matches both axes equally as well due to the absence of flange extensions.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"August 17, 1999","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"38.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"137"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
