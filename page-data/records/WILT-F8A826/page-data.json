It measures 83.50mm in length and weighs 111.42g. It max.width (damaged cutting edge) is 33.80mm, its min.width 14.00mm.\n\nThe sides narrow to the butt and the flanges have been hammered higher on one face than the other. The sides are 12.85mm high (body of axe 9.77mm). The (mostly missing) cutting edge seems to expand at the (oldish) break.\n\nThe butt (which is 2.58mm in thickness) is slightly damaged.\n\nThe surface of the metal is pitted and some of the patina has flaked away. One face has an off-centre hole which does not pierce through to the other side, although there is a slight bulge in the metal there which could represent a shallow stop ridge. The hole is 5.46mm in diameter and 4.27mm deep.\n\nThe hole, which appears to have been drilled intentionally in antiquity, may represent ritual destruction of the axehead. Dot Bruns (FLO Lancashire and Cumbria) comments that both blade and body damage might be in common: Usually the blade is more affected than the body of the axe but there is no reason why they wouldn't have tried to damage the body as well.","fourFigureLat":"51.527881","fourFigureLon":"-1.914903","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"February 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.85","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wootton Bassett","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Gillett0309flataxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"83.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
