The blade has a midrib (11mm wide and giving a maximum thickness of 8.0mm), flanked on each side by a concave section to the blade edge. The blade edges have been lost but the beginnings of the blade edge facets are evident on both sides (giving the blade a maximum surviving width of 30.0mm). The short blade fragment is flat across its length with no evidence of bending prior to breaking but there are battering scars on the midrib on both faces. The surface has a dark brown patina, preserved over much of the fragment with areas of bright green corrosion\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age , Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140","fourFigureLat":"51.77643694","fourFigureLon":"-2.87105051","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanarth","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.42.1 jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"22.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
