The butt is rounded and the sides are near-parallel (with a width at the butt of 18.2mm) as far as the bevel. After the bevel, the sides curve very gently outwards as far as the blade, where the sides turn out sharply to the blade tips, producing an expanded cutting edge with a surviving width of 39.0mm. The edges of the faces are raised slightly (1mm), but have been eroded and the sides are convex across their thickness. The faces are flat either side of the bevel, which is positioned 34mm from the butt. The blade begins 17mm from the edge. The surface of the axe has been largely lost, in addition to the cutting edge and one of the blade tips.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1950","todate":"-1750","notes":"Class 4 axes straddle the boundary between Periods 2 and 3, but this axe can be confidently assigned to Period 3, probably falling within the late Aylesford to Willerby metalworking phases (c.1950-1750 BC) (Needham et al. 1997). At the time of writing (Aug 17) 27 Class 4 axes dating to this period are currently known from across Wales, the vast majority being single finds.\n\n\n\nA Class 4E axe was found at Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan and is now in AC-NMW collections (Savory 1980, No 388.1); it has recently been radiocarbon dated, producing an early date of 1900 -1800 BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katrina Deering","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hannington","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kdeering/DSCN2489.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"77.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
