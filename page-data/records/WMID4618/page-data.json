The object, in plan, is an elongated sub-triangular shape, however the tip is missing, and the lower edge is irregular. A circular socket runs through the centre of the object, gradually tapering. The cross-section of the upper edge is a sub-lozenge shape, the mid point has a circular socket with a slender triangular protrusion on each side visible in the cross-section. The protrusions are the blades which are abraded and slender in width. The surface of the object is slightly pitted, but has developed a dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.444918","fourFigureLon":"-2.104414","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 1985","datefound2":"January 01, 1985","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.92","discoveryContext":"Fieldwalking","parish":"Balsall","county":"Solihull","district":"Solihull","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WMID4618.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"39.73"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
