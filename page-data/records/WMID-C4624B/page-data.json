In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 75.4 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 55.3 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 7.0 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 17.4 mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 28.8 mm).\n\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 64.1 mm long, 24.2 mm wide, and 12.9 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving two rounded corners with a gap between. The butt is 27.1 mm wide and 58.7 mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by.\n\n\n\nIn total the palstave measures 134.8 mm in length, 55.3 mm wide (maximum) and 22.7 mm thick. It weighs 168.3 g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface. \n\n\n\nXRF analysis on this palstave was carried out at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery conservation laboratory, using a Mistral Tabletop XRF machine.

All of these examples fit into the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II).\n\n\n\nReference:\n\nSavory, H. N., 1980.
