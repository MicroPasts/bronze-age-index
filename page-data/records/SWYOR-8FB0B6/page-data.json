The fragment is from near the top of the blade, including part of the trapezoid hilt, but not enough survives to be able to classify it precisely. The blade flares at the top, but has near parallel edges at the narrow end. The blade has a central arris on both faces, making the blade a pointed oval in cross section, and there is a facet along the cutting edge on both sides. The facet is 4mm wide. The fragment is broken at both ends and the breaks are patinated. The object has a dark brown patina which is smooth but with some small circular pits. The surface is slightly reflective in places. Length 84.3mm; width at widest point 39.1mm; thickness 4.9mm and weight 51.93g.\n\n\n\nCompare the near complete rapier SWYOR-7A4C37 and see also the PAS guide to Bronze Age artefacts: https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/rapiers-and-dirks","fourFigureLat":"53.44132354","fourFigureLon":"-0.42070298","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"October 14, 2019","datefound2":"October 14, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Joan Tozer","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Owersby","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR8FB0B6BronzeAgeDagger.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"84.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
