Sword blade fragment\n\n\n\nProbably from a Ewart Park type sword (Colquhoun & Burgess 1988, 55ff).\n\n\n\nLength: 27.3mm; Width: 30.5mm; Thickness: 5.8mm; Weight: 20.63g;\n\n\n\nDiscussion: \n\n\n\nThe two sword blade fragments are probably from Late Bronze Age Ewart Park type swords and are a very common feature of so-called 'scrap' or 'founders' hoards of Late Bronze Age, especially in Southern England (e.g. Needham 1990). Fragments of ingot are also a regular feature of hoards of Late Bronze Age date, however, 'complete' plano-convex ingots of the type represented by No. 4 are rare but they are known from the assemblage of copper alloy and tin ingots associated with a probable Late Bronze Age shipwreck at Salcombe, Devon (e.g. British Museum 2010, 8032.1 and 2010, 8032.191) and from the Late Bronze Age carp's tongue complex hoard consisting of 352 objects from Boughton Malherbe, Kent (Treasure case 2011 T464).\n\n\n\nConclusion: \n\n\n\nDue to their age and number, this find qualifies as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage and Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996, (Designation) Order 2002.\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nColquhoun, I. & Burgess, C.B. 1988.
