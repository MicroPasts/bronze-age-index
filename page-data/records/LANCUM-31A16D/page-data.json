The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade and is bent (possibly deliberately) so that it curves slightly towards the tip. The blade appears to have had slightly curved cutting edges. A prominent raised circular sectioned midrib runs longitudinally down the centre of each face, all the way to the tip and is lozengiform in cross-section. The socket is sub-rectangular and measures 15mm in diameter at the break. The spearhead was probably originally side-looped. The length is 115mm, the width is 35mm thickness 15mm and the weight 54.98g.","fourFigureLat":"53.72921395","fourFigureLon":"-2.5319753","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"October 05, 2016","datefound2":"October 05, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Livesey with Pleasington","county":"Blackburn with Darwen","district":"Blackburn with Darwen","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM31A16D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"115"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
