The remaining portion comprises the tip, which is heavily corroded and has lost most of its original surface. The rear end has a corroded break which reveals the hollow interior of the casting and the sub-rounded cross section of the gouge shaft. A remaining portion of the surface in the concave interior surface of the gouge appears to have striations from use wear.","fourFigureLat":"51.02426251","fourFigureLon":"-2.15821535","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"According to Pearce (1983: 43) these types of socketed gouges begin to be produced in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age, with most being dated to the Ewart Park phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC.
