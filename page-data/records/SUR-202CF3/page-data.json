The surface of the axe is eroded and pitted. Both blade and butt are now missing and there is no indication the axe had a side loop. The septum between the two sides of the socket is 6.5mm wide and below the stop ridge is a shallow hollow on both sides. The damage to the blade is of uncertain origin. The broken edges have flat facets and there is a symmetrical appearance to the break - possibly caused by deliberate chopping.","fourFigureLat":"51.387693","fourFigureLon":"-0.880445","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"June 30, 2006","datefound2":"September 29, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barkham","county":"Wokingham","district":"Wokingham","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCN7742.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"106.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
