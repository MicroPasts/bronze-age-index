The fragment is sub-triangular, with the two longest edges curving towards the pointed tip. There is a worn, transverse break at the other end of the fragment. Both faces have a central rib running down the length of the blade. There is a very slight groove to each side of the rib, before tapering in thickness to the edges. This gives the blade a shallow lozenge cross section. The fragment is extremely worn on all edges and both faces, which are also pitted. One edge of the blade has a small notch, it is unclear if this notch is intentional or part of post depositional damage. It has a mid to dark green patina, which is lighter in the pitted recesses. The fragment is 50.73mm long, 17.5mm wide and 3.81mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"51.055839","fourFigureLon":"-0.974076","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura McLean","datefound1":"February 13, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura McLean","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.81","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Colemore and Priors Dean","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lmclean/HAMP-E18D64 Blade fragment.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"50.73"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
