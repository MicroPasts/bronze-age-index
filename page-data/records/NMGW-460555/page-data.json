The ring is made from a circular sectioned loop. The original surface is missing, and green and brown copper corrosion products cover the ring. The blue corrosion product is likely azurite. Objects such as this are often termed “ring money” or “hair rings” but are most likely a form of personal adornment worn on the nose or ears.  Typically dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, it is suggested in NMGW-04216C that they in fact originate in the Middle bronze age and continue in use until the end of the Bronze Age. This means a wider date range of c. 1300-800BC must be given for this object. \n\n\n\nIt is possible that this object is a core onto which sheet gold or gold/silver alloy would have been fixed. The XRF results may support this as a trace quantity of gold and silver was detected.\n\n\n\nThe finder was kind enough to take an XRF scan of this object. While this will not give precise readings of the metal composition it does give indication as to the elements present. The results were: Cu 42%; Sn 42%; Si 7%; Pb 3%; Au + Ag 0.4%","fourFigureLat":"51.47385782","fourFigureLon":"-1.84301396","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"George Whatley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"18.8","edge":null,"thickness":"6.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winterbourne Bassett","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/ringmoney.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
