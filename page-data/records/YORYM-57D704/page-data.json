The axehead is broadly rectangular, with an incomplete expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt is narrow and incomplete and measures 12.72mm in width and is 3.28mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than having cast flanges. The flanges extend 1.0 mm above the body of the axe head. The expanded blade measures 29.31mm in width and is 5mm thick. The axehead has a green patina, with a corroded and pitted surface.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 72.23mm in length, has a maximum width of 29.31mm (blade), a minimum width 12.72mm (butt), and has a width of 15.82mm in the centre. It is 8.20mm thick at the central point. It weighs 55.30g.\n\n\n\nThis axehead is similar to SWYOR-3DAD49 and DOR-28154A, and is consistent with that of the Arreton type axe, of Early Bronze Age III dating, metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.96399301","fourFigureLon":"-0.52296067","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Denise Wilding","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Denise Wilding","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.82","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bainton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/CW0362.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"72.23"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
