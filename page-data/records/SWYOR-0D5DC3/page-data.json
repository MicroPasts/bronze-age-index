It is a flat sub-rectangular piece of copper alloy, with tapering sides at the long edges and probable breaks for the short edges.It tapers in thickness, and there is a slight hint of a thickened mid-rib on one face. The long edges are chamfered, but have no surface patina surviving, making it impossible to know if they were original edges. The plate is too thick and the edges too abrupt to be part of a blade. The short edges are more uneven, and again, have no surface patina surviving, apart from one small speck in the middle of the shortest edge. They appear to be broken edges, and the patina which has mostly flaked off, could have developed since the breakage.\n\n\n\nOn both faces, there are patches of a more reflective grey material, perhaps a white metal rich alloy. The rest of the metal is dark grey where the patina survives, and light green and textured like fine sandpaper where is does not survive. It is 43.5mm long, 34.9mm wide and 6.6mm thick. It weighs 29.55g.\n\n\n\nThe possible Bronze Age date is given because it comes from the same field as SWYOR-107F44, a Taplow rapier. However, a prehistoric date is by no means certain. The object has similarities to Medieval cooking vessel legs, though it is more worn, thinner and has no evidence of sooting. There are several Medieval finds from the same square kilometer.","fourFigureLat":"53.99094478","fourFigureLon":"-2.15400806","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"January 01, 2019","datefound2":"January 31, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jack Coulthard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coniston Cold","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_3377_OD53C_BA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"43.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
