Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There is a large rectangular rim and recess at the outer edge which could potentially represent a socket from a socketed tool that has been melted into the ingot. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, plate 36, no.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar plano-convex ingot from Churston Ferrers in Devon on page 79, pl.6, no.123b recorded in DEV-D9F1E2 (2011T441) which are dated from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.13122767","fourFigureLon":"-5.33156497","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"June 01, 2019","datefound2":"June 01, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"29","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Breage","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN7762.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
