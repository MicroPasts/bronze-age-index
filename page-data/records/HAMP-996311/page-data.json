The axehead is incomplete and broken into two pieces, with loss due to the break.\n\n\n\nThe blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly convex expanding sides and a very slightly curved cutting edge. In profile the blade is triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The break, which occurs just above the stop ridge, is H-shaped in cross-section and measures 26.18x18.15mm.\n\n\nThe butt-end of the axehead is sub-rectangular in plan, tapering towards the butt, and sub-triangular in profile. On both faces, high flanges rise to form the stop ridge (max.19.21mm high). Between these flanges is a vey thin septum, on one face of which is a small lump of metal, probably a product of corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe palstave retains some of its original smooth dark patina but the majority of the surface is corroded and now a bright green colour with some patches of red-brown. At the break, in both halves, air bubbles are visible in the metal, perhaps weakening it at this point.\n\n\nWith the two pieces fitted together the axehead measures 147.75mm in length. At the widest point, the cutting edge, it measures 47.48mm and at the thickest, the stop ridge, it measures 24.1mm. It weighs 306g.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\nSchmidt P.K. and Burgess C.B., 1981, The Axes of Scotland and Northern England, Munich, plate 61, no.839.\n\n\n\nNeedham, S., 1996 Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, 67.","fourFigureLat":"50.93211327","fourFigureLon":"-1.26140689","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Joanna Cole","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Joanna Cole","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"24.1","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Durley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jojocole/HAMP-996311a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"147.75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
