The top of the mouth is flat (with external dimensions of 54.5mm x 41.7mm and internal dimensions of 33.6mm x 27.8mm) and the remnants of the four casting stubs are evident, positioned near the inner edge of the mouth. The socket is sub-rectangular and appears to retain some sediment (at a depth of 66mm). Beneath the mouth the collar is short (7mm - 8mm) and bevelled to the faces, somewhat rounded in areas. The arched loop (37mm long 12mm high externally and 16.9mm x 6.5mm internally) springs from the base of the collar moulding and is of D-shaped section (5mm wide and 4mm thick). The sides are near-straight, very gently concave (with a minimum body width of 41.7mm) before diverging a little more sharply at the blade. The casting seam is evident on both faces and is now corroded but was raised and carefully finished. The sides are bevelled towards the seam, producing a sub-hexagonal body profile. The blade edge has a slight expansion (with a blade width of 48.0mm) and is moderately rounded. Both faces are straight along their lengths before a subtle but discernible blade facet (27mm from the blade edge) and have a slight convexity across their widths. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, which are near-parallel on one face but convergent on the other. The ribs (52mm - 61mm long) descend from the collar moulding and end before the blade facet. Much of the surface has been lost on the blade but a fragment of original surface survives showing sharpening striations running along the blade. The surface has a variable patina of pale to dark-green with peripheral surface loss and active pale-green corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.92875483","fourFigureLon":"-3.73209048","fromdate":"950","todate":"750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Lead","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Eirini Anagnostou","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Myddfai","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/eanagnostou/2016271.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"100.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
