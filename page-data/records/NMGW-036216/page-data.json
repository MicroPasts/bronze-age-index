The mouth is sub-circular (with a diameter of 18.5mm - 19.8mm) and the rim has a subtle bevel. The loops were flat-topped and oval (18-19mm long, 6mm wide and 2mm high), positioned approximately halfway between the mouth and start of the blade (14-16mm from the mouth and 12-13mm from the start of the blade). One of the loops is damaged and has lost its apex. Above the loops, the socket becomes more oval (12.7mm x 14.5mm) and is marked with prominent incised grooves, with four on one side and five on the other, possibly to imitate or accommodate the binding. The blade is flame-shaped (with a length of 60.5mm and a maximum width of 22.5mm) and has some recent edge damage. The socket continues along the blade to the tip as a prominent but gradually weakening midrib. The blade rib is slightly faceted, possibly because of filing or sharpening the blade. Sharpening striations are clearly discernible on both faces, running along the blade. Blade facets (3mm wide) are evident where the blade edge survives. The break at the tip may have occurred in antiquity through use. The surface has a deep-brown patina with pale green corrosion around the areas of damage.\n\n\n\nThe lateral grooves between the loops and blade are not common features and are difficult to closely parallel.\n\n\n\n1.

A similar side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has recently been dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating. However, overall Davis (2012, 108-110) places this group within the Taunton-Penard metalworking phases.\n\n\n\nDavis (2012) notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades. The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of similar examples in National Museum & Galleries of Wales' collections (Savory 1980, Nos. 227-230).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"19.8","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pont-y-Clun","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.123.1jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"110.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
