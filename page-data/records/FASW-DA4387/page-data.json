Liss-type bracelets are characterised by the form of the incised decoration. This example has at least three, but probably more zones of geometric decoration consisting of zig-zags made up of three or four lines with dotted borders divided by wide bands of cross-hatching. There is a cord motif on the lower edge with a row of dots above it. The bracelet, which has an internal diameter of 60mm, an external diameter of 85mm and a width of 18mm has a sub-triangular section with a convex outer edge and a pointed apex inwards. The surfaces are heavily pitted and much of the decoration is missing. Signs of bronze disease.\n\n\n\nBracelets of this type and other mid-Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' artefacts are not common finds. These bracelets concentrate in the southern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and West Sussex and examples are also known from Suffolk and Norfolk. Incised decorated bracelets form part of a North European tradition, which has led to the suggestion that the examples from southern England may be imported from northern France, although this theory has been questioned (O'Connor 1980). While some of the known bracelets come from hoards containing items such as torcs, pins, axes, palstaves and other mid-Bronze Age artefacts, no other objects were found in association with this example.
