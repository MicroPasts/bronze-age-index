It dates broadly to the Middle Bronze Age and more specifically to the Taunton/early Penard phases (1400-1200 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).\n\n\n\nThis is a complete palstave with leaf-shaped flanges that rise from the septum below the butt to about the height of the stop. It has a long slender butt, with a straight end and a thick septum (c.10mm). In plan, the flanges form a straight, rectangular stop ridge and taper in very slightly toward the butt end. A thick side loop is positioned on one side overlapping the stop ridge.\n\n\n\nThe blade is broad and crinoline in shape, with a curved cutting edge and faint signs of a bevelled edge. The bevelling and curvature of the cutting edge indicates it was worked, which is supported by the slightly asymmetrical form of the edge. This may be the resulting of casting, uneven working or resharpening. There are no macroscopic sharpening or grinding striations visible. Both faces are adorned with a raised midrib, extending from below the stop about halfway down the blade (44.6mm long); it is more pronounced on one face than the other.\n\n\n\nThere is a lateral flattened ridge down each side of the palstave, which indicates the remains of the casting flash which has been ground and hammered down, though it is particularly prominent around the side loop. Furthermore, there is a shallow shrinkage hollow in the septum at the stop on one face, which is a common flaw for palstaves, caused as the metal cools after casting.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is covered in an even, consistent pale brown patina preserving the original surface. Active pale green corrosion is visible in small patches, particularly around the edges and fresh bronze can be seen on one side of the cutting edge indicating post-recovery damage. Patches of dark blue corrosion product can be seen on the septum on one face.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 167mm; Blade width 65.1mm; Butt width: 18.3mm; Stop breadth: 35.3mm; Stop width: 22.7mm; Flange breadth: 33.1mm; Flange height: 10mm; Weight: 503.4g.","fourFigureLat":"51.91556676","fourFigureLon":"-3.36808188","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"A wide variation of palstave types are known from throughout the Middle Bronze Age and this example has characteristics most similar with those from the Taunton phase (1400-1275 cal. BC), but could extend into the Penard phase (1275-1100 cal. BC) (Needham et al. 1997).\n\nClose parallels for this palstave are difficult to identify though. While it appears to fall broadly within Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Group III Low-flanged, it does not conform to any of their sub-types or variants. The combination of a broad crinoline blade, side loop and midrib is unusual. Additionally, the breadth of the flanges is quite large (33.1mm) - typically one would expect low flange breadth to fall below 31mm. In southern Britain, it most closely matches Rowlands (1976) Class 5, Group 1 of broad-bladed looped palstaves. Parallels with lower flanges can be seen in his catalogue from Watchingwell on the Isle of Wight (Rowlands 1976, No.576, Pl.31) and Northamptonshire (ibid, No.811, Pl.30). A similar palstave from Wales is recorded from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-CF16C3), though that example has a flared, triangular blade and lower flanges.\n\n\n\nThe most similar example in terms of form and dimensions was found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012). Deep flanges and crinoline blades are a typical feature of palstaves from South West England and this palstave may indicate influence from this area.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Knight","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Knight","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanfrynach","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2017142.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"167"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
