The socket of the spearhead has a diameter of 17mm and an aperture of 12.5mm. From the base, the stem of the socket gently narrows to a 12mm diameter, at this point the stem connects with the head of the spear. Unfortunately the head is truncated resulting in only the vary base of the blades surviving, but enough survives to suggest the head would have been leaf-shaped. Halfway down the socket, on both sides, is a shallow convex projecting loop that has a very narrow rectangular aperture (currently infilled with corrosion and soil).\n\n\n\nThis artefact dates to 1500-1150BC, see WAW-DC8222 for further discussion.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"March 01, 2017","datefound2":"December 01, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLOEA7229.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"72"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
