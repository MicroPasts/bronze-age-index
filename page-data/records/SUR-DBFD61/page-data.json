The edges of the blade taper from the butt end, are parallel along most of the blade length and then taper to a leaf-shaped point. The butt is trapezoidal with rivet holes to either side, both of which are broken, which would have secured the hilt. Both rivets are missing. The blade is lozengiform in cross section with a broad and very low central spine. The blade appears to have been intentionally bent at the mid point.","fourFigureLat":"51.70699339","fourFigureLon":"-1.58171638","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"Dirks and rapiers of this type belong to Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group IV.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clanfield","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURDBFD61.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"180"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
