The spearhead would date to the Late Bronze Age, circa 1100-800 BC. \n\n\n\nThe object is fragmentary and has damaged and broken upper and lower terminals. The probable spearhead has flared long edges. Extending from the broader damaged short terminal edge is a broadly rectangular piece of copper alloy. It is uncertain if this was originally part of the object or a separate object inserted into the other. The object has a moulded rib along the centre which forms shallow linear grooves either side. \n\n\n\nThe object has a well developed brown coloured patina and worn edges that have evidence of green coloured corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe object measures 32.5 mm in width, 31.7 mm in length which includes the rectangular protrusion, it is 6.9 mm in thickness and weighs 14.6 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.21040891","fourFigureLon":"-1.56237298","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Victoria Allnatt","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Newbold Pacey","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vallnatt/WMID782AF5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"31.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
