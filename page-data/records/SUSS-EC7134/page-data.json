The axe has a curved flared blade that tapers towards the central stop ridge. The rear half of the palstave is subrectangular in shape, thought the very tip of the butt is missing. This rear half has U shaped concave flanks with traces of longitudinal ridges on the interior of the depression. The profile of the tool is diamond shaped, tapering from the stop ridge towards the butt and the blade.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is covered in a bright green patina and is heavily pitted with much of the original surface of the object having been corroded away, though in places the smooth orignal surface can be seen.\n\n\n\nThis palstave shares similarities with WILT-46374E. \n\n\n\nLength (Blade to Butt): 130.03mm\nHeight (Stop ridge): 22.91mm\nWidth (of Blade): 44.6mm\nThickness (Central Stop ridge): 28mm\nWeight: 259g","fourFigureLat":"51.11426843","fourFigureLon":"-2.07280766","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"22.91","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stockton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/PalstaveSUSSEC7134.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"130.03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
