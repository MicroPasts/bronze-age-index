It seems to fit into Davis's Group 2 (2017). It has a triangular blade with ribs on each blade wing, and a prominent midrib, lozenge shaped in cross-section. The socket is circular in cross-section and the socket extends just into the base of the blade midrib. There is a side loop on each side of the socket, positioned very close to the end of the object, away from the blade. The spear head is 124.5mm long, 30.4mm wide and 20.6mm thick. It weighs 103.49gm. The internal diameter of the socket is 15.5mm. It has a smooth golden brown patina with only slight pitting and corrosion.\n\n\n\nDavis (2017) notes that \"Spearheads from the earlier MBA were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket. They date to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC.\" He describes his Group 2: \"Early socketed\" as \"Triangular blade. Socket with short shaft aperture extending only to base of the blade.\"\n\n\n\nDavis R (2017) Later Prehistoric Finds Group Object Datasheet No.5; A Short Guide to Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads","fourFigureLat":"54.22699979","fourFigureLon":"-0.7283497","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"February 01, 2017","datefound2":"February 28, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jack Coulthard","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thornton-le-Dale","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/SWYORBF7F41_AD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"124.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
