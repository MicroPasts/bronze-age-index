The blade has a central midrib that is more pronounced on one face than the other.  From the shoulder, the blade edges taper slightly until a distance of 40-50mm from the tip, when the edge angles more sharply to the tip.\n\nThe slight irregularities of the edges and asymmetry of the edges closest to the tip indicate that the dirk was resharpened on a number of occasions.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"January 01, 1995","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.21","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"","county":"Northumberland","district":"","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/Wightman blade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of Antiquities of the University and Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne","length":"218"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
