It is triangular in plan. There is a highly pronounced median rib, which would have continued down the body of the spearhead, forming a central lozenge-sectioned profile with the wings to either side. The end of the tip is very narrow but has been blunted. The overall condition of the artefact is worn, corroded, and in a poor condition. Very little of the original patina remains. The irregular break at is an old one.  Unfortunately with so much of the spear missing, it is impossible to tell the phase of the Bronze Age to which it belongs.","fourFigureLat":"52.297966","fourFigureLon":"-1.136258","fromdate":"2200","todate":"900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"January 01, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welton","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/NARC-99FB34speartip.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"41.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
