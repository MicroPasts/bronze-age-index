The blade tapers in thickness to the edge with no edge bevel. The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow, squared butt end. The flanges start a short way in from the butt corners and form a pointed oval shape in profile with the crest of the flange being the widest point. The exterior surfaces of the flanges are slightly concaved and no casting lines are visible. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body. There is no obvious stop ridge for the handle to butt against although there is a not very pronounced curved stop on the main body just above the lower end of the wings. The blade is thicker than the septum and tapers in thickness to the crescent shaped blade with no edge bevel. The edge of the blade is slightly chipped on one side.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is undecorated and the metal has a brownish-green patina, with bronze showing in patches, on some edges and the blade.\n\n\n\nIt is 110.5mm long, 44.2mm wide at the blade, 18.9mm wide at the butt end, 35.1mm thick at flanges and 13.67mm at the middle and weighs 197g.\n\n\n\nIf compared with similar examples on this database, this axehead fits into the Middle Bronze Age phase specifically that associated with the Arreton and Acton Park metalwork assemblages. These examples can be found at SWYOR-BAA720, LANCUM-B39815, LANCUM-C126E6 and IOW-DC1AD8, all lacking the stop ridge characteristic of other axe types and with prominent cast flanges. Similar axes can be seen in Schmidt and Burgess (1981), specifically plates 36-38, Early Short Flanged Axes of Type Caverton and Type Cragg Wood.","fourFigureLat":"54.15938396","fourFigureLon":"-1.23580226","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ann Lipscombe","datefound1":"November 29, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ann Lipscombe","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"35.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Husthwaite","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/benwestwood/DUR41AE2E_smaller.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"110.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
