Casting jets are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. The survival of such casting waste is relatively rare in hoards dating to earlier phases of the Bronze Age, but the inclusion of casting jet and other metal casting waste in hoards becomes more common during the Late Bronze Age (cf. Bradley 2013, 128-9). These finds are most common as associations within hoards dating from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC), such as the hoard from St Levan recorded in CORN-E8DF11, which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age. (cf. Treasure Case 2011 W10, PAS ID: NMGW-BA6184 for more examples). Examples of Bronze Age casting jets with multiple sprues are recorded in: LANCUM-8A5846, ESS-E04151, BH-4D6780 and LIN-A52465.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983, p.571, pl.10, no.82e) illustrates a similar casting jet with several conical sprues from a hoard from Lelant in Cornwall, which was found associated with swords fragments that resemble those from the Ewart Park phase. Knight et al. (2015, p.82, pl.9, no.247f) illustrate a casting jet from Gussage All Saints in Dorset which was found with a socketed axe mouth fragment.","fourFigureLat":"50.13817856","fourFigureLon":"-5.40203551","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"December 01, 2018","datefound2":"December 31, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"29","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Erth","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8173.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
