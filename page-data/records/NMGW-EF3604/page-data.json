The axe belongs to Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming). It can be dated to the Arreton metalworking phase (1725-1500 cal. BC), falling within the later half of Period 4 (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997).\n\n\n\nThe axe is incomplete, missing the butt and one of the blade tips. The axe has a surviving length of 73.5mm and would have had an approximate length of 110mm when complete. The sides are straight and near parallel, with a width at the septum of 28.2mm. The flanges and sides are gently rounded and convex, with a maximum height of 15.6mm. The sides have hammered decoration of diagonal markings. The sides curve out sharply just above the blade to produce a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. The blade face is slightly convex, while the face is slightly dished. There is a straight median bevel and the axe has a thickness at the bevel of 12.2mm. Both faces have a number of small hammer marks of c. 2mm diameter. Sharpening striations running along the cutting edge are evident on both faces. The axe has a deep brown green patina which has flaked off in areas. The axe fragment weighs 165.9g.","fourFigureLat":"51.482725","fourFigureLon":"-3.4703","fromdate":"-1725","todate":"-1500","notes":"Class 5/Arreton axes are widely spread across southern England and have a broad distribution in Wales, with 25 currently known from hoards, burials and as single finds. The Penllyn axe falls within Needham's Class 5E group, defined by a broad body and flanges over 1.5mm high. Another Class 5E axe is known from Llanarmon Dyfrryn Ceiriog, Wrexham, and currently held in the AC-NMW collections (Savory 1980, No.118), though this example lacks any decoration on the flanges. A Class 5A axe with similarly decorated flanges was found in the Menai Bridge hoard, Anglesey (Savory 1980, No.259).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/DSCN2904.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"73.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
