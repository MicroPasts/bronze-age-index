The flanges are slightly damaged along the topmost edge on both sides, with heavy pitting on the outward facing sides of each flange. Immediately below the stop ridge is a shield shaped depression. The blade has inward-bowing sides which flare towards the bottom, the thickness tapering to the point where it terminates in a convex cutting edge. There is evidence of a vertical casting seam along the narrower surfaces of the object with tool-marks indicating that this was filed down during finishing. The presence of a casting seam indicates the use of a two-piece mould in production. The flanges and the shield shaped depression also carry tool marks.\n\n\nMuch of the palstave is heavily corroded and carries a green colouring with patches of bright blue discolouration.\n\n\nLength: 142.3mm\n\n\nMaximum width of blade: 61.68mm\n\n\nMinimum width: 25.08\n\n\nMaximum thickness: 30.28\n\n\nMinimum thickness: 3.73mm","fourFigureLat":"51.230867","fourFigureLon":"-2.2735","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.28","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Selwood","county":"Somerset","district":"Mendip","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT-BEF273.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"142.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
