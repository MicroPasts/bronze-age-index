Expanded cutting edge, now asymmetrical; there are indications of small raised flanges down each side of the blade.  It is likely that these were raised by hammering and not cast.  The blade tapers, from its mid-point, towards both the cutting edge and butt.  Most of the surface has been lost to corrosion but enough survives to show that the faces of the axe were not decorated. c. 1800 - 1400 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.479809","fourFigureLon":"-1.486086","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kevin Leahy","datefound1":"June 30, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Kevin Leahy","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"BEDWORTH","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Nuneaton and Bedworth","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kleahy2/080717.02.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"79.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
