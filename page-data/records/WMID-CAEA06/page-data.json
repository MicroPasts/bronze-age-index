The blade is broken below the stop ridge and there is no evidence to suggest whether this fragment is from a looped - or unlooped palstave variant. The break is worn and patinated suggesting that it has been damaged in antiquity; only the lower blade of the axehead survives.  A casting error is present on one flange. The edge of one of the flanges has been flattened with the re-set copper alloy forming a lip.  The fragment has an irregular form in plan with the sides gently widening away from the slightly concave broken edge and terminating in asymmetrical flares due to the manufacturing error.  The cutting edge is lost but retains its convex form.  The fragment is sub-triangular in section.  The section at the break is sub-rectangular.  The surface of the fragment is heavily abraded with pitting and patches of light green patina.   There is no evidence of rib decoration.  Overall, the fragment has a mid green / brown colour. Length: 50.56mm.  Width: 43.82mm.  Thickness at broken end: 16.29mm.  Weight: 112.4g.","fourFigureLat":"52.311245","fourFigureLon":"-0.637262","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Eloise Markwick","datefound1":"March 10, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Eloise Markwick","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.29","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Irthlingborough","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"East Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/eloisemarkwick/WMID-CAEA06.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"50.36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
