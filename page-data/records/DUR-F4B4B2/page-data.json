It has a single small side-loop, which measures 22.96mm in length.\n\n\n\nThe blade has uneven edges, and is corroded, with pitting on the surface, it appears to be missing the cutting edge. The blade is quite small (40.38mm wide), and then narrows to a rectangular section leading to the handle. It is plain and has no ribbing or hollows. The septum on both sides of the handle is quite deep, with a curved end where it meets the blade. The flanges are pronounced, and lozenge shaped when viewed from the side. The side with the loop is the most complete, and it seems only a small part is missing as the flanges have narrowed together.\n\n\n\nOverall the axe has a brown patina, with some pitting and small patches of green corrosion.\n\n\n\nIt weighs more than 200g so my scales could not measure it.","fourFigureLat":"54.225102","fourFigureLon":"-0.559675","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"March 03, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brompton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Scarborough","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/frances/DUR-F4B4B2_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"108.72"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
