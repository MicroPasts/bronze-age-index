It weighs 3.89 grams.\n\n\n\nAwls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They are either circular or square in cross-section, undecorated and were used to make holes in leather and wood. Their form changes little from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods, several of which are recorded on the Portable Antiquities database: for example, HESH-1136D5, IOW-DA8A9A and WAW-8A40C7.","fourFigureLat":"51.72031024","fourFigureLon":"-0.87225084","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"August 31, 2019","datefound2":"November 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bledlow-cum-Saunderton","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Wycombe","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH1C99CD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
