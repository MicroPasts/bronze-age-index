The butt and rest of the body is missing, presumed lost in antiquity. The break is patinated, suggesting that it happened in antiquity.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. At the break, the body of the axehead measures 26.4 mm wide and 12.9 mm thick. Neither the septum or the median bevel are present. The flanges are lozenge-shaped and are likely to have been raised rather than cast. In profile they are D shape and eroded projecting a maximum of 1.0 mm above the body of the axe. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 68.0 mm. There are a series of patinated striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These may be a result of sharpening the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nOverall the developed axe fragment measures 47.7 mm in length, 68.0 mm wide and 12.2 mm thick. It weighs 94.9 g.\n\n\n\nThe axe is a mid brown colour with an even surface patina. There are a couple of areas of pitting where the patina is no longer present, leaving a lighter green area.\n\n\n\nAlthough incomplete the classification of the axe matches the descriptions and illustrations of the axe type Arreton ( (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp65 - 75 specifically 409, 411 and 421) which is dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 CAL BC to 1700 CAL BC. Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.","fourFigureLat":"52.68716296","fourFigureLon":"-1.64638771","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clifton Campville","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-90A351.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"47.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
