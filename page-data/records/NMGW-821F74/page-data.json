The ring is irregular and rounded, resembling a bead, with an external diameter of between 16.2 and 16.7mm. The ring has a width of between 7.4 and 8.5mm and the faces are rounded. The perforation has a diameter of 5.2 to 5.8mm and implies the perforation was cast rather than drilled. The ring weighs 9.9g and has a deep and dark green patina. Bronze beads are not common finds; the form can be paralleled in amber beads from the Late Bronze Age and in Iron Age glass beads. Examples of bronze beads have been found on a number of sites, including The Breiddin Hillfort (Musson, 1991, p 138, no. 165) where a bead with raised cast ornament was dated to the 1st century BC. Larger plain examples have been found at Glastonbury (Bulleid & Gray, 1911, 228, pl. xliv, E195).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.7","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Malmesbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.25.4a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
