BC 1900 - BC 1100.\n\n\n\nOnly the tip of the blade and a small portion of the body of the axehead survive. No traces of a socket remain in the break of the axe, indicating that it is probably not a socketed axe from the later Bronze Age. The object is broadly D shaped in plan and rectangular in section. The blade is flares out from the sides of the object and is crescent shaped at the base. The sides of the object taper out to form a wide V shape. These both perhaps suggest that the axehead is either a flanged or palstave type. The cutting edge is highly abraded, and there is no evidence of a blade facet. The break is heavily patinated which would suggest that it is an ancient one and not the result of recent plough damage.\n\n\n\nThe incomplete axehead measures 29.3 mm long, 52.4 mm wide at the blade, and 37.7 mm wide at the broken end It has a thickness of 3.01 mm at the blade and is 9.2 mm thick at the broken end. It weighs 51.8 grams.\n\n\n\nThe object is a dark green in colour with an uneven patina. There are areas of lighter green corrosion, however it appears that the corrosion is stable. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Other examples of fragments of this kind have been recorded on the database, including WMID-CAEA06, WMID-824953 and HESH-66F770.","fourFigureLat":"52.89395078","fourFigureLon":"-2.34331706","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"September 30, 2015","datefound2":"January 31, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eccleshall","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMIDD67E95.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"29.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
