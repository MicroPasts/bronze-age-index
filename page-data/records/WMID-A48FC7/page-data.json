In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.94 mm (thickness: 2.25 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there may be evidence of a proto stop ridge (median bevel) as the butt does exhibit flattening of both surfaces. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (10.11 mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 27.87 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.\n\n\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.\n\n\n\nIt measures 65.79 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 27.87 mm, width at the butt is 12.94 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 10.11 mm. It weighs 56.5 grams.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped.\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
