The circular socketed end is broken and partly missing, with an internal diameter of 13 mm at the broken edge, and the cutting edge is worn, partly through use, with its orginal surface missing. The gouge tapers in profile from the open end to a point at the cutting edge which is curved into a semi-circle so that it can gouge out sections of wood or other materials. The surface is corroded and pitted but most of the original patina remains on both sides of the gouge. Socketed gouges are first seen in the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar socketed gouges from St Keverne, Cornwall on page 570, plate 9, no.75, from Blandford, Dorset on page 607, plate 46, no.348f, from Lulworth, Dorset on page 623, plate 62, no.502m, and from Stogursey, Somerset on page 649, plate 88, no.746e, which are dated from the Ewart Park phase c.950-850 BC.\n\n\n\nRohl & Needham (1998) illustrate a similar socketed gouge on page 136, fig.38, no.323, which is dated from the Ewart Park metalwork phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.32869288","fourFigureLon":"-4.22119839","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"July 31, 1994","datefound2":"March 30, 1995","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"16","diameter":"13","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Maker-with-Rame","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN5972.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
