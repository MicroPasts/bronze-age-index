The blade cutting edge is slightly convex with rounded tips/corners which are slightly flared. The side faces have traces of a casting seam, but it has been rounded. The break edge of the axe is not too recent as there are traces of a patina on the break, but it does not match the patches of a heavy dark brown patina on the faces of the axe. On this break there are also areas of active corrosion. The surface of the axe has an incomplete well developed mid green patina. \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the cutting edge to the broken edge the axe measures 22.69mm, and from the blade tip of the blade to the broken edge it measures 42.73mm, across the broken edge it measures 11.3mm thick. It weighs 31.15g.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe axe is a socketed axe dating to the late Bronze Age, c.1150 to 700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.18419177","fourFigureLon":"-1.88440772","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"December 20, 2013","datefound2":"August 03, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wixford","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-2FC2AE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"22.69"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
