The blade heavily abraded. The socket end has an oval aperture 10.57mm by 7.97mm. Each edge has a pair of opposed diagonal lines incised on them, creating a feathered decorative affect. One of the thin edges has the feathering go all the way up to the blade while the other stops before the blade begins to fan out. A fifth line exists as a second collar prior to the collared socket. Despite some minor verdis gris around the abrasion on the blade edge the chisel remains in excellent condition albeit in a dull dark brown colour.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 53.08mm long, 23.29mm wide (at blade end, 17.05mm at socket end), 15.91mm thick (at socket end, 2.05mm thick and blade edge) and 21.21g in weight. Socket is 10.46mm high, 8.27mm wide.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Dr. Dot Boughton observes that while this chisel superficially looks like a socketed axe is rather an unlooped woodworking tool. She continues, that it is likely of LBA, Ewart Park (c.10th-8th centuries BC) as shown by the herring bone decoration which is mirrored on some specimens early Iron Age Sompting type axes but not on LBA examples, and it is much better executed than on EIA axes. we could make a case for this being transitional, ie LBA-EIA, 9th-8th century.","fourFigureLat":"51.22656114","fourFigureLon":"0.7197557","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.91","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lenham","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT9E799C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"53.08"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
