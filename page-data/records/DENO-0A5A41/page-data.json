The blade tip is missing, the socket and base of the blade remain, the blade terminating in an old break 30.8 mm from the blade-socket junction. The midrib is lozenge-shaped in cross-section. On either side of the midrib are deep channels. The blade wings are broadly triangular in cross-section.. The ribs do not extend onto the socket. The socket is circular in cross-section, it tapers slightly from 22 mm at the base to 19 mm at the blade socket junction, where it becomes more eliptical in cross-section. Near the rim of the socket are the broken lugs for two loops placed roughly opposite each other, in line with the blade wings. The tip of the wooden shaft of the spear survives in the socket. The object has a pitted surface and a olive green/brown patina with light green and brown patches.\n\n\n\nOverall length 92 mm, width 31 mm, thickness 10.5 mm, Weight 80.8 g.\n\n\n\nStylistically, the spearhead fits into Davis Group 2 Socketed Type B Looped. Richard Davis says: \"The key attributes ... are the V-shaped base to the blade as it merges with the socket. The midrib does not follow the line of the socket, but is narrower than the socket as it enters the V. There is a channel each side of the midrib as it leads to the raised blade wings. The loops are low on the socket. There is a characteristic inward curve of the profile from above the socket to the blade. ... These spearheads represent the first stage of combining the blade with the socket. They are dated to the Arreton Phase 1700-1550 BC based on hoard evidence. Finds of Group 2 spearheads are rare. [Davis'] PBF catalogue comprises 8 with pegholes and 22 with loops. The only local finds from the Group are one with a peghole, dredged from the River Trent at Colwick (Castle Museum collection): and one with loops purchased from a car boot sale and believed to have come from the Trent gravels (DENO-DC4C87).\" pers. comm. 31/10/2018.","fourFigureLat":"53.09476293","fourFigureLon":"-0.7619784","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1550","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Nicholson","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Nicholson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Langford","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Newark and Sherwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENO0A5A41.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"92"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
