The object consists of the butt end and the blade which is broken. The attachment end is slightly curved and in each corner is a rivet hole; one of the holes still contains a flat-headed copper-alloy rivet. The attachment end is abraded one of the holes is incomplete. Below it expands, with stepped shoulders, to the widest point. Beyond the blade narrows gradually, still narrowing at the break, though increasingly less steeply. The edges of the blade are bevelled on both sides; the cross-section at the break has the appearance of an oval with winged protrusions.The artefact perhaps belongs to the Penard metalworking phase.","fourFigureLat":"53.280928","fourFigureLon":"-0.531619","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1050","notes":"\nThis object was recorded at a rally.
