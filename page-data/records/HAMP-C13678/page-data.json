The blade is 128.8mm in length and tapers with ogival sides to a point from a 47.3mm width rear end which has two rivet holes. The blade has lenticular cross section and is decorated with two sets of four parallel grooves which run along each edge of  the blade on both sides, following the line of the taper and merging at the point. The blade edges are bevelled. The midrib merges seamlessly into the profile of the blade. The tip is slightly bent.","fourFigureLat":"50.9654178","fourFigureLon":"-0.91910565","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"\nCamerton-Snowshill daggers are generally deposited within burials with a largely Wiltshire and Dorset distribution and have a date range that is believed to span the Early to Middle Bronze Age transition.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"March 28, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harting","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMPC13678.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"128.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
