The weapon is socketed (existing socket size 7.3 mm in diameter). The object is unfortunately broken at both the socketed end and the blade end. The result of the socket causes a convex ridge to run down the obverse and the reverse of the blade. In profile the object is therefore oval with a wing at either side. The edges of the blade begin to taper towards the break at the socketed end of the object, whilst the ridge caused by the socket continues to expand - the original socket size would therefore be somewhate larger than that which remains. Determining whether this find is an arrowhead or a spearhead is not aided by its fragmented nature, although socketed spearheads seem to be better attested than socketed arrowheads in the literature concerning the later Bronze Age. Examples of socketed spearheads are illustrated in Needham (1990, 55; 32/72, 47, 82) and Langmaid (1976, 53; 19).","fourFigureLat":"52.089803","fourFigureLon":"-0.965132","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Paulerspury","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-5997F0spearheadsection.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"17.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
