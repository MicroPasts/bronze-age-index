The tang (28.2mm long) is of square to rectangular section and tapers to a point. The point (33.4mm long) is of circular section (5.63mm maximum diameter) with straight sides converging to the point. There is no collar or flange between the tang and point. The awl has generally good surface preservation with a dark brown patina. Abrasion marks are discernible at the top of the point.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"The awl is not diagnostic, but copper alloy awls have been recorded from the Late Bronze Age (Butler 1988), with several examples known with a square-section tang and round-section point (e.g. Otterhampton, Somerset - SOMDOR-E51C44; and Tarrant Rawston, Dorset - DOR-6DF7F6).\n\n\n\nExamples of similar form, made of iron have been found in Iron Age (Museum of London Accession Number LBL5.3b) and Roman period contexts (see Manning 1985 pp39-41). Medieval period awls often have a collar between the blade and tang (Ottaway & Rogers, 2002, pp 2728-30). The deep patina on this example suggests the awl is of some age.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"August 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"5.63","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Luckington","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.175.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"61.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
