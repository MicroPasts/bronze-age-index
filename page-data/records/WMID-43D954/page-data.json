The mouth is sub-rectangular (45.0 mm long and 41.9 mm wide). The socket is rectangular (29.2 mm wide, 28.0 mm long and 95.8 mm deep).&nbsp; The mouth moulding has a well-defined rectangular step (9.7 mm long) with a prominent step to the face. The oval sectioned loop springs from the moulding (13.4 mm wide, 4.9 mm thick and 26.6 mm long). The sides are straight&nbsp;before widening to a moderately expanded blade edge (50.0 mm). The blade edge survives in places, with some damage in the centre showing bronze corrosion (making the edge look flatter), and gently curves out to the blade tips. There are a series of nicks at the blade edge, mostly in the central area beneath the patina. One side has some damage, which has cut through the patina, particularly on one edge. The casting seams are visible but have been neatly finished. The sides are slightly bevelled towards the central seam but are comparatively straight for the type, producing a near-rectangular body section. Both faces are decorated with five near-parallel ribs, terminating in a pellet, which extend over half the length of the face (for 58 mm). The ribs are even and neatly cast, but damaged beneath the patina on both faces. The faces are gently convex across both their lengths and widths and there are no blade facets.\n\nOverall it measures 123.3 mm in length, 50.0 mm wide (blade edge), 46.8 mm (socket) and 45.2 mm thick (socket), 2.1 mm (blade). It weighs 386.4 g.\n\nThe socketed axehead is a dark brown colour, with an even surface patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.96572596","fourFigureLon":"-2.38855191","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"April 18, 2022","datefound2":"April 18, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"45.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Maer","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Newcastle-under-Lyme","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID43D954.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"123.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
