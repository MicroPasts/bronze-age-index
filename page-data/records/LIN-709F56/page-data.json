The blade gently flares to the cutting edge; the sides are straight, and in section the blade is rectangular. The cutting edge is abraded and appears to have been reground several times owing to the lack of expanded blade at the edges.The axe has a pronouced stop-ridge on both sides, though on one side it is damaged. Two moulded ridges run away from the stop-ridge down the blade on both sides. These ridges are difficult to see on the side that has suffered the greatest damage. The butt is incomplete.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the axe is variable. Towards the cutting edge the blade on both sides has a smooth surface with green-brown patina. It is heavily pitted towards the stop-ridge on one side. The butt is heavily pitted on both sides.\n\n\n\nThe length of the axe is 125mm, and the height across the blade is 39mm. At the stop ridge it is 25mm in height, and 24mm in width.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nDavey, P.J., 1973. Bronze Age Metalwork from Lincolnshire. Archaeologia, 104, 51-127.\n\n\n\nNeedham, S., 1996.
