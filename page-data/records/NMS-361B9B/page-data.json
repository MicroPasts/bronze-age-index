It is circular in cross-section for just over half its length, and then flattens to a rectangular cross-section. The circular-section area&nbsp;tapers gently and smoothly from 5.0mm in diameter in the centre to 3.8mm in diameter at the end, which has a worn break. The rectangular-section area maintains the width, flaring slightly to 5.4mm,&nbsp;but flattens to 1.5mm thick at the blunt, perhaps incomplete, chisel-like end, which is slightly curved&nbsp;in the direction of one of the larger faces. This bend has not caused any stress to the metal, so may be original. The object is in good, relatively unworn condition with&nbsp;a dark green patina and crisp, sharp arrises. The total length is&nbsp;65.7mm and the&nbsp;weight 7.4g.\n\nCopper-alloy awls are generally thought of as Late Bronze Age in date, 1000 to 800 BC. Compare&nbsp;NMS-6FB233,&nbsp;WMID-7999D4, LEIC-711C38 and BH-1C99CD for the smooth shape and clean lines; SF-211AE4,&nbsp;BERK-44881E and HESH-ED08F3 for the slight bend.","fourFigureLat":"52.42226145","fourFigureLon":"1.10168549","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-801","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"July 28, 2019","datefound2":"July 28, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winfarthing","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/PFd_62922_361B9B_INDTL10032020HG_BA_Awl.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"65.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
