It measures 217.25mm in length, 56.32mm in max.width, 25.21mm in max.thickness, 26.48mm in diameter and with a socket depth c.183mm. Weighs 160g (to the nearest 2g).\n\n\nThe spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.5.5mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly curving until the tip where it angles inwards quite sharply.\n\n\nAll original patina has been lost and the metal is a coppery brown in colour. There are several area of bright green deposit on the surface, probably the result of corrosion.\n\n\nThe spear may have been a deliberate contemporary deposition in a river.","fourFigureLat":"50.82576681","fourFigureLon":"-1.57543743","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"December 31, 1969","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"26.48","edge":null,"thickness":"25.21","discoveryContext":"Unknown","parish":"Brockenhurst","county":"Hampshire","district":"New Forest","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-5FEE35.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"217.25"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
