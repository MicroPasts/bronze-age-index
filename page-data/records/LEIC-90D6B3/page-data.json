The fragment is very abraided and consists of a triangular fragment with an eliptical cross section and represents part of a handle and blade of a sword. The object consists of two seperate pieces of metal, the blade and the handle fragment which surrounds it. When viewed from above the blade, 35mm long, has a narrow eliptical cross section which becomes narrower and thicker as it travels through the handle, until it has an oval cross section as viewed from below.\n\nThe blade is surrounded by the upper part of the handle. On both sides, the upper edge of the handle drops down and inwards from each end forming a semi-circular depression in its centre and creating sub-rectangular &#39;projections&#39; at each side. It also tapers in width, narrowing towards the present base, to accomodate the users hand. On each side of the handle, centrally placed in the projections are &#39;dummy&#39; rivets. These are positioned to correspond with those on the opposite side and one set are slightly deeper set than the others (The rough sketch attached shows the position of the &#39;dummy&#39; rivets).\n\nNeil Wilkin has identified the fragment as &#39;belonging to a relatively small group of British swords with &#39;solid&#39; bronze hilts rather than organic ones (Burgess &amp; Colquhoun 1981, 122, no. 751-5), including a recent discovery from Cherry Burton, Yorkshire (YORYM-958D05). This type of sword has parallels in continental Europe (cf. Von Quillfeldt 1995) . In terms of chronology, it belongs to the Late Bronze Age of the Ewart Park phase (c.950-800 cal BC)&#39;.","fourFigureLat":"52.70846408","fourFigureLon":"-0.78774109","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"May 11, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whissendine","county":"Rutland","district":"Rutland","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/LEIC90D6B3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"47"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
