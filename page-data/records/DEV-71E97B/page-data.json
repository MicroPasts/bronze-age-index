The Palstave comprises of the blade only, the butt-end, including the entirety of the septum and flanges being lost to an old break at the stop ridge. The vestigial remains of loop are present, with a broken and abraded projection from one lateral face below the stop ridge. Each broad face features corroded rident or shield shaped decoration, cast in low relief below the stop ridge. In plan the blade flares widely into a crescentic cutting edge, but with no evidence for flanged blade tips, whilst in profile the blade narrows notably below the stop ridge, before tapering more gradually into the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 75.4mm; width 42.4mm; thickness 26.4mm; weight 209.45g.\n\n\n\nA comparable palstave, also found in Devon, can be seen recorded at DEV-8907FD. A Palstave featuring very similar \"trident\" decoration can be seen illustrated by Pearce (1984, no. 809), described as being of high-flanged South-Western type. Another comparable palstave, although with lower flanges is published by Knight, Omrod & Pearce (2015, no. 460), from a small hoard in Somerset. Comparable palstaves on this database include LVPL-135122 and WAW-B8887E. The axehead probably fits into Needham's group III and the Acton Park II or Taunton metal working phases, and probably dates to c. 1500-1300 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.65289463","fourFigureLon":"-3.65642937","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Christow","county":"Devon","district":"Teignbridge","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEV71E97B.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"75.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
