The break occurred in antiquity and there is no socket base evident on the fragment. The blade edge is convex and is incomplete, with approximately two-thirds represented. The original edge has been lost through corrosion. The surface is heavily-pitted and corroded and very little of original surface survives with a green-black patina.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"The small fragment represented makes any identification uncertain.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/20141753jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"14"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
