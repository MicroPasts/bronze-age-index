It narrows to a rounded point (2.3mm in diameter) over  25.5mm. The tang is square in cross-section where it extends from the wide end of the conical body, measuring 5.7x5.6mm. It thins to 2.5mm thick and 5.8mm wide at the recent break.\n\nThe patina is a smooth, shiny green in colour with patches of a brighter green corrosion product. The damaged end of the tang and the very tip of the conical body show a purple-brown coloured surface beneath.\n\nThe awl measures 56.3mm in incomplete length, 8.2mm in max. width, 7.8mm in max.thickness and weighs 8.59g.","fourFigureLat":"51.14953043","fourFigureLon":"-1.58677235","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"November 09, 2014","datefound2":"November 09, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Over Wallop","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP9D75CA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"56.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
