The axe is in fair condition, retaining about half of its original surface, and has a green patina. The axe weighs 415 grams and is complete. The septum is 65mm long and 7mm thick and is rectangular in form with slightly bulging sides, 23 to 29mm. The flange is 29mm at its widest and tapers sharply, ending 10mm short of the butt, which is flat. The stop sits about 5mm proud of the blade surface and tapers gently outwards to meet it. At this point the blade has two 'comma' shaped indentations, 20mm long and 12mm wide, which sit either side of a slight ridge which runs the length of the blade, together they form a heart shaped motif. The blade itself starts 27mm wide and thick and tapers gently to a point 53mm wide and 1mm thick. The blade has a stright edge and it tapers so gently in width that the blade facet is almost invisible. The side loop is 3mm in diameter and is 20mm wide and 8mm high.","fourFigureLat":"52.627725","fourFigureLon":"-0.804748","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"August 31, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leighfield","county":"Rutland","district":"Rutland","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/15F0B5a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"153"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
