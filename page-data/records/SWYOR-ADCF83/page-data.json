The blade is lentoid in section tapering to a point at each side. Both ends are broken and the damage is not recent. The fragment is possibly part of the Wilburton or Ewart Park metalwork assemblage tradition and dates to c. 1150-800BC but the fragment is too small to be certain of this. The surface is slightly pitted and has a light brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"53.565842","fourFigureLon":"-1.186144","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"May 11, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Adwick","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 823 blade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"22.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
