Part of the socket has been broken off and the tip pf the spearhead is missing. The blades are short and leaf-shaped. The hollow of the socket extends 46 mm into the the spear. It is circular and tapers towards the tip, becoming lozengiform in cross section as it develops into the solid mid-rib between the blades. There are two small, oval, pierced side loops set opposite each other part way along the socket. There are traces of casting lines along the sides of the spearhead running from above the side loops to the base of the blades. Below the side loops, the casting lines appear to have been smoothed away.\n\nDate: Early Middle Bronze Age, c. 1600-1400BC\n\nDimensions: 68.80 mm x 22.06 mm x 13.22 mm\n\nWeight:. 27.58\n\n\n\nDot Boughton suggests LANCUM-7609C0 on the PAS database as a parrallel in which record she notes \"Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.\"","fourFigureLat":"50.73522697","fourFigureLon":"-2.56817768","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.22","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Frampton","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/caht/2D27D7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"68.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
