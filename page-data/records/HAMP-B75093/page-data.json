The object consists of the butt end and the blade which is broken. All of the edges have been abraded and broken to a greater or lesser extent.  The attachment end is broadly curved.  It expands from this point to shoulders that reach a maximum width of 32.45mm.  Above one of these shoulders is a removal.  From this wide point the blade narrows gradually, still narrowing at the break, though increasingly less steeply. The edges of the blade are bevelled on both sides; the cross-section at the break has a broadly oval appearance. Where it survives the metal has a mid-green patina, which blackens towards the blade. There are large areas where the patina has been lost to corrosion. The artefact probably belongs to the Penard metalworking phase.","fourFigureLat":"51.020362","fourFigureLon":"-1.031889","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"August 11, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"East Meon","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-B75093rapier.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"58.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
