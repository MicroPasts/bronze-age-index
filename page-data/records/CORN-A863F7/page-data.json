The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the uneven edge suggests accidental manufacture. There is a brown corrosion layer over much of the surface and light green patches of bronze disease. This was probably produced during the casting of copper alloy plano-convex ingots during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates shallow ingots from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, plate 36, no.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar shallow ovate ingot fragment from Marldon in Devon on page 79, pl.6, no.146a (see DEV-677584).\n\n\n\nComparable to a globule of casting waste found in the St Levan hoard (2016 T20) in record CORN-E8DF11, which is dated from the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.10621313","fourFigureLon":"-5.56762893","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"October 31, 2015","datefound2":"October 31, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penzance","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Sep16finds038.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"67"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
