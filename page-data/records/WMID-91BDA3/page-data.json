In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 88.35 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 40.27 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 2.93 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 16.68 mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 24.46 mm).\n\n\nBeneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a tapering central rib. This rib extends approximately half way down the length of the blade. The rib itself, although present on both sides, is crisper and less eroded on one of the two faces.\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 62.63 mm long, 17.55 mm wide, and 8.13 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving one corner rounded. The butt is 19.25 mm wide and 3.09 mm thick. The loop is 26.42 mm long, by 8.83 mm wide and projects 9 mm.\n\n\nThe flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. On one side the flange facets are convex and curve over to almost form an open socket. Whereas the other side has less pronounced or developed facets.\n\n\nIn total the palstave measures 149.45 mm in length, 40.33 mm wide (maximum) and 25.72 mm thick. It weighs 262.3 g.\n\n\nSeveral casting flaws in the form of air bubbles are present on the septum. The poor quality of the casting is confirmed by an xray of the palstave which demostrated several large air bubbles within the internal structure of the palstave.\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.\n\n\nSimilar examples to this palstave can be seen in Savory, 1980; catalogue entries 171, 172, 175, and 263 (the Mynydd Ta-y-glannau, Cemmaes Hoard). All of these examples fit into the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II).\n\n\nReference:\n\nSavory, H. N., 1980.
