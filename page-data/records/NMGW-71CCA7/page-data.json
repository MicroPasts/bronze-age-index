This palstave type is familiarly known as the 'Transitional Palstave', (Smith 1959; Schmidt & Burgess 1981) and is best paralleled in welsh material with the Cammaes hoard and corresponding metalworking tradition. Nortover (forthcoming) has suggested that Cemmaes metalworking is contemporary with the Taunton phase (c.1600-1200BC; Needham et al 1997) in England; although Taunton palstaves are generally of the 'Low-flanged' type, with transitional palstaves generally being of the Penard metalworking stage (c.1400-1000; ibid.) and possibly continuing into the Wilburton metalworking stage (c.1300-1000; ibid.). The palstave has a short butt, which has been damaged in antiquity on one side. This break has occurred through an air bubble in the bronze. The loop is missing, and was placed relatively far back, beginning immediately after the stop. Casting flaws are further evidenced with a hole at the stop on one side. The axe has diverging sides resulting in an expanded crescentic blade edge. The blade has a bevelled edge which begins as the sides significantly diverge. The moulds may have been slightly miss-aligned, resulting in a change of direction in the profile in the sides of the axe. The casting seem on the looped side has not been placed central to the sides. The loss of much of the surface of the axe has made it difficult to decipher the trident design on the faces, the split angular triangular motif against the stop can be made out, but the central rib, can no longer be seen.","fourFigureLat":"51.54961512","fourFigureLon":"-3.11188969","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Michaelstone-y-Fedw","county":"Newport","district":"Newport","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0519.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"114.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
