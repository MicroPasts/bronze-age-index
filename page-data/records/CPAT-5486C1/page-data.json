Sompting axes are typical of the Llyn Fawr phase, technically seen as the Bronze-Iron Age transition and sometimes now called the Earliest Iron Age (800-600BC). \n\nThe axehead has a sub square section mouth. The fixing loop is then drawn from the lower moulding to extend 24mm down the side moulding with an inner diameter of 8mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe axe is undecorated with flat plain sides, no edge chamfer and broadly splayed to the cutting edge; the seam sides are wedge shape in plan and slightly convex with clear casting lines. Although there are numerous marks/gouges to the surface of the axe, they look to be due to the passage of time in the ground. There are no clear signs of use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing to the damage to the axe; there is significant and extensive damage that appears to be contemporary with the date of the axe. One side of the blade has been struck very hard with a heavy round object such to cause the axe to bend and split on the opposing face. The edge of the blade has then also been struck several times with a similar heavy round object, leading to an almost denticulate edge with four clear strikes. The damage must have been deliberate and had rendered the axe useless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for the damage may only be speculated at; it may have been an unsatisfactory casting or perhaps prepared for votive use or simply come to the end of its useful life. The surface has a bright mottled green patina with some original smooth brownish surface patina still in evidence.","fourFigureLat":"53.094252","fourFigureLon":"-3.285714","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-600","notes":"Plain examples in Schmidt & Burgess (1981) The Axes of Scotland and Northern England.
