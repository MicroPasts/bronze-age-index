The line of the butt end meets in a gentle curve at this point.\n\nBelow the blade flares from the stop ridge to the cutting edge, 32.1mm wide, perhaps curving outwards slightly just above.\n\nThe object has a thick light green crust largely lost in places to reveal a dark grey colour beneath. It measures 134.7mm in length, 32.1mm in max.width (at the cutting edge), 23.5mm in max.thickness (at the stop ridge) and weighs 152g (to nearest 2g).","fourFigureLat":"50.84042241","fourFigureLon":"-1.02141351","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"When originally discovered the finder reports that the axhead was in sulphurous-smelling wet salt-water mud. He kept it in a sealed, wet environment which lead a month later to severe deterioration of the surface crust. Claire Woodhead, Conservator, Hampshire Cultural Trust, comments '[The] surface crust is unusual; brittle and porous. It is unclear how much metal remains in core. There is a possibility that copper sulphides have reacted with the water to form sulphates (i.e. sulphuric acid) which may have contributed to decay' (June 2019). The object has been air-dried and the flakes of crust reattached wherever possible, as evidenced in the 'after' photos attached to this record.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"May 01, 2019","datefound2":"May 01, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bedhampton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Havant","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP7DAF44d.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"134.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
