Cast looped socket of a side looped spear head. The loops are long - circa 20mm - and narrow - circa 3.8mm, and projecting circa 3mm from the wall of the socket, and appear entirely separate from the blade (which is lost). The socket is gently tapered, from 17.6mm diameter at the shaft end to 15.5mm diameter towards the blade. The shaft end appears to exhibit signs of a recent break; at the blade end the break appears more weathered, though should still probably be ascribed to relatively recent times. Suggested date: Middle Bronze Age, 1500-1150 BC.\n\n\n\nLength: 66.2mm, Diameter: 17.6mm, Thickness of socket wall (clear of loops, at blade end): 2.7mm-1.9mm, Weight: 27.24gms.","fourFigureLat":"53.650421","fourFigureLon":"-0.609593","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Martin Foreman","datefound1":"October 14, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Martin Foreman","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winterton","county":"North Lincolnshire","district":"North Lincolnshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mforeman/NLM21186a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"North Lincolnshire Museum","length":"66.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
