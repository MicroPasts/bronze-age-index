However it is incomplete as the lower portion of the socket is broken and missing. In section the central socted forms a rounded hump which then immediately tapers to teh blade edge. \n     \n     The tip of the arrowhead is blunt and rounded. The blade edges are tapered and narrow in depth as the edges splay outwards. The surface is slightly pitted. \n     \n     The socket is broken just below the 'rhomboid' corners. The break is not recent, but does not appear to have occurred in antiquity. The patina is slightly different on the break. The socket is 8.5mm in diameter. The socket void is slightly off-centre, therefore the thickness of its walls vary.","fourFigureLat":"52.157217","fourFigureLon":"-2.118355","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Watson","datefound1":"January 01, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"White Ladies Aston","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"52.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
