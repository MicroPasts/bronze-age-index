The fragment is sub trianglular in plan, and droops slightly towards the point. It is lenticular in cross section and still sharp. The sickle has a light green patina and is truncated by an old break. \n\n\n\nDimensions: 31.27mm in length; 13.55mm in width (at the break); 1.55mm thick; 1.9g in weight.\n\n\n\ncf. a similar, but more complete sickle found at Edington Burtle (Pearce 1983: 512-513, no. 648).
