The palstave is complete and is comparatively short with a length of only 119.3mm and a weight of 301.2g. The butt is slightly concave and has a width of 22.8mm. The sides are straight and parallel as far as the stop, with a width at the stop of 28.5mm. The flanges begin from the septum and below the butt. The flanges are rounded across their length and reach a maximum height of 28.4mm before the stop (46mm from the butt). The sides are slightly concave across their height, turning inwards at the flange tops. The septum is straight and has a thickness of 9.3mm. The interior of the flanges and the stop are right angled to the septum. The axe has a thickness of 24.7mm at the stop and the stops have a depth of 8.8mm above the septum. While the flanged area of the axe is of normal length, the blade portion of the axe is unusually short with a length of 51mm. The sides of the blade diverge gently, before out-turning sharply at the blade tips and producing a curved blade edge with a width of 48.7mm. The original blade edge has been lost. The flanges continue along the blade face, forming short ribs (15mm long). The blade face has a central, poorly-defined rib, which is less deep than the height of the stop. Either side of the central rib are rounded depressions against the stop. The central rib forms a central bevel on the face and produces a convex profile across the width of the blade face. There is no discernible blade facet. The axe has poor surface survival and is pitted. Small areas of the original surface survive with a dark green patina, notably at the blade and over the septum. At the blade, sharpening striations are evident running perpendicular to the blade. The axe has recently been coated in an oily substance. It is now unclear whether the short blade is the result of deliberate manufacture, possibly for a specialised function or less likely, is the result of prolonged use and wear.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanharan","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2007211.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"119.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
