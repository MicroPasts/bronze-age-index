The object is in fair condition and weighs 13.95 grams. The object consists of a solid sub-circular terminal 9.5mm long and 8mm wide. Below this the object has a rectangular form which widens and flattens sharply out to a terminal which appears to have been broken, as though ripped. The fragment begins with a width of 8mm and widens and flattens to 11mm where it has broken. The underside of the shaft is concave, which is most pronounced near the terminal and its upper side remains slightly rounded.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The object is very similar to NMGW-E48854 and PAS-B9D6E5 both dated to the Late Bronze Age. Similar bracelets, and their wider context, are discussed by Eogan (1994, 80-108).","fourFigureLat":"52.75521532","fourFigureLon":"-0.97907093","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"As the object is made of gold and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\n\nEogan, G. 1994, The Accomplished Art.
