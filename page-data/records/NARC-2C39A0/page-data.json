The object is a side-looped spearhead. The retained portion is composed of the socket and side loops while the blade is missing due to an old abraded transverse break. \n\n\n\nThe retained portion of the objected comprises a hollow cylinder which narrows toward the blade end. There is a split along the length of the shaft which is irregular and possibly due to miss casting. There is a casting seam on both sides of the object in line with side loops. \n\n\n\nTwo side loops project from either side of the socket and there is a slight rib running on both upper and lower surfaces between \n\n\n\nLength: 39.02mm, Width: 14.95mm, Thickness: 2.02mm, Diameter (socket): 14.21mm, Diameter (blade end): 10.32mm, Weight: 11.3g\n\n\n\nThe metal is mid-green in colour with a slightly pitted patina. \n\n\n\nSide-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' (1909) Class IV which they date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Davis (2012) has recently provided a more thorough typology of Bronze Age spearheads in Britain in which he dates side looped forms to The Acton Park Phase (1550-1400 cal BC) (Davis 2012: 108) with the suggestion that in some areas this use may be extended slightly into the Taunton Phase (Davis 2012: 108) (1400-1250 cal BC) their exact position in these periods being dependent on the form of the blade. This portion of the spear being missing a date of c. 1550 to 1400 cal BC is most appropriate (following Needham et al. 1997).","fourFigureLat":"52.27733699","fourFigureLon":"-0.82885285","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"14.21","edge":null,"thickness":"2.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Overstone","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC2C39A0.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"39.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
