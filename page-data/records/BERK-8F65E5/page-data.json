The fragment consists of the curved tip of the blade, to a depth of only 15.52mm. The blade expands evenly either side from the cutting edge; the outer tips or edges of the balde are damaged, and internally the blade is solid at this point. The curve of the blade suggests this is a palstave rather than an axe, but it may be a later Bronze Age socket axe head. Because of the fragmentary nature of the artefact it is not possible to identify it further.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"1400","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"October 01, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.28","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stone with Bishopstone and Hartwell","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013816.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"56.13"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
