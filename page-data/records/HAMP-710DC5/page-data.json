It has a lenticular longitudinal cross-section and rectangular horizontal cross-section. The tang end is flat and measures 13.5x1.7mm. It expands to 18.7mm wide (and 8.5mm thick) at the stop-ridge, beyond which the edges of the blade below flare to a cutting edge 29.9mm wide (and 2.3mm thick). The cutting edge is slightly curved and the very edge is chamfered to both faces. Otherwise the edges of the object are sharp and c.90 degrees.\n\nThe patina is bluey-green in colour and smooth to touch. The chisel measures 96.4mm in length, 29.9mm in max.width, 8.5mm in max.thickness and weighs 84.55g.","fourFigureLat":"51.17723143","fourFigureLon":"-2.02999113","fromdate":"-2250","todate":"-1900","notes":"Dr Dot Boughton comments, 'Developed flat axes .... are very early - Migdale and Aylesford metalworking tradition, that is Early Bronze Age period, probably dating from c. BC 2250 - c. BC 1900. This fits with Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC. There are parallels on the database:  WMID-4175F6; and possibly  NMGW-4FCA62 There are parallels in Schmidt and Burgess: nos. 312A and 312B (plates 26 and 27). These are plain - most other developed flat axes seem to be decorated' (pers. comm.
