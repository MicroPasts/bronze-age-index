The two loops no longer survive but sprung from either side of the socket, probably fairly near its base. One of the faces is missing as far as the end of the socket, probably as a result of corrosion but possibly the result of casting problems. The socket would have enclosed the shaft around the loops, but the metal is now torn and distorted at this point. The base of the socket is missing. When found the socket contained remnants of the spear shaft.\n\n\n\nThis is Davis' (2012, No.559, Pl.33) Type 6E and can be broadly dated to the Acton Park and Taunton metalworking phases (Davis 2012, 108-110; Needham et al. 1997).","fourFigureLat":"51.77681581","fourFigureLon":"-3.66828217","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1275","notes":"The wood (weight - 1.7g) was removed with the permission of the finder and has been kept at NMGW for future analysis.
