The rim comprises a pair of horizontal ridges, separated from each other by a shallow groove. Portions of two of the body's slightly convex surfaces remain, with a near-right-angled corner between. The top of the side loop springs from the rim's lower ridge; it is of suboval section and overlies a vertical casting seam. The patination and wear of the edges suggest that the piece became detached in antiquity.\n\n\n\nLength: 37.4mm; width: 22.8mm.
