The tang (32.6mm long) is square to rectangular sectioned gradually narrowing to the end (6mm square at the collar and 3.0mm x 1.4mm at the end). There is a perpendicular step to the collar (2mm deep) of sub-oval form (11.1mm long and 9.3mm wide) and narrows below the flanged shoulder (with a minimum width of 7.8mm). The sides of the blade are curved and divergent to the slightly damaged blade tips and the blade edge is near-straight, curved at the ends (giving a blade width of 20.5mm). The original blade edge has been lost with no definite evidence for differential wear across the blade edge. The blade faces are near-flat and thin gradually towards the edge (with a thickness of 7mm below the shoulder and 0.8mm above the edge) and with no evidence for blade facets. There are striations beneath the patina on both faces, running both along the blade and up the blade. The surface is pitted with a mid-green patina and areas of surface loss. \n\n\n\nTanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Earliest Iron Age. An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the many may be dated to the Ewart Park phase (c.950-700 BC) and into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).\n\n\n\nTanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt 'C' sword.","fourFigureLat":"51.47395858","fourFigureLon":"-2.03018701","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bremhill","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/NMWPA201926.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"50.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
