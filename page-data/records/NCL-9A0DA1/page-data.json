Each coil is made individually from a solid gold wire. The wire is circular in section.\n\n\n\nIn addition to being cut, the ring has been damaged due to bending, with two of the wires separating from the rest and bending at different angles. This damage indicates that the coils were probably heated and then pressed together along their lengths, as there is a slight flattening of the coils along the lengths revealed.\n\n\n\nFor comparisons, see 2005 T495.","fourFigureLat":"55.25817","fourFigureLon":"-1.985811","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"The age and precious metal content of this item therefore qualify it as treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"April 15, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.49","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hepple","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/DSCN0405.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of Antiquities of the University and Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne","length":"26.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
