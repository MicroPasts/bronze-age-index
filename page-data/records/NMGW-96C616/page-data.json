The axe is represented by a blade fragment only, and has a surviving length of 32.1mm. The original surface of the axe has been lost, and little surface detail survives. The axe was probably comparatively slender and has a minimum width across the break of 21mm. The break is eroded and round and shows no evidence of a socket base. The sides expand to the blade tips, which are now rounded, giving a blade width of 35.5mm. No evidence for casting flashes survive on the sides. The blade edge is curved. One face is relatively flat, while the other has the suggestion of a blade facet surviving, beginning c. 10mm from the blade edge. The fragment weighs 28.4g. The bronze is heavily pitted and has a dark green to brown patina. The fragment is likely to originate from a palstave of Middle Bronze Age date, but may be from an earlier developed or flanged axe of later Early Bronze Age, from c. 1700BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.60874385","fourFigureLon":"-3.45992718","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"February 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tonypandy","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.28a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
