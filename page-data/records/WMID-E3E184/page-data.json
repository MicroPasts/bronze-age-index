The spear can probably be assigned to Davis's Group 7 'Special Side Looped'. The object has a broken blade of indented quadrilateral section. There is a prominent longitudinal mid-rib on both sides of the spear blade and abraded cutting edges. Approximately one third of the blade has been broken off. The socketed end of the spear measures 15.76mm in diameter. The single side loop towards the base of the socketed end has since broken away. There is a hole on one face of the object in the centre of the of the blade wings at the base, which appears to have been formed through corrosion in antiquity. Much of the original surface has corroded and is lost; however, that which survives has a dark brown patina. The remainder of the object has a mottled dark-mid green patina.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples recorded on the PAS database include: LIN-1CDF13 and DUR-C7E2A6.\n\n\n\nThe overall dimensions are as follows: 86.42mm in length, 22.68mm in width, 18.55mm in thickness and 45.71g in weight.\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n\nDavis R (2017) Later Prehistoric Finds Group Object Datasheet No.5; A Short Guide to Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads","fourFigureLat":"52.57028854","fourFigureLon":"-2.35553637","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.55","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Worfield","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vallnatt/WMIDE3E184.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"86.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
