At the visible end it is 14mm wide and very thin less than 0.25mm thick. It is decorated with a series of seven raised rectangular cross sectioned ridges set within a plain flat border visible on one edge, 2mm wide. The sheet narrows and has probably been trimmed, as where it folds under itself it is 12mm wide and here it has six raised ridges present and the lower one disappears off the edge with no border.\n\n\n\nThe object is possibly a bracelet and is similar to SOM-62CE08 and SF3482 in decoration and its form is similar to IOW-8BBE91 and especially IOW-5A60F3 which has been folded as well. This record notes that sheet gold bracelets of comparable form and dimensions are found Britain and Ireland during the Late Bronze Age (1100-800 BC) as exemplified in the Saintjohns, C. Kildare and Derrinboy, Co. Offaly bracelets in Ireland (Eogan 1994, The Accomplished Art: gold and gold-working in Britain and Ireland during the Bronze Age (c. 2300-650 BC).
