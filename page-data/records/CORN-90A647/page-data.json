There is a raised edge, in the form of a shield, from the stop ridge below onto the top of the blade. The right side of the palstave, from the butt end to the blade end, retains the raised casting seam, but the left side is more corroded and has been marked with an incision, parallel to the remains of the casting seam, running the length of the side of the flange. The shiny surface within this etched line suggests that it is more recent damage that the palstave has sustained. The casting seams are off-centre, like the other palstave found nearby, but the shield shape is longer and more pointed, suggesting that the palstaves were made in different moulds. The surface of the palstave is quite pitted and has many raised circular lumps, which suggests that it has been in a suitably wet or corrosive environment to develop such areas of bronze disease. The palstave is 162 mm in length, the blade end is 52 mm wide and 10 mm thick and the butt end is 20 mm wide and 8 mm thick. The flanged area is 40 mm thick. Crediton type Acton Park phase Middle Bronze Age c.1450-1350 BC Needham (1998) illustrates a similar example on page 128, Fig.29, No.95, which is labelled Acton metalwork. Pearce (1983) illustates similar examples from Truro, Veryan, and Cornwall on pages 579-581, Plates 18-20, Nos.144a, 147b & 165, which are all Crediton types.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"October 03, 2007","datefound2":"October 03, 2007","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"40","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Kew","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/palstave 010.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"162"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
