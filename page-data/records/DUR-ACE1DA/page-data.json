BC 2000 - 1700 ).\n\n\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan, widening to a gently splayed blade. In profile, it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The flat axe head has an overall length of 100.37mm and the axe weighs 142.6 grams. It should be noted that the axe is relatively small when compared to the corpus of known Early Bronze Age material. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 14.57mm with a thickness of 3.8mm. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved.There is no evidence of a median bevel; however, the axe is thickest at the mid point at 8.71mm. The sides of the blade expand to produce a blade edge width of 30.37mm. The blade edge has been damaged through either corrosion or wear.\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe due to corrosion and patina. The axe is a mid green brown colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present.\n\n\n\nThis example is comparable with some of the earliest known copper axe and early bronze axes discovered in Britain.The axehead is likely to date from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age, and is comparable to Migdale axes although not containing all the attributes of the type. Many Migdale axes tend to have narrower butts which flare more at the cutting edge to crescent blades. Examples of similar Migdale axes can be found in Schmidt and Burgess 'The Axes of Scotland and Northern England'.\n\n\n\nThere are similar examples at HESH-ACD6C1, NMGN-4FCA62 and NMGW-89E573.","fourFigureLat":"54.11404727","fourFigureLon":"-1.17544617","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ann Lipscombe","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"January 10, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ann Lipscombe","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.71","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Easingwold","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/annlipscombe/axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"100.37"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
