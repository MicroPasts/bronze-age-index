The fragment has little of the original external surface surviving and the blade edge has been lost. The axe would have been comparatively slender with the sides gently diverging at the blade ends. The blade edge was likely to have been curved. No cast ornament is discernible on the faces.\n\n\n\nThe break has occurred just above the internal socket aperture, revealing the varying thickness of the socket walls, indicating there was core misalignment during casting, which is a common feature of socketed axes.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"\nBreakage of socketed axes above the socket aperture can be observed on numerous other examples from Wales and England, found in both hoards and as single finds. Many fragments such as this display signs of having been deliberately fragmented and it is possible this piece represents the same practice.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Woolaston","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Forest of Dean","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2121.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
