It measures 33.54mm in length, 51.46mm in max.width, 11.42mm in max.thickness and weighs 60.51g.\n\nThe cutting edge is expanded and relatively undamaged, with just some patination-loss at the very edge. The casting flash is not visible, and the side are faceted, giving an eight-sided cross-section at the break.\n\nThe patina is a shiny dark green in colour with fine scratches across the surface, some apparently recent damage and showing a silvery surface beneath.\n\nThe depth of the socket at the break is 2.14mm and the break measures 35.29x11.42mm. In profile, the fragment is triangular in shape.\n\nThe socketed axehead probably belongs to the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park phase of metalworking, c.950-750 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.95851646","fourFigureLon":"-1.17555844","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"December 01, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.42","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Droxford","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-E416A3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"33.54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
