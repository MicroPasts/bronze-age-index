The blade edge and blade tips are rounded, but not flared. The socket mouth has a rectangular internal edge, the exterior forms a asymmetrical rectangle with convex edges, particularly on narrow edge. In profile the axe an elongated triangle. Both profile faces are heavily abraded and no casting seam is visible. One profile face has the remains of a loop. The surface of the axe has an incomplete heavy brown patina, otherwise the surface has a mottled red/green matte patina where the surface is abraded. The axe measures 30.74mm long, 19.78mm wide, 12.02mm thick and weighs 14.2g. The interior of the mouth socket measures 11.86mm long and 7.13mm wide. The socket is 15.18mm deep.\n\n\n\nThe dating of miniature axeheads is from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period, although they are more common from the Roman period. Their function is probably as an amulet or votive. This example is more faithful to Late Bronze Age socketed axeheads than miniature axeheads usually are, and the heavy patina supports this. But Kiernan (Kiernan, P. 2009 Miniature Votive Offerings in the Roman North West Verlag p. 145-7) highlights the possible link between the 're-use of prehistoric axes in Roman period sanctuaries, and the dedication of miniature axes.' He lists Roman sanctuary sites which have produced prehistoric axes, some of which include miniautes axes as Richborough, Nettleton, Wycomb, and Silchester (ibid: 146).","fourFigureLat":"52.27379194","fourFigureLon":"-1.70830692","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"July 02, 2013","datefound2":"October 01, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Claverdon","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-80FB93.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"30.74"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
