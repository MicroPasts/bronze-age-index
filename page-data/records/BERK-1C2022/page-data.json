The object is a thin, tapering flat bar of copper alloy, rectangular in cross section without bevelled edges. At its widest the bar measures 16.5mm wide reducing to 10mm at the opposite end. The widest end has a flared axe-like blade extending to 26.2mm wide with a slight bevel from the bar into the blade on both surfaces. The opposing end of the object, where the bar is narrowest, also has a small flared-edge axe-like blade terminal, bevelled on one side only. This blade measures 13.8mm wide. There is a slight bend about a quarter of the length down the bar behind the largest bladed end. It appears that both ends of this object were designed to be used, probably within the hand without being mounted or hafted into a handle or the like.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects are illustrated in Evans (1881:166), including an object described as a chisel from Plymstock in Devon (figure 190) which is the same length as this example from Southmoor. For comparison a similar, but not exact, object recorded on this database as an early flat axe is LEIC-3F1A93.","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-1001","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"August 15, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2015257.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"104.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
