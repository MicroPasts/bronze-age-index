The upper terminal is swollen with a wide, rounded upper end which is decorated with two parallel incised D-shaped borders. The front of the swollen portion of the body has a central lozenge shaped recess extending from the point at which the two borders meet on the upper edge to midway along the front of the body. The recess is at its widest where the body bends from the rounded top to the front. The sides of the body curve inward slightly as they extend and narrow to form the rounded lower terminal.\n\n\n\nAn integral rectangular attachment loop is present to the reverse of the wide upper terminal and the reverse of the fitting is slightly concaved.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark green patina and is worn. The object is 25.3mm long, 16.3mm wide, 9.8mm thick (17.6mm with attachment loop) and weighs 11.6g.\n\n\n\nThis fitting has features in common with a fairly frequently found yet poorly understood object type currently known simply as 'moustache' or 'moustache-like' objects. See: YORYM-9432BB, LIN-9296A3, WMID-CA9D04 and BH-037A57. Such objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the early Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard. Dr JD Hill (British Museum) suggests that they are Iron Age objects, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.\n\n\n\nSUR-29CED6 and SUR-4F8D51 are more similar to the current example. While both are described as 'a fragment of a moustache object' they appear to be complete.\n\n\n\nA similar date range to that given for 'moustache-like' objects is likely for this object.","fourFigureLat":"53.977196","fourFigureLon":"-0.91894248","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stamford Bridge","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/CW0428.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"25.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
