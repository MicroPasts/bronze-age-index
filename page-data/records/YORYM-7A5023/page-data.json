This is known as a basal-looped spearhead. The blade is now broken into two pieces, roughly half way down with a diagonal break. Most of the outer edge of the blade is abraded, except around the tip where it is complete. The centre of the blade is divided by an expanding (tip to base) lozenge sectioned midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear. Conjoined at the base of the blade are two oval shaped loops. When viewed in profile, the outer edges of the loops (loop plates) are lozenge shaped. The socket is conical in shape, the lower edge of which is slightly damaged and missing a small section. There is remains of wood inside the socket.\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark brown in colour, with an uneven but polished patina. The tip is 98.6 mm long, 33.9 mm wide and 13.9 mm thick at the midrib. The second piece is 172.7 mm long and 39.4 mm wide. The base of the socket is 23.9 mm by 22.5 mm. The tip weighs 57.6 g and both pieces together weigh 191 g.\n\n\n\nMiddle Bronze Age spearheads have been categorised by Davis (2017) and this example falls into Group 8: Incorporated basal looped. He notes that spearheads of the later MBA were generally larger, as well as having loops at the base of the blade. They are dated by associated to the Taunton and Penard phases (1400 BC - 1125 BC).\n\n\n\nFurther examples have also been recorded on the PAS database, including BERK-AAB536, HESH-CB1BF7, SF-54C472 and DENO-DC8D26.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\nDavis, R. 2017 A Short Guide to Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads Later Prehistoric Finds Group: Datasheet 5.","fourFigureLat":"54.02697792","fourFigureLon":"-2.06255101","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Gail Hitchens","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Gail Hitchens","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rylstone","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/PL0119.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"172.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
