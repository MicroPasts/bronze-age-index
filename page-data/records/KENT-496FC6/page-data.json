The cutting edge survives intact, albeit heavily worn. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips flare slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible . The axehead is patinated a mid green and the breaks have lead to more extensive corrosion.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length: 44.49mm, Width: 43.08mm, Thickness: 16.67mm, Weight: 88.92g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Although, due to completeness it is not certain but this axehead probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).","fourFigureLat":"51.23490473","fourFigureLon":"0.33344","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.67","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hadlow","county":"Kent","district":"Tonbridge and Malling","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT496FC6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"44.49"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
