The fragment comprises a section of the upper part of the spearhead. It is trapezoidal in plan, the blade narrowing sharply towards the tip. A high rounded rib runs longitudinally down the centre of both sides. Each terminal ends in a worn break, and exhibits a lozengiform cross section with a pronounced bulge at the rib. At the lower terminal the cross section reveals the end section of the socket within the rib. A green patina is on the surface. The fragment has lost its diagnostic features and is therefore difficult to classify further, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 29mm in length, 25.18mm in width at its widest, 15.52mm in width at its narrowest, 10.57mm in thickness at the mid rib, and weighs 15.5g.\n\n\n\nCf. SWYOR-1F74C1 and SF-C557DC, which states that a high mid rib is more common on Middle Bronze Age spearheads.","fourFigureLat":"53.80352209","fourFigureLon":"-0.6349027","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Denise Wilding","datefound1":"January 01, 2014","datefound2":"December 31, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Denise Wilding","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.57","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hotham","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/denisewilding/YORYM3DA0E4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
