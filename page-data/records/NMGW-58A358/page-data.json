There is a rounded protrusion on the top of the mouth where the mouth is also thicker (at 5.0mm, compared to 3.9mm), possibly the remnants of a casting runner stub, which has been well-finished. One end of the mouth has a slight curve and is likely to be approaching the axe side. The mouth has a lip above a moulding (9mm long), below which the tops of two ribs are evident immediately above the break. The axe is likely to have had three ribs originally. The lip at the mouth is also present on the inside of the socket but no other features are evident inside the socket.  The surface is heavily-pitted with a dark-brown patina. \n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. Axes of Ewart Park tradition are more commonly recovered.","fourFigureLat":"51.29867918","fourFigureLon":"-3.01975314","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Steeple Ashton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017391new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"17.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
