The entire object is evenly pitted on its surface with the pitting varying between 1mm and 4mm in diameter.  The blade end of the axehead is 50mm in length while the haft end is at least 38mm in length.  The butt has worn away, but it can be estimated that the full length of the haft end was 42-45mm, estimated from tapering of the septum.  The flange facets extend out from the septum by 3mm at most.  The stop, separating the blade from the septum, is worn but can be clearly found by touch if not by sight.  The blade does not flare out from the end of the flanges, but continues to follow the straight projection from the haft end.  The cutting edge flares only slightly, and though corroded at one end, the edge is mostly straight rather than curving in a crescent shape.","fourFigureLat":"54.859638","fourFigureLon":"-2.8739","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"March 17, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Cumbria","district":"Carlisle","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/axe top.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"88"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
