The blade flares slightly from the flanges and a very worn stop-ridge, with a crescentic edge at its end. The butt is rounded in profile. In plan view, the flanges are lozengiform, and the axe is probably related to the shield-pattern early types of Long flanged axhead dating from either Acton Park I or II industrial phases of metalwork.\n\n\n\nNote the object has been mounted in a homemade display case and could not be removed; all measurements are approximate.","fourFigureLat":"55.167828","fourFigureLon":"-1.656188","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"This record has been reclassified and dated by Peter Reavill (4/5/21) based on notes from Bronze Age specialist Dr Brendan O'Connor.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"December 04, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"34","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.58","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pegswood","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/NCL-107462.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"111"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
