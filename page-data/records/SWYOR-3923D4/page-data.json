It has flanged parallel sides, the butt end is squared off, with rounded corners, and there is a crescent shaped blade with upturned corners. There is a very shallow stop ridge, now difficult to discern. In side elevation the septum and flanges are in the form of a very slender oval and the outer sides of the flanges are decorated with a moulded, diagonal, ropework pattern that is a characteristic of the Arreton phase. Other than some abrasion around the butt end and some surface chips on one side of the septum and one flange, the axe is in very good condition with a smooth, dark green patina. It is 128.7mm long, 72.3mm wide and 17.2mm thick. It weighs 414gm.\n\n\n\nOther axeheads of this type are recorded on the database: see for example references LANCUM-19A734 and LANCUM-EFEAC0. Axes of this type are also illustrated in Megaw and Simpson, 1981, Introduction to British Prehistory, figure 2.29, numbers 5 and 6","fourFigureLat":"53.75735063","fourFigureLon":"-2.04698089","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"December 01, 2015","datefound2":"December 31, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jack Coulthard","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Heptonstall","county":"Calderdale","district":"Calderdale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2842_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"128.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
