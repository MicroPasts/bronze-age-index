The axehead is a Later Short Flanged axehead of Type Lissett. The axehead has a narrow rectangular-sectioned body that widens and flattens at one end into a curved cutting edge. The other end flattens into a blunt edge. A pair of lozenge-shaped flanges are present on either side of the butt end. The object is light brown in colour with a patchy green patina. It is 156.0mm in length, 66.5mm in width and 36.5mm in thickness. It weighs 474g.\n\n\n\nThis type of axehead is common in East Yorkshire but have been found in the Fylde, so the findspot is in keeping with the general distribution. This is quite a large, common group and part of the Taunton Metalwork Assemblage, dating from c. 1300 - 1200 BC.\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K. and Burgess, C. 1981, nos. 605-666, especially nos. 616-620.","fourFigureLat":"53.95236679","fourFigureLon":"-2.80909897","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss.
