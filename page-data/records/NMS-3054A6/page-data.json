The lateral&nbsp;edges&nbsp;are broadly straight and parallel for the most part, towards one end these begin to taper convexly before terminating at an old break, apparently a few millimetres before the original pointed tip. There is some loss of one of the&nbsp;edges here, due to an old&nbsp;break.\nThe other end appears to be an old break too and there is minimal tapering in width as rapier blades often are. Cross-section&nbsp;is a wide, narrow lozenge, each face bearing two equally-sized facets divided by a rounded longitudinal arris. It is broadly uniform in thickness,&nbsp;tapering towards the point. c. 1,600&nbsp;to 1,000&nbsp;B.C.\n\nLength: 38.7mm. Width: 13.7mm. Thickness: 2.9mm.
