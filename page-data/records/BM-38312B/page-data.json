The location is approximately 2 kilometres SW of another the LBA hoard found in the 1990s. \n\n\n\n     The find was reported to a local historian, who recorded the axehead. Subsequently this gentleman facilitated the donation of the axehead to Colchester Museum, which acquired it in 1961, accession no. 280.61. The museum has since lost the find.\n\n\n\n     At some time in the 1990s, the historian directed a local metal detectorist, to the location and with the consent of the landowner a metal detector search was made of the area. A further complete axehead together with several fragmentary ones and a number of ingot pieces were consequently recovered. Subsequently the detectorist died, and no further searching of the field was carried out. It is however believed that treasure hunters also accessed this field, and thus it is probable that diagnostic metalwork has been removed without record.\n\n\n\n     Of the pieces that do survive, and which are detailed in the following catalogue, it is clear that the find represents another of the now ubiquitous Ewart Park Phase scrap hoards. It should be noted that the material as shown to the writer was loose in a box with other metal detector finds, and with nothing to indicate the original association of any of the finds. All that were clearly or apparently of LBA date were outsorted, but it follows that the items illustrated are only presumed to be associated and a part of the same deposit. \n\n\n\n\n\nLBA Hoard Catalogue, Earlier Finds\n\n\n\n\n\n001. Axehead, socketed with loop. 140g.* 111x48x32. Plain mouth, slight chamfer to edge with vestige of casting flash on top of rim. Slight horizontal moulding coinciding with loop top. Upper body of slightly rounded octagonal section. The blade is asymmetrical, with one tip being some 5mm higher than the other. The middle section of the blade is blunted, possibly in antiquity. Both casting seams are evident, and are amplified by the mould halves having been slightly offset. Cf Schmidt & Burgess 1981 ‘Meldreth’ type.\n\n\n\n002. Axehead, socketed with loop (upper section only). 104.61g. 50x42x36. Mouth with rounded moulding, two narrow horizontal mouldings below coinciding with the loop top. Two indents are evident in the inner rim at 12 and 3 o’clock, and possibly corresponding characteristics at 6 and 9. Both casting seams evident. The axehead has been broken by repeated blows to the mid-body section on both sides, using an implement that has produced round impact pits of 3-4mm width.\n\n\n\n003. Axehead, socketed (upper body fragment). Probably looped. 46.61g. 70x44x9. Mouth with narrow rounded moulding, two narrow horizontal mouldings below. Two moulded opposed crescents below. Horizontal moulded cross rib on internal face 62mm below top. The axehead has been subjected to heavy crushing impacts to the rim resulting in cracking and flattening.\n\n\n\n004. Axehead, socketed (upper body fragment). Probably looped. 23.01g. 68x24x13. Mouth with rounded moulding, rounded horizontal moulding below. Narrow casting seam amplified by slight offset of moulds.\n\n\n\n005. Uncertain object (fragment). 16.38g. 27x25x17. Square section with hole in one face, probably a casting flaw. Patination consistent with other items in the group, so presumed to be associated.\n\n\n\n006. Ingot (fragment). 245g.* 58x38x28. From a plano-convex ingot.\n\n\n\n007. Ingot (fragment). 210g.* 52x38x24. Probably from a plano-convex ingot. One surface is heavily pitted, deriving presumably from an aspect of the casting process.\n\n\n\n008. Ingot (fragment). 55.01g. 33x22x22. Possibly from a plano-convex ingot.\n\n\n\n009. Ingot (fragment). 28.29g. 32x25x11. Rim section of a small plano-convex ingot.\n\n\n\n010. Ingot (fragment). 22.74g. 27x25x14. Rim section of a plano-convex ingot.\n\n\n\n\n\n*To nearest 5g.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mike Cuddeford","datefound1":"August 31, 2003","datefound2":"September 30, 2003","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"12","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aythorpe Roding","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mrainbow/00075000_001.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
