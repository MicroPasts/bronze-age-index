The low flanges are worn to the point they are barely discernable  From this point the body of the axe (the septum) thickens regularly to a point just further than half way along its length (c.45 mm from the butt). At this point there is a shallow, almost imperceptible, thickened ridge, which may indicate the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. \n\n\n\nAfter the proto stop-ridge the body of the axe thin gradually to the blade edge of the axe. Concurrently the body of the axehead widens in a smooth curve so that the wings at the side of the axeblade are almost perpendicular to the body of the axe. The blade edge itself is crescent shaped and slightly more angled than the narrowing body. One corner has been damaged. The blade edge is slightly bevelled indicating it has been sharpened at least once. The surface of the axehead is heavily patinated and surfacely pitted. It has a mottled dark green through to light grey-green colouration\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 99.39mm long, 50.82mm wide (at blade end, 23.1mm wide at mid point, 17.82mm wide at butt end), 12.67mm thick and 156.59g in weight\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This is a low flanged axe of Early Bronze Age date. The lack of developed stop ridge suggests it most likely dates to the later stages of the Early Bronze Age. Needham (1983, 2017) has produced a typology of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age flat and flanged axeheads that defines them based on the ratios of their physical form (Needham 2017, 4, Table 1). This axe meets all the criteria for a Type 4e Axehead and most closely corresponds to a Type 4E Withington form (Needham, 2017, 27-29, 55-56). Needham places the date of this type of axe to between the 20th and 18th centuries cal BC c. 1900-1700 cal BC (ibid 45, fig 16).\n\n\n\nThese axes are traditionally assigned to the Long Flanged or Developed Flat Axe of Aylesford type (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) that fit with Burgess’ metalworking tradition phase IV, and corresponds to Needham’s (1996) Period 3 (circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC)\n\n\n\nSimilarly formed examples on the database include  SOM-90B762, LVPL-AC4D8B, SF-003BC7 and DEV-987893.","fourFigureLat":"51.3290871","fourFigureLon":"-1.51339841","fromdate":"-2050","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"November 17, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.67","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Buttermere","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTA2BA81b.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"99.39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
