The object is sub triangular in form and ovoid in cross section and is of Barbed and Tanged form. The upper end of the object is pointed, while the lower end has a rectangular central tang, which is flanked by one complete and one partial barb. The space between the tang and barbs is semi-circular. There is a central shallow rib running longitudinally on both the upper and lower surfaces. The outer edges are slightly bevelled. \n\n\n\nLength: 34.41mm, Width: 22.35mm, Thickness: 3.05mm, Weight: 4.4g\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark brown in colour with a pitted patina. \n\n\n\nA similar arrowhead is recorded in database record SUR-D9AFD8, where Dr Simon Maslin notes:\n\n\n\nBronze Age flat barbed and tanged copper-alloy arrowheads are known from Britain, though they are rare finds. Other examples on the database include SWYOR-3A2CF7, NMS-B061B6, NMS-F982A3, WMID-CE6A76, NARC-F9B223, LEIC-13A0FE, NMS-477E93 and SF6680. This appears to be the fourth recorded example from Wiltshire.\n\n\n\nIn contrast there is only one example known from a secure British Bronze Age archaeological context (the Penard hoard, Archaeologica 71, page 138). At the time of its discovery, it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import on the basis of a range of previous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France. PAS recorded finds have since demonstrated that these bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age, the Penard find was dated to 1275-1140 BC, suggesting at least a Middle Bronze Age date for copper alloy examples such as this one.","fourFigureLat":"52.09514038","fourFigureLon":"0.01308184","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Meldreth","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"South Cambridgeshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC7ED438.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"34.41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
