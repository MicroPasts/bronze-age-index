It is comparatively small with a markedly slender butt, which nonetheless thickens at the septum. This is possibly a proto-stop ridge, as there is a particular horizontal thickening in this area. Both faces show signs of pitting, with some circular areas a deeper green than the consistently dark green surface elsewhere. There is a shallow U-shaped depression in the cutting edge which may have occurred during use. \n\n\n\nSimilar examples, albeit with a slightly longer butt, include SOM-90B762 (from the south west), KENT-A2BA81 and NMGW-084887, the latter of which has slightly more exaggerated bevelling.  DEV-987893 is a further local fragmentary example. The record for SOM-90B762 provides an extended interpretation:\n\n\n\nThis is a low flanged axe of Early Bronze Age date. The lack of developed stop ridge suggests it most likely dates to the later stages of the Early Bronze Age. Needham (1983, 2017) has produced a typology of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age flat and flanged axeheads that defines them based on the ratios of their physical form (Needham 2017, 4, Table 1). This axe meets all the criteria for a Type 4e Axehead and most closely corresponds to a Type 4E Withington form (Needham, 2017, 27-29, 55-56). Needham places the date of this type of axe to between the 20th and 18th centuries cal BC c. 1900-1700 cal BC (ibid 45, fig 16).\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 66.3mm length,  19.4mm width (butt), 39.2mm width (blade), 5.3mm thickness (butt), 8.9mm thickness (proto-stop), 1.9mm thickness (blade edge), weight 68.7g.","fourFigureLat":"50.71439747","fourFigureLon":"-2.99285344","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"April 30, 2020","datefound2":"September 25, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Combpyne Rousdon","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV4418E9fix.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"66.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
