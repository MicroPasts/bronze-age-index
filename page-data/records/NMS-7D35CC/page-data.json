The socketed end has a single raised collar with broadly square-shaped (externally 23.7mm x 23.3mm) socket and tapers slightly to a more rectangular shaped head (17.7mm x 21.7mm) which has been slightly upset through use. The overall length of the head is 64 mm with a socket depth of approximately 44 mm providing a 20 mm long solid bronze striking section. Both casting seams have been removed and only a scant trace on one side is evident. The dark green to brown patina is largely complete save small eroded areas around the mouth of the socket that reveal an underlying light green colour. Similar types of hammer can be found at - IOW-8B13A7 & IOW-A05DE6 on this database. Circa 1000-700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.72520219","fourFigureLon":"0.8565404","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"Note: This object was found in the same field as another possible Bronze Age artefact (NMS-7DE817 at around 250yd separation). However, it has not been possible to definitively date this other object to the same period and accordingly the two have not been declared as treasure. If further Bronze Age artefacts come to light in the immediate vicinity the new finds will have to be considered as potential treasure.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"January 01, 2011","datefound2":"October 25, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mileham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/64045_7D35CC_LBA_Hammer.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"64"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
