The axe has a narrow, thinning butt with moderately concave sides. It is undecorated. The metal has a dark green/brown patina and is worn.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is 46.31 mm long, 14.15 mm wide tapering to 6.40 mm wide, 2.88 mm thick and weighs 5.75g.\n\n\n\nThis object is too small to have functioned as an axe and current archaeological thinking suggests they played a role in votive/ritual practices or functioned as amulets. Despite the obvious lack of contemporaneity, those modelled on later Bronze Age axe types, socketed and looped, have been found in secure Iron Age and Roman contexts.","fourFigureLat":"53.31723699","fourFigureLon":"-0.56039678","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lisa Brundle","datefound1":"September 01, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lisa Brundle","gridSource":"GPS (From FLO)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.88","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cammeringham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/LIN0BCEC7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46.31"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
