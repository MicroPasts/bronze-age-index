Needham (1996) grouped Acton 2 metalwork with Taunton and Penard as his Period 5 (c. 1500-1150BC), It could be suggested that this example falls in the earlier section of this date range.\n\nThe palstave is complete, but has lost much of the original surface, particularly on one face. The butt is straight and meets the sides at a right-angle. The sides are parallel as far as the stop, and then gently diverge and turn out sharply at the blade tips. The flanges are curved and define a pointed oval with the blade sides. Both sides exhibit the remnants of prominent broad casting flashes and one of the flanges has a prominent casting flaw. The blade edge is deeply curved. The septum is slightly rounded, and unusually, the stop is different on each face. The face with more of the surface surviving has a straight stop, which meets the flange facets in a right-angle, while the other face has a rounded U-shaped stop. The better preserved face has the suggestion of a very slight poorly defined mid-rib. The blade faces are flat with no working up at the sides, but have a slight depression before the blade facet. The blade is notably asymmetrical, with one blade tip positioned further back than the other. It is possible this may be the result of differential wear on the blade through use.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"This example can be best paralleled with numbers 795-6 (pp 127, plate 58) in Scmidt & Burgess' catalogue (1981).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Abergavenny","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2157.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"153"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
