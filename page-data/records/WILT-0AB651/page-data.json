The butt end of the palstave is missing, with only the blade surviving between the stop ridge and cutting edge. The sides of the blade are roughly concave, flairing outwards towards the cutting edge, which is fairly straight and does not have flaring wing tips. The stop ridge is sub-square in cross section, measuring 22.3mm by 20.6mm, transitioning into a sub-rectangular cross section at the blade. There is a shield shaped depression on either face of the blade, with a central reserved rib, which is continuous with a midrib running down the centre of the blade. There is a possible scar from a lost loop on one side below the stop ridge, however due to abrasion this is tentative. \n\n\n\nLength: 80.6mm; Maximum width of blade: 41.4mm; Minimum width: 22.4mm; Maximum thickness: 20.6mm; Minimum thickness: 6.8mm; weight 177.62g.","fourFigureLat":"50.9250398","fourFigureLon":"-1.6883584","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alix Smith","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alix Smith","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bramshaw","county":"Hampshire","district":"New Forest","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridge/WILT0AB651.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"80.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
