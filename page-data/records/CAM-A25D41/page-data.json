The fragment comprises the lower blade and cutting edge. It is semicircular in plan and wedge-shaped in profile. The cutting edge is expanded. Nothing of the original cutting edge or blade tips remain due to wear and corrosion damage. There is an oblong aperture at the top of the fragment, which represents the very end of the socket. The surface of the axe is damaged, but it survives mostly intact with a dark brown patina with patches of green. The fragment is 28mm long, 46mm wide from tip to tip, 30mm wide at the socketed end and 14mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"52.167516","fourFigureLon":"-0.012899","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philippa Walton","datefound1":"February 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philippa Walton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Eversden","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"South Cambridgeshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pjw/bronzeageaxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
