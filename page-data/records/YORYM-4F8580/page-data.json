Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in shape and lozenge in section. A central rib is present on both faces of the spear extending from the pointed tip to the lozenge terminal end. The blade extends either side of the midrib terminating in abraded edges. The inner portion of the spear head is hollow, in which a wooden shaft would have been fitted. Although insufficient remains to have complete confidence in classifying this object, as the midrib extends to the tip, it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 5-11, while its section is possibly most indicative of the Late Bronze Age pegged types, Davis Group 11.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-green patina and is worn. The spear head is 46.4mm long, 27.3mm wide, 9.2mm thick and weighs 16.1g.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects recorded on the database are: YORYM-17F9E2 and YORYM-A2E2F3.b","fourFigureLat":"53.87155541","fourFigureLon":"-0.32848763","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss.
