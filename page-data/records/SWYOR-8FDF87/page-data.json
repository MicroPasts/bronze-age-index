It has a shield-shaped depression on the blade beneath the stop on both faces. It has a raised rounded stop ridge between the flanges which are quite high, giving a roughly diamond shape to the side of the body of the palstave. The butt end is missing. The cutting edge is crescent shaped. The casting spur is visible on both sides. The axe is 140.4mm long, 55.1mm wide and 35.6mm thick. It probably belongs to the Acton Park period of metalworking (Needham 2004 unpub.) and dates from between 1500BC and 1150BC. There is a hole in the stop, between the flanges which may suggest that the axehead is hollow. The axe is suffering from serious corrosion and pitting, but has a glossy deep green patina where it is not damaged. Similar axes can be seen on the PAS database. One example is SOM-1E8616.","fourFigureLat":"53.71048992","fourFigureLon":"-1.31971117","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"October 14, 2003","datefound2":"October 14, 2003","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"35.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Airedale and Ferry Fryston","county":"Wakefield","district":"Wakefield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 404 palstave.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"140.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
