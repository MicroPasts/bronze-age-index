The mouth is circular (with a diameter of 20.5mm) with no mouth mouldings. The gouge flares outwards slightly to the mouth (with a diameter beneath the mouth of 18mm). Beneath the flaring mouth, the sides of the gouge are straight and slightly convergent (producing a blade width of 15.4mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been carefully finished, probably by hammering. The blade comprises a shallow U-shaped depression (beginning 43mm from the current blade edge), which is filled with prominent striations running along the channel from top to bottom. The striations are unlikely to be purely from sharpening and possibly are partly decorative. The blade edge has been lost but does not appear to be expanded. There is a groove running diagonally from the mouth to the side of the blade, which has appears to have some patination internally, suggesting that it may be damage from antiquity or a possibly a flaw in the mould. The surface has a dark green patina where it survives and elsewhere is pale green. The colour of the patina has been altered by a recent oily coating by the finder.\n\n\nSavory (1980, p 55)suggests that the earliest socketed gouges such as  those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings,  whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar.","fourFigureLat":"51.392659","fourFigureLon":"-3.481784","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 23, 2009","datefound2":"July 08, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantwit Major","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2009.188.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"77.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
