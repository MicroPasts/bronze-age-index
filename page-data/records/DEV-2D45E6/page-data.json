The axehead is largely complete, but with extensive damage to the mouth of the socket. The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan and tapers in profile towarss the cutting edge. A pronounced casting seam runs down either lateral face, creating a shallow sub-hexagonal cross section, The vestigial remains of a probable loop survive on the less complete lateral face. The less abraded broad face is decorated with a series of three slightly converging longitudinal ribs. The cutting edge is flat. The mouth of the socket is expanded into a slightly flaring collar, with two of what was originally four casting runner stubs present; one at the centre of each surviving side. The socket is sub-rectangular in cross-section, and is 50.8mm deep.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 78.3mm; width 34.2mm; thickness 23.3mm; weight 74.56g.","fourFigureLat":"50.4543204","fourFigureLon":"-3.70583176","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"Similar axeheads can be seen published by Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2014: nos. 54 & 432).
