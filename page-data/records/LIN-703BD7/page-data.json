The awl is elongated and has four broadly rectangular facets tapering slightly to both ends. It is almost square in cross section and its widest point is approximately at the centre of it. One of the end has a pointed tip, circular in cross-section and probably used to pierce leather and similar materials. The other end is flat and sub-rectangular in cross section. The awl is smooth, udecorated and covered with a green patina. It measures 47.15 mm in length, 6.43 mm in width, 3.02  mm thick and weighs 4.88g.\n\n\n\nA similar awl is illustrated in Read B. (2001), p. 94, no. 694.
