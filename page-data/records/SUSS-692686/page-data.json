The tool is a square sectioned rod which narrows and slightly thins to a rectangular section at the ends. One end narrows to a diagonal blade, the other is broken (the break is patinated) but is also narrowing to a blade or curved end. \nMany Bronze Age awls have been found in excavations and by detectorists, they tend to have a square section in the middle but normally narrow more sharply than this example and have circular sectioned terminals, or one circular sectioned end to allow them to be turned during use (see, for example, the selection published in Piggott (1964), p.113). It is not clear this example would work as an awl without that circular section but it could be some other woodworking or engraving tool of Bronze Age or later date.\nIt is 95.6mm long, 4.4mm wide and 4.3mm thick in the centre, 3.7mm wide at the complete end. It weighs 10.33 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.541347","fourFigureLon":"-0.349975","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"July 31, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chesterton","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"Huntingdonshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lburnett/SUSS-692686.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"95.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
