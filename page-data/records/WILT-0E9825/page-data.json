The spear consists of a triangular-shaped blade, which tapers towards the tip. The blade has beveled blade wings, with one cutting-edge complete with minor damage, while the other is missing fragments of the edge due to old damage. The blade wings extend from the socket at a right angle. The blade has a circular cross-sectioned mid-rib which gradually widens towards the base of the blade to form the socket. The mid-rib has bordering moulded grooves on both sides of the blade. \n\n\n\nOn one side of the socket, approximately 18.0 mm below the edge of the blade is a sub-triangular peghole, which is approximately 6.5 mm in length. The spear measures 194.0 mm in length, 32.8 mm wide, 21.4 mm in diameter at the socket, 3.3 mm wall thickness at the socket and weighs 147.07 g.\n\n\n\nPegged spearheads are very varied and the blades are frequently leaf-shaped, with one or two pegholes. An incomplete spear with a comparable blade is recorded on the database as LIN-E2B925.","fourFigureLat":"51.12326854","fourFigureLon":"-2.05853319","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Chestnutt","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Chestnutt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"21.4","edge":null,"thickness":"3.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stockton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT0E9825.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"194"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
