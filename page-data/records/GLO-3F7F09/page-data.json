To the side of the wider end is a hole 9mm long by 5mm wide. The wider body of the object has fine latitudinal lines the run around its circumference with only the pointed tip remaining undecorated.\n\n\nThese moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples such as this item while others are 'double' see YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45 and BH-AA1CBE.\n\n\n\nIn the case of double examples there is normally an open area at the centre of the object suggesting it was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.","fourFigureLat":"50.92376814","fourFigureLon":"-2.62738266","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"May 31, 2017","datefound2":"November 01, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barwick","county":"Somerset","district":"South Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO3F7F09.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"22"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
