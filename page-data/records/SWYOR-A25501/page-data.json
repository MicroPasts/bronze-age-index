It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham&#39;s Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150&nbsp;BC). The spear head is probably Davis&nbsp;group 6.\n\nThe spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces, triangular in cross-section, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. There is some damage to the edges of the blade and no edge bevels are discernable. The upper blade edges are concave. The spearhead is broken just below the widest point of the blade, so the socket is missing. The spear has a smooth dark brown patina.\n\nCompare WMID-56E2E4 and see also Davis, R (2017) A Short Guide to early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads.
