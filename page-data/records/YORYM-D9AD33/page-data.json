The axehead is wedge shaped with a sub-square socket, the mouth has been lost to old worn breaks. Internally the socket tapers and narrows to the cutting edge. Externally the axehead tapers and narrows along the body before expanding into the blade and cutting edge which flares towards each blade tip. Much of one surface is damaged, broken and worn. A D-shaped, ovate sectioned attachment loop is present to one side, below the mouth and casting flashes are present on both sides of the axehead including the loop. The surviving face appears to have faint traces of three worn short and narrow ribs.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-green patina and is worn. The axehead is 83.3mm long, the remaining socket has an external diameter of 24mm x 27.2mm and is 3.5mm thick, the blade is 45.5mm wide. The axehead weighs 122g.\n\n\n\nThree ribbed Yorkshire type axes are a well-known part of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage of the British Late Bronze Age. In Yorkshire, many hundreds of these axes have been found as single finds as well as in hoards.","fourFigureLat":"53.7898389","fourFigureLon":"-0.27101477","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bilton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/RO0086.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"83.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
