The axehead has curved, diverging sides with a curved and splayed cutting edge. The axe has a rectangular profile and is 16.4mm wide at the break. There is a slight curve to the side profile of the body of the axe which suggests it had become slightly bent, perhaps in use and perhaps leading to the breakage.","fourFigureLat":"51.12211491","fourFigureLon":"-0.45820206","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cranleigh","county":"Surrey","district":"Waverley","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR0A7938.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"46.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
