The looped head is mostly missing, with only two short stumps surviving. These are thin and rectangular in cross-section: flat on the internal and external edges of the loop. However, there is a concave bevelled constriction in the middle of both sides, just above the junction with the shank (best viewed from the top).\n\nThe shank is oval in cross-section and emerges from the head with a significant concave taper over the first five millimetres of its length. Over approximately this same distance, the longest axis of the oval cross-section is parallel with the plane of the head. After that, the taper is much more subtle and the shank twists so that its long axis is oblique to the plane of the head. It maintains this orientation and taper throughout the rest of its length. The tip is blunt and probably represents a worn break. There is a slight bend in the shank, at just over halfway along its extant length from the head. Most of the shank has a dark green patina, becoming dark brown near and on the stumps of the head. See NMS-3D6677 on this database for a more complete example. c.1400-1250 BC.\n\n\n\nLength: 73.9mm.
