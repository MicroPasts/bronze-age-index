In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.89 MM (thickness: 1.49 MM). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The long edges bear slight evidence that they have been raised to form flanges. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.73 MM). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.41 MM. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. Minor traces of oblique slash marks has been noted on the flanged edges, under a microscope magnification. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.\n\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.\n\n\nIt measures 84.19 MM in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.41 MM, width at the butt is 12.89 MM and it has a maximum thickness of 9.73 MM. It weighs 70.2 grams.\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). \n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\nReference:\n\n\nNeedham, S.
