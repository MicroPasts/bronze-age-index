BC 2500 - BC 2050\n\n\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid in shape. The butt is relatively thin having a flat edge, the butt has been broken. The patina at the break matches with the rest of the axe suggesting the break occurred in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge). However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.5 mm). The sides of the blade expand slightly to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 62.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. The blade facet has been heavily abraded and is virtually no longer visible, however the top and bottom of the blade do slope gently down to the edge. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. \n\n\n\nThe object measures 86.2 mm in length. The width at the butt is 45.4 mm, the centre is 51.5 mm wide and the blade is 62.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 6.9 mm, the centre is 9.5 mm thick and the blade is 5.3 mm thick. The axehead weighs 252.1 g. \n\n\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark brown in colour with a much abraded or corroded patina. Traces of a light green patina, suggesting corrosion products. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of most of the original surface detail. \n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age (or possibly even the Copper Age). This example fits best into the copper axes and early bronze axes. The form of the axe is comparable to Type Castletown Roche/Pitlochry (outlined by Schmidt and Burgess p 22-23, Plate 1, No 5). These axes fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Similar axeheads have also been recorded on the database including HESH-ACD6C1, HESH-84D8A5 and LANCUM-AA5ED7. \n\n\n\nRef: \n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C.B. 1981.
