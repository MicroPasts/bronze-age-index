Weight 22.8g. \n\n\n\nThis is the lower blade side and upper socket side of a bronze socketed spearhead. The blade edge has a defined bevel approximately 5mm wide. The interior of the blade is slightly hollowed out immediately adjacent to where the central and circular rib cavity once existed. The blade edge merges with the socket with a shallow and gradual angle, with no nick or break of slope. The even convex curve of the lower blade suggests the spearhead once had a leaf or flame shaped form. The fragment has a dark brown patina and appears to have been coated with oil since discovery.\n\n\n\nSingle-runner casting jet \n\n\n\nMaximum top surface length 33.8mm; maximum top surface width 26.8mm; depth 23.1mm; length of runner near break 15.4mm; width runner near break 3.9mm. Weight 50.7g. \n\n\n\nThis is a single-runner bronze casting jet, oval in plan, with a rough and uneven tope surface. One underside long axis has a near straight profile with a lower inward tapering step, while the opposing side is more steeply undercut, with a slightly concave profile. The underside break is worn and eroded, making it difficult to establish the original dimensions of the casting runner with any precision. The patina is dark green with lighter green edges and breaks.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"The plain pegged spearhead fragment can be confidently identified as of Middle to Late Bronze Age date and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). The shape of the surviving blade edge is consistent with either a leaf shaped or flame shaped blade. In Wales, early examples of similar plain pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 950-800BC. In Wales, there are eleven other known hoards of Ewart Park date which included plain pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen (Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (all Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; 2008; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick unpublished; Gwilt et al, in prep). The wooden hafts of a number of plain pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to this period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, on a balance of probability, this spearhead is thought most likely to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 950BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nCasting jets only become common discoveries within hoard associations during the Late Bronze Age. These are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date (950-800BC), with thirteen other hoards of secure Ewart Park date from Wales now known to include them: the Penwyllt (Powys), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Penarth, Cowbridge, St Nicholas, Llancarfan, Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), St Mellons (Cardiff), Glascoed and Llangybi (both Monmouthshire) hoards (Savory 1980, 120-22, Cats. 274, 281 284; Stanton 1984; Gwilt, 2004, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 & 4; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished; Gwilt et al, unpublished; Gwilt et al, in prep). Therefore, on a balance of probability, the casting jet is thought most likely to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (950-800BC).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarise, plain pegged spearheads and casting jets are contemporary in their dating to between 1020-800BC, during the Blackmoor and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age, although a Ewart Park date (950-800BC) is the most likely, on a balance of probability.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBarnwell, E.L.
