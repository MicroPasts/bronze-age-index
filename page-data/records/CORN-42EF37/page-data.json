The socketed collar is missing and the blade end has been hammered flat so that is has flanged outwards slightly on both sides. The casting seam on both sides has been filed down, and there are now lumps of corrosion product following these lines which obscure the detail. The surface is generally corroded and pitted with patches of powdery bright green bronze disease.\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar socketed chisel from Bodmin, Cornwall on page 563, Plate 2, No.12 and another from Bovey Tracey, Devon on page 585, Plate 24, No.191, which is dated to the Taunton-Penard phases.\n\n\nNeedham and Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar example of a socketed chisel on page 132, Fig.34, No.175, which is referred to as Penard metalwork.\n\n\nLate Middle Bronze Age.
