The fragment is rectangular in plan and triangular, or wedge shaped, in section. The outer edge of the blade fragment flattens to a sharp edge, whilst the inner edge widens to a broken edge. Both the top and bottom of the blade fragment are broken. It seems likely this is a fragment of a triangular blade possibly from a spear head which would widen to a central prominent rib. \n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-green patina. The object is 39.6mm long, 12.5mm wide, 5.3mm thick and weighs 6.1g.\n\n\n\nAlthough the object is relatively undiagnostic, its shape and association with other Bronze Age spear head fragments suggests it is of this date and type. Davis (2017) has classified spearheads of the Early to Late Bronze Age, and whilst this fragment does not suggest a type, if it is from a spearhead it would date from about 1700 - 800 BC.
