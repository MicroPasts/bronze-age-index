The original record was made 18 years ago on the original PAS database.\n\n\n\n\n\nA cast copper alloy short-flanged axehead of Middle Bronze Age date (1600-1250 BC). Unfortunately there is only one view of the axe making the form difficult to be identify specifically to a type or sub-type. The blade is worn and crescentic in shape and the upper blade has a shield pattern directly below the relatively prominent stopridge. This stop ridge is not fused to the side flanges which project slightly beyond the stop and are curled. The butt is squared off with a broken edge. Although the type is difficult to suggest given the presence of a shield pattern it is most likely to be from among the earlier types of flanged axehead, perhaps Cragg Wood dated to the period 1600-1400 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, nos. 462-82) - being attributed to either Acton Park I or Acton Park II metal working assemblages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal record:\n\n\n\nUnlooped, shield pattern palstave with high flanges and stop ridge\n\n\n\nWidth of blade 65mm.","fourFigureLat":"54.177236","fourFigureLon":"-2.782842","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Nick Herepath","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Nick Herepath","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Yealand Redmayne","county":"Lancashire","district":"Lancaster","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/nherepath/2230b.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Liverpool","length":"148"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
