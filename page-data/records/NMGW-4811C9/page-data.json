The butt is flat-topped, slightly angled (23.0mm wide and 1.8mm thick). There are two rivet notches beneath the butt and on the sides (of 8.5mm diameter, with their midpoints 9.6mm beneath the butt and giving a minimum butt width of 17.5mm). There is no clear hilt mark but there is the suggestion of a curving mark from the top of the blade on the sides and arcing down onto the midrib. Beneath the rivet notches, the sides of the butt are straight and near parallel (with a width of 10.2mm where the butt has a thickness of 4.6mm), before converging at the top of the blade (with a width of 17mm and where the dirk has a maximum thickness of 5.0mm). The sides of the blade are near-straight and gradually convergent before narrowing to the tip. The blade has a flattened mid-section rib (6.5mm wide). The blade facets are concave (4mm - 6mm wide) and the original blade edge is eroded and now lost. There is differential wear on one side, above the tip (for approximately 10cm above the tip). The dirk has a black patina, well preserved over much of the blade but lost at the position of the interior bend, perhaps suggesting the damage to the blade occurred post-deposition. Otherwise the blade has a grey-green to pale-brown corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe weapon is of Group IV and the hilt form and blade profile would suggest a Type Appleby dirk, as defined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p. 74)[1]. The rectangular form to the butt with upright sides would further suggest 'Variant Barnes' (ibid. p 76-7) of Type Appleby. However it is unclear whether the notches are cast into the hilt or the weapon was damaged and reworked from rivet holes. If the notches were original, then it may suggest a slightly later weapon of Type Stuntey, or similar, although these types often have more trapezoidal butt forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Burgess C.B. & Gerloff S., 1981; The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IV.
