The object has an oval socket which has a slightly expanded rim.  The oval profile of the socket narrows the further it extends into the main blade, becoming flat approximately 10mm short of the top.  The sides of the socket are slightly concave and lead into the main body of the spear.  The edges are very worn and appear not to reflect the objects original profile.  The blade edges flare downwards and outwards from the socket in a 'mushroom' shape.  The surface of the object is covered in a very thick layer of greyish mineralised deposit that also covers the inside of the socket as far as is visible.  There is a small area where the surface patina has come off on one side of the socket in between the line of the blade beginnings.  This area reveals two moulded decorative bands set horizontally around the socket.  \n\nThis object was discovered lying ontop of another object, recorded on the Portable Antiquities database as LIN-43C802.  This other object is also of uncertain date and function, however it does not display the same surface patina as the ?spear.\n\nThe external dimensions of the socket measure 41mm by 18mm, whilst the internal measure 30mm by 12mm.  The length of socket to the start of the blade is 35mm.  The blade width at its widest is 20mm.\n\nThe object is similar in some ways to Later Bronze Age tools, such as spears and chisels, although most of these have circular sockets.  oval sockets are seen on some Irish Bronze Age metalwork, however the form, relative thinness and 'tinny' feel to these two items suggests a much later date.\n\nThese two items were shown to the British Museum for identification and as potential Treasure, however their verdict was that they were not prehistoric in date.","fourFigureLat":"52.632606","fourFigureLon":"-0.449981","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"1699","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barnack","county":"City of Peterborough","district":"City of Peterborough","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN-436A46.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"98"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
