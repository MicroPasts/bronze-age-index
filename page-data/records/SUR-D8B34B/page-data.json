The object comprises a short arc which merges into a straight section, with a swelling where the two lengths join. The lower side of the swelling and the two present terminals all have pronounced hollows each of which is orientated along the length of the object. Both terminals expand. The curving length appears plain but is corroded and is possibly decorated with a line of dots. The straight length is decorated on three sides with a band of repeating punched linear curving indentations. The central swelling is decorated on one side with cast raised concentric circles; the opposite side is plain and flat. A short ridge on the inner face of this swelling separates it from the curved end.","fourFigureLat":"52.12088171","fourFigureLon":"-1.68009422","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Margaret Broomfield","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whitchurch","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/15778.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"49.18"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
