The fragment is the blade end including the base of the socketed area. It is trapezoidal in shape with a worn cutting edge and flared rounded corners. The cross-section is a tapering rectangle which is broken to the wider end. The breaks are old and worn.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark brownish-green patina and is worn. The fragment is 31.9mm long, 47.8mm wide, 15.1mm thick and weighs 54.5g.\n\n\n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.88617948","fourFigureLon":"-0.79957483","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bielby","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/SHo0211.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"31.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
