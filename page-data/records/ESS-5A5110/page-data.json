This object is subrectangular in plan and flat in section. One end is 12.1mm wide and the object expands to 19.2mm wide at the opposite end. Both the broad and narrow ends are curved and though abraded, seem complete. As it expands the plan of the object swells and then wastes slightly before flaring into the broader end. The object has a flange to either edge. When viewed in profile the object is clearly curved. The surface of the object is abraded. The original surface is mid green and exposed areas are light green. The object does not have an immediately recognisable form and could be Bronze Age to post medieval in date. It is 44.96mm long, 3.84mm thick, the flanges are 5.52mm high and the object weighs 19.09g.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.84","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sible Hedingham","county":"Essex","district":"Braintree","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/DSCN2980.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"44.96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
