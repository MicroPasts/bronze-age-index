Most of the spearhead and some of the blades are present, the rest is missing, presumed lost in antiquity.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is broadly lentoid (diamond) in shape. The socket is incomplete.. The remains of the socket is circular, and extends through both fragments. The blades were probably originally triangular in shape, they taper inwards to the socket.\n\n\n\nThe larger fragment measures 71.4 mm in length, a maximum width of 33.5 mm, across the blades in the centre. It is 14.3 mm thick. The metal is 1.6 mm thick. The socket is 16.1 mm wide at the base, and 8.9 mm wide at the tip. The blades have a surviving width of 9.7 mm and are 2.9 mm thick. It weighs 34.6 g.\n\n\n\nThe smaller fragment measures 24.6 mm in length, 21.8 mm wide and 10.7 mm thick. The metal is 2.0 mm thick. The socket is 7.5 mm wide at the base, and 4.6 mm wide at the top. It weighs 7.6 g.\n\n\n\nTogether both fragments weigh 42.4 g.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a mid green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nFrom the shape of the blades, it is possible that this spearhead fragment was a side looped and socketed type, such as HESH-CFC925 and HESH-C348E5. Peter Reavill comments on those records that: Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC. It is reasonable to assume that this spearhead is of a similar date.","fourFigureLat":"52.89390686","fourFigureLon":"-2.35818076","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eccleshall","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/charm15/WMIDE2A194_D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
