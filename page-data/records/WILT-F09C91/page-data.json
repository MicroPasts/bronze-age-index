This type of axehead are most frequently found to date to the Eqart Park phase (1000-800BC). No trace of the socket remains, but the body is thick (10mm). The object is covered in a pale green patina and there is some pitting. There are no blade tip hollows and the blade does not expand greatly; the blade width is 29mm whilst the cutting edge width is 36mm. The cutting edge is rounded and intact. It is blunt, and there are no remaining traces of sharpening. \n\nThe fragment of axehead weighs 29.19g and is 23mm in length.\n\nThe object resembles object 8 from the late Bronze Age Wickham Park hoard from Croydon in Surrey  and object 39 from the Meldreth hoard from Meldreth in Cambridgeshire (Inventaria Archaeologica). However, the fragmentary nature of the object precludes any definate correlations.","fourFigureLat":"51.419664","fourFigureLon":"-1.713771","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rachel Wood","datefound1":"September 30, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rachel Wood","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mildenhall","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwood/Gillet1006axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
