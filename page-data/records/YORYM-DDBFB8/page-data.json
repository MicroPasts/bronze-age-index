Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in plan and lozenge in section with mid-ribs. The remaining socket is filled with organic material as a result of its deposition.\n\n\n\nAn insufficient portion of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark grey/green patina and is worn. The spear is 27.5mm long, 16.7mm wide, 9.9mm thick and weighs 6.4g.","fourFigureLat":"54.29083288","fourFigureLon":"-0.81856566","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cropton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/RJ0083.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"27.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
