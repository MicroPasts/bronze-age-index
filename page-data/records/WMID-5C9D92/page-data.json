Only the lower blade is represented. It is 34.9mm in length, 49.2mm wide and 14.8mm thick at the blade and weighs 64.94g. There are casting flashes on both sides extanding to the blade edge. The cutting edge is slightly expanded. The axe is slightly worn but in a fair condition although parts of the cutting edge are corrosion chipped. The surface is slightly pitted and has a dark brown patina.\n\nIn the 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections' of the National Museum & Art Gallery, 1980, H. N. Savory states that the socketed axe-head represents a change both in the method of hafting and the method of the production of Bronze Age axes.  The earliest examples of these artefacts in England and Wales appear in the Middle Bronze Age, although most appear in the Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"52.8495","fourFigureLon":"-2.016292","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"February 20, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gayton","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-5C9D92.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"34.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
