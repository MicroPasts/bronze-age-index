The base of the tang widens producing sloped shoulders that have a width of 22mm which then narrow to form the blade. The blade has bevelled edges, creating a lentoid cross-section, that taper to the tip which is now rounded bat would probably have has a finer point in antiquity.  \n\n\n\nThat artefact is now bent in the middle at about an 80 degree angle. It is unlikely that this could have happened post-deposition or as a result of agricultural machine activity, but rather could be a deliberate act of deforming this object at deposition. \n\n\n\n\n\nDr Dot Boughton has commented that Burgess and Gerloff include a blade of similar shape and size in their Group II (Damaged Blades Modified for Rehafting), p. 36ff. Its their no. 248 from Marston Trussel, Northamptonshire which is c. 12.6cm long and 2.1cm wide. It is described as \"Tanged blade, either a knife made in this form or possibly a dirk with butt cut down for rehafting, in which case the torn rivet hole would have been secondary; rather won brown green surfaces with some patches of bright green corrosion; edges worn and chipped.\" Plate 32, no 248.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar examples on the PAS database include LVPL-0B2D08; DUR-F9F5D4; DOR-FAC625 and BERK-302CB3","fourFigureLat":"51.23589838","fourFigureLon":"-0.99872505","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"August 31, 2020","datefound2":"September 04, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upton Grey","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLOE429BE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
