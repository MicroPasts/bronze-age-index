The break is old and the blade is bent a little (horizontally) just before the break. Measures 95.84mm in length and weighs 31.53g.\n\n\nThe butt end has recent damage to the top edge, with loss of patina, and two notches just above the shoulders (the widest point, which measures 29.27x3.38mm).\n\n\nThe narrowing blade extends from the shoulders with a broad flat mid-rib. It is thickest (4.63mm) just below the shoulders. The blade measures 8.44x3.22mm at the break, which is rather more pointed-oval in cross-section.\n\n\nDot Boughton comments:  I would tentatively suggest this belongs to Gerloff and Burgess Group IV dating from the late Middle Bronze Age to the early Late Bronze Age, that is somewhere between the Taunton and Penard metalwork assemblages. The rapiers from the Appleby hoard (in Cumbria) look similar and there is an entire Type Appleby in Group IV dating between c. 1200-1100 BC (early Penard metalwork assemblage).","fourFigureLat":"51.500513","fourFigureLon":"-1.684453","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"July 28, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.63","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Liddington","county":"Swindon","district":"Swindon","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/WILT-AD8D05.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"95.84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
