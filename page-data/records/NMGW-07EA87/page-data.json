The mouth is sub-rectangular (52.3mm long and 43.7 wide) and the four casting runner stubs are evident and raised, positioned on the inner lip of the mouth. There is some damage around one of the runner stubs, with a crack which extends down the face (for 17mm). The socket is rectangular (34.3mm x 30.5.0mm and 71.3mm deep).&nbsp; The mouth moulding has a rounded step (6mm &ndash; 7mm long) well-defined on one face, with a prominent step to the face. The oval sectioned loop springs from the moulding (5mm wide, 6mm thick and 35mm long), enclosing a D-shaped loop (15.9mm x 6.5mm). The sides are gently concave with a minimum width below the loop (40.0mm) before widening to a moderately expanded blade edge (52.3mm wide). The blade edge survives and is gently curved at the centre before curving out to the blade tips. There are a series of nicks at the blade edge, mostly in the central area and appear to be beneath the patina. One side has some damage, which has cut through the patina. The casting seams are prominent and raised (up to 2mm high) but have been neatly finished. The sides are slightly bevelled towards the central seam but are comparatively straight for the type, producing a near-rectangular body section. Both faces are decorated with three near-parallel ribs, which extend a little over half the length of the face (for 55mm). The ribs on one face are interrupted and poorly cast. The edges of the faces appear slightly developed to resemble weak ribs. The faces are gently convex across both their lengths and widths, with one face being more convex in both plains than the other and there are no blade facets. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running off the blade. The blades on both faces have a marked colour difference to the remainder of the faces (12mm from the edge). The axe has a black patination, probably of tenorite, as observed on other contemporary axes. The pale-green patination on the blade end, suggests that the tenorite was removed during the axe finishing. The probable tenorite is also evident over the top of the runner stubs. Numerous small hammer facets are also evident on the blades, below the ends of the ribs. \n\nThe socketed axe is typical of the South Wales (Stogursey) Type, although the near-rectangular body section is a little unusual. The clear patination difference on the end of the blade is of interest to the research informing the deliberate colouring of Late Bronze Age metalwork.","fourFigureLat":"51.5109127","fourFigureLon":"-3.3703334","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pont-y-Clun","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/201919copy1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"97"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
