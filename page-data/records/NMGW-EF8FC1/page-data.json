The artefact has a flat shaped butt end, which tapers in section.  Unusually, the butt end of the axe is pierced by a circular hole (6mm in diameter).  This was made with care in antiquity, possibly by drilling into the metal with a circular implement from each side of the artefact, the hole breaking through the middle (as suggested by its slightly hourglass shaped profile).  The hole is slightly offset from the centre of the butt, and begins 9mm from the butt end.  The axe has a pitted surface appearance with a brown and black coloured iron rich encrustation on the surface, probably deriving from the burial environment of the artefact.  Metallic Bronze is revealed in small areas along the flange top on one side of the implement.  Length 96.5mm, blade width 51.0mm, butt width 17.0mm, maximum thickness 13.0mm, flange depths c.2.0mm, weight 111.5g.\n\nThis is an undecorated Type Derryniggin flanged axe belonging to the Inch Island-Derryniggin metalwork tradition of the Early Bronze Age (Harbison 1969).  It can be assigned to Period 4 and Metalwork Assemblage 6 of the British Bronze Age, dating from 1700-1500cal BC (Needham 1996).","fourFigureLat":"51.59214348","fourFigureLon":"-3.97911853","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Parallels for this flanged axe have been found at Bryn Coch, Blaenrhonddan, Neath (Savory 1980, Cat.No.121) and Margam, Neath-Port Talbot (Savory 1980, Cat.No.122).  The characteristic metalwork products of this period were flanged axes, tanged and end looped spearheads and Camerton-Snowshill daggers (see Burgess 1980).  These are rare in Wales however, by comparison with Inch Island products in Ireland and Arreton products in southern and eastern England (Burgess and Cowen 1972).  It is possible that the axe was made within Wales, as the product of a small scale metalworking centre, and this is a question which might be approached through metallurgical analysis of the impurities within this bronze artefact.  During the past fifteen years copper mines have been found in Wales, and dated to the Early and Middle Bronze Age, using radiocarbon dating method, and therefore a Welsh source is a possibility.\n\nThe reason for piercing the object at the butt end is not immediately clear, and is a rare occurance on comparable flanged axes of this date.  The hole may have been associated with the securing of the haft to the blade, have been used for suspension in some way, or pierced as a deliberate act prior to its deposition.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"June 25, 1999","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mumbles","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"96.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
