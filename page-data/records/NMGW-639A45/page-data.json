The socket (57.8mm deep) has straight sides, each with an internal central rib (beginning 12mm below the mouth) which continue to the base of the socket. The top of the mouth is heavily-corroded, which has removed any evidence for casting runners. The mouth has a prominent rounded moulding and there is a collar moulding beneath the mouth (11mm below). The loop is present (23mm long, 8.5mm wide and 8.4mm high), springing from the collar moulding. The sides are moderately flat across their widths and concave across their lengths, and expand to the blade edge. The blade tips and original blade edge have been lost but the blade appears to have been moderately expanded and with a slight curve (with a surviving blade width of 42.0mm). The casting seams are prominent on both sides and have been hammer-finished. The looped side has a prominent split (43mm long and up to 3mm wide), which may be the result of casting problems. The faces are convex across both their lengths and widths and are decorated with three parallel ribs, descending from the collar moulding. The side ribs are positioned close to the corners of the faces. There are no blade facets evident and no sharpening striations discernible at the blade. The surface has a dark-brown patina, with areas of pale-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nType Yorkshire axes are found throughout Britain but Schmidt & Burgess (1981, pp 238-9, pl. 130) have demonstrated that the distribution is concentrated on the East side of Northern Britain with the greatest density between the rivers Humber and the Tees. This example may be seen as being a somewhat south westerly outlier to the main areas of recovery.\n\n\n\nNeedham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
