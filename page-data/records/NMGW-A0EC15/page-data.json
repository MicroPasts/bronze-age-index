The ring is D-shaped with an integral rectangular delicate loop on the straight side. The faces are flat and the external sides are rounded. The interior is faceted, with possible wear facets along the straight side.","fourFigureLat":"51.527681","fourFigureLon":"-2.232031","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-500","notes":"This is likely to represent the inner piece from a composite harness or strap fitting and can be paralleled with examples represented in Late Bronze Age hoards from Parc-Y-Meirch, Denbighshire (Savory, 1980), Welby, Leicestershire (Smith ed., 1957) and a hollow example from Grange-over-Sands, Lancashire (Davey & Forster, 1975). Within the Parc-Y-Meirch hoard there are four similar larger examples. One of the examples (Savory 1980, No. 269:4, 4a) is hollow and fits within a larger ring. Parc-Y-Meich also has an example where the rectangular loop of another ring fits within a slot in a toggle (Savory 1980, No. 271:1-2). The example in the Welby hoard is very similar except that it is approximately twice as large as this example. The Grange-over-Sands piece is a similar size but is hollow.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"7.8","edge":null,"thickness":"3.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grittleton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2053.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"18.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
