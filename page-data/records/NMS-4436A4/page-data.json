The axe has a narrow butt with moderately concave sides. Initially the sides are only slightly flaring but in the last 20% of its length the width increases by another 50% to form the curved cutting edge. In profile, the axe is lenticular with the maximum thickness at the centre of its length.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 34.4mm in length, 12.0mm in max.width, 4.2mm in max.thickness and weighs 4.97g.\n\n\n\nThe axe appears to be modelled on the Class 3 non-flanged axe types of Period 2 circa 2100-1900 BC. It is too small to have functioned as an axe and current archaeological thinking believes they played a role in votive/ritual practices or functioned as amulets. Despite the obvious lack of contemporaneity, those modelled on later Bronze Age axe types, viz socketed and looped, have been found in secure Iron Age and Roman contexts.","fourFigureLat":"52.71798245","fourFigureLon":"0.78202405","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"December 09, 2018","datefound2":"December 09, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Litcham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/NMS4436A4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Garry Crace","length":"34.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
