The edge of the blade is curved without flared tips and has a profile suggesting that this is possibly of the Middle Bronze Age palstave type. The patina is light green to brownish grey. The break reveals a casting void which approaches the surface on one side and may demonstrate a weakness which led to original break.","fourFigureLat":"51.24814476","fourFigureLon":"-0.46831982","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1100","notes":"Found in the same area as SUR-E6EBD6, but no clear association is demonstrable due to a lack of accurate findspot being provided by the finder.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Horsley","county":"Surrey","district":"Guildford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURE72368.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"26.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
