The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. The tops of side loops are present on either side. There is damage to both edges of the blade. The socket survives to a depth of 19.1 mm.&nbsp;\n\nIt measures 89.0 mm&nbsp;in length, 16.1 mm&nbsp;wide (base), 3.4&nbsp;mm&nbsp;wide (tip) and 9.2&nbsp;mm&nbsp;thick. It weighs 23.3 g.\n\nThe spear head is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\nThis object has lost most of it&#39;s diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult. However similar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including SWYOR-1F74C1, SF-C557DC and WMID-270D2F. All have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"52.66930788","fourFigureLon":"-1.69089489","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"The 3D model has been generated using the mobile phone scanning application Qlone.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harlaston","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMIDD7A28E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"89"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
