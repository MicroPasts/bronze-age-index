It is complete and has a chocolate-brown patina. The casting seams have been taken off and the remains smoothed down. The blade was hammered into shape and is now splayed/crescent-shaped. The cutting edge is still sharp and there are not very many re-sharpening marks visible. Also, there is only a small number of nicks and dents which means that it has not been extensively used.\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K. and Burgess, C. 1981.
