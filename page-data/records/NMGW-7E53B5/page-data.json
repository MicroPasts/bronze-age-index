The axe is represented by the end of the blade only and no evidence survives on the broken section for the bottom of a socket. The blade edge and the blade tips have also been lost. The sides of the axe are diverging, possibly resulting in a recurved blade edge. The faces are slightly convex, resulting in an oval section. The axe would have been comparatively slender, probably suggesting the fragment was from a palstave or socketed axe.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katrina Deering","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nevern","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kdeering/DSCN2367.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"19.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
