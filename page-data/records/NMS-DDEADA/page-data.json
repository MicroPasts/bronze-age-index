The cutting edge is V-shaped in profile and moderately convex when viewed from either face. It becomes increasingly more convex towards one end, as it curves around to form the very beginning of one of the side edges, before meeting the break.\n\nThe break is ancient and runs broadly parallel to the cutting edge, and then finally obliquely.  No vestige of the side edge survives at the other end but symmetry suggests that it was no more than a few millimetres away. The metal is patinated dark brown on the two faces and reddish-orange on the break. c. 1500 to 800 B.C.\n\n\n\nLength (cutting edge to break): 8.1mm. Width: 35.3mm. Thickness: 3.9mm.
