The edges of the blade are straight and gradually taper to a rounded point. The butt is trapezoid with a flat rear and concave shoulders. Rivet holes to either side,of the butt, one of which is partially broken, would have secured the hilt. Both rivets are missing and one of the holes is filled with iron concretion. The blade is lozengiform in cross section and has a very low rounded spine. The rounded tip and uneven edge suggest re-sharpening and a prolonged lifetime of use. The surface of the object shows some damage and is covered by extensive iron concretion from ground water.","fourFigureLat":"51.91131007","fourFigureLon":"-1.12915597","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"Dirks and rapiers of this type belong to Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group IV.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"November 17, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stratton Audley","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURCDFEEC.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"142.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
