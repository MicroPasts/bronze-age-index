The fragment consists of part of the rim of the socket extending down into the body, with the loop present. Little of the curvature of the mouth is discernible but it would appear to be angular rather than smooth. There is a raised band on the outer side by the mouth. A possible further, lower band is visible beyond. At right angles to the bands is a possible casting seam, extending into the loop. The semicircular loop is around 23.8mm long, 9.5mm high, and is 8.7mm wide and 3.8mm thick at its centre. The breaks on all sides are worn and the metal is light/mid green with light-brown patches in places. Insufficient remains to identify to which phase or style it belongs.","fourFigureLat":"51.076325","fourFigureLon":"-1.316212","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"November 08, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"16.3","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Headbourne Worthy","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-2F8427socketedaxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"32.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
