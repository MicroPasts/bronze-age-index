Neither the two torcs nor the two bracelets form matching pairs although the pairs are similar in size and form. The hoard includes two torcs of a similar form but with the main difference between them being the number of the ridges formed by twisting (Torc 1 has 43 ridges while Torc 2 has 77 ridges). The two bracelets are significantly different in colour which presumably suggests different alloys. Bracelet 1 is more extensively decorated that Bracelet 2.\n\nThe hoard was removed from the ground by the finder who reports that at a depth of two feet one torc was found with one bracelet centred within it. About two inches below this lay the other torc and bracelet similarly positioned.\n\n\n\n\nTorcs\n\nTorc 1. A twisted torc with hooked terminals and with 43 ridges formed by twisting. This torc measures 180mm across and is 10.2mm thick at its widest point. It weighs 143g. Of the two hooked terminals one is now missing (a length of about 25mm), though the break appears fresh, and the other is now detached by a break 67mm along the circumference of the torc.\n\nTorc 2. A twisted torc with holed terminals and with 77 ridges formed by twisting. This torc measures 187mm across and is 11mm thick at its widest point. It weighs 165g. The torc is intact and complete apart from the extreme tip of one of the hooked terminals.\n\n\n\n\nBracelets\n\nBracelet 1. An annular bracelet weighing 224g and measuring c.87mm in diameter. The bracelet is c.12mm thick and has a narrow irregular sinuous casting groove around its outer face. This bracelet is heavily decorated with narrow incised lines. On both sides there is a band of herring bone decoration which runs centrally around the circumference. This band is interrupted by three pairs of groups of closely-spaced transverse lines which are confined to 180 degrees of the circle. Between each outer pair is a transverse band of herring bone lines, while between the central pair is a band of lines running at 90 degrees to the transverse lines. The remaining external circumference is filled with groups of closely-spaced diagonal lines which alternate in direction.\n\nThe interior face of this bracelet is plain.\n\n\n\nBracelet 2. An annular bracelet weighing 216g and measuring c.84mm in diameter. The bracelet is c.10.2mm thick and has a deep and irregular sinuous casting groove around its inner face and a much narrower irregular groove on its outer face. There is an area of surface loss on one side. The section is less circular than Bracelet 1 and has a flatter inner face. Decoration is confined to a central band of herring bone lines on both sides. This is interrupted at one point only by a transverse band of 17 incised lines.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This prehistoric base metal hoard comprises more than one object and therefore should be considered Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 (as amended in 2002).","fourFigureLat":"50.98339915","fourFigureLon":"-0.91868822","fromdate":"1300","todate":"1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"May 13, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"4","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Buriton","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSC01191.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
