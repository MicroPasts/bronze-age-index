The palstave body is near sub-rectangular at the break (with a width of 25.2mm and a thickness of 16.1mm); the blade faces are convex across their widths and the sides are slightly divergent to the mid points. The casting seam is discernable on the sides. The sides expand slightly towards the blade although any blade tips have been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 34.4mm). The blade faces are flat or very slightly convex across their lengths and no decoration is evident of the fragment. The original surface of the palstave, comprising a dark green to brown patina, has largely been lost and the current surface is pale green with areas of active corrosion. The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The slender blade may suggest a palstave of Transitional or Late types. The high lead content of the bronze may reinforce a later date within the palstave range. Transitional and Late palstaves span Penard, Wilburton and Ewart Park metalworking phases, corresponding to the later part of Needham's (1996) Period 5 through to Period 7. It is therefore possible to suggest a date of c. 1300 - 750BC.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanrhidian Lower","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.56.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"50.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
