Sub-oval-section, slightly flattened on the upper and lower face, with a copper alloy core and outer banded gold sheath. The banding appears lighter with an almost silvery colour on the outer face and a darker, slightly blackened appearance on the inner face. Broken at both ends with possible traces of having been cut or chopped. The exposed copper alloy surface is fairly corroded, suggesting ancient breaks.
