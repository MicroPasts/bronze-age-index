The object is a single cast chisel with a flat bladed terminal that widens towards the middle of the piece before tapering down to a point which is now worn. There is no decoration on the object and it has an dark red brown patina. Small chisels and tools of this type were used for an extensive period of time, not simply in the Bronze age, but also in later periods for jewellery making and fine work. As such dating the object is difficult. The awl measures 50.3mm in length, 6.6mm in thickness, and weighs 7.14g.","fourFigureLat":"52.07914794","fourFigureLon":"-0.79026831","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"March 27, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Haversham-cum-Little Linford","county":"Milton Keynes","district":"Milton Keynes","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC23F078.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"50.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
