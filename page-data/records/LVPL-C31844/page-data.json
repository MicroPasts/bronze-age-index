However, due to the lack of context and continuation of casting styles, this fragment could be dated from the Bronze Age through to the Roman Period (c.2150 BC - 410 AD).\n\n\n\nThe fragment is sub triangular in plan, and roughly D shaped in cross section. It has an irregular, rough surface. It is most likely part of a copper ingot, prior to being smelted and cast. It is a mid to dark green colour. A couple of small areas of iron staining, probably due to impurities in the copper. An even patina covers the surface.\n\n\nIt measures 43.87mm in length, 24.86mm wide and 12.81mm thick. It weighs 36.8 grams.\n\n\n\n\nIn appearance, the fragment does display some similarities to a barbed and tanged arrowhead shape. However arrowheads made from copper alloy are incredibly rare and tend to be almost flat in profile, it is highly improbable that this fragment is a Bronze Age arrowhead. Due to the weight and appearance of the fragment, it is more likely that it is a small piece of a copper ingot, produced from the smelting of the copper ore, in preparation for casting. Casting waste is very hard to date in isolation but the patina and  form might suggest a Bronze Age - Roman date. A direct comparison has not been  found. The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually  recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.","fourFigureLat":"53.555945","fourFigureLon":"-2.937373","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.81","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"ORMSKIRK","county":"Lancashire","district":"West Lancashire","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/LVPL-C31844.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"43.87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
