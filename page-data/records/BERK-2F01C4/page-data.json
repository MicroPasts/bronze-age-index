The flanges begin about a third of the way along the butt&#39;s length. The cleft between the flanges is relatively smother perhaps from use and there is an irregular hole through the middle near the stop. The casting seem is visible along the sides of the axehead, though some effort to reduce it appears to have taken place. The stop is shallow and worn. The stop has rounded corners with the flanges. The loop is on one side which arcs over the position on the stop. The blade is long, thin and narrow and extends extensively before flaring out at the blade end. there is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade. The cutting edge is very worn on the upper edge and is worn down relatively straight.\n\nTotal Measurements: 149.6mm long, 30.9mm thick at the loop, 61.8mm wide at blade edge and 392.72g in weight\n\nThe form of this palstave is broadly similar to Rowlands&#39; type 1 Mid rib palstaves and Schmidt and Burgess&#39; low flanged group. However its flanges rise above the septum which is defining of South Western type&nbsp;palstaves (Rowlands class 5 group 2) first defined by Smith (1959) which are suggested to date from c.1400-1150 cal BC. This is a particularly western location for this form of axehead.","fourFigureLat":"51.20392391","fourFigureLon":"-2.25902646","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"July 10, 2021","datefound2":"July 10, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Smither","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Corsley","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK2F01C4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"149.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
