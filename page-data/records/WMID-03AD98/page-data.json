The axehead is sub-triangular in plan with a wide curved blade which tapers to the butt, which has rounded shoulders. The axehead is 63.7 mm wide at the blade end, tapering to approximately 24 mm at the butt. It is lozengiform in section, slightly thinner at the edges than in the centre, and the eges are rounded. There is no evidence for any decoration, and there is no stop ridge or flanges for the haft, indicating that this is an early flat axe. It measures 96.3 mm long, 0.98 mm thick and weighs 272.7 grams. The axehead has a very dark green, almost black patina in places, however on most parts of the axe this surface has rubbed away, exposing a paler green patina. Flat axes are amongst the earliest metal objects discovered in Britain.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"March 01, 2010","datefound2":"March 30, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.98","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lowick","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"East Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-03AD98.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"96.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
