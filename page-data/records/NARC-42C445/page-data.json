The spear tip is made from cast copper-alloy. It measures 55 mm long and tapers from 22.5 mm to 3.5 mm at the point. The spear is socketed with a circular hole running through it. The spear has a rounded ridge running down the length of the spear, on both the top and bottom, making it circular in profile, with a triangular wing (formed by the edge of the spear) to either side. The spear dates to the late Bronze Age, from around 1200 to 800 BC. Similar artefacts are illustrated in Langmaid (1976, page 53; figure 19).","fourFigureLat":"52.144592","fourFigureLon":"-1.066159","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Blakesley","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-42C445spearrev.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"55"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
