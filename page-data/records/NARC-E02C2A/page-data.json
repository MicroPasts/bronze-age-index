In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. All of the edges are broken and abraded. The fragment terminates in an old abraded transverse break at both ends. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing.\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark green in colour with a slightly pitted patina.\n\n\n\nAs this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).\n\n\n\nSimilar objects can be found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database: NLM-99D791, IOW-F3883D, SUR-BB2595\n\n\n\nLength: 72.44mm, Width: 10.84mm, Thickness (at base): 8.05mm, Thickness (tip): 4.76mm, Weight: 13.3g","fourFigureLat":"52.37591309","fourFigureLon":"-0.79686671","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cransley","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Kettering","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARCE02C2Aa.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"72.44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
