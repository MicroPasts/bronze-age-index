The object flares very slightly from the butt to the cutting edge, but this is extremely subtle and not characteristic of broad flared axeheads. There are slightly raised flanges present, but these are only present on one surface, and can only be felt rather than seen. There is a suggestion of a slight nick at the butt but it is otherwise complete. The surface is pitted and a mixture of typical green patinisation, soil staining in the pits, and flecks of the original high shine surface. \n\n\n\nThe object's slender size implies it could potentially be a deliberately manufactured miniature object, with parallels including SWYOR-6E7AE7, which references the similar HAMP-710DC5, and presents a nuanced discussion of the designation of these objects as chisels, axeheads, or miniature objects. NLM-E45686, recorded as a chisel, is a potentially close parallel, although that record (in spite of the diminutive size of the object) denies that these artefacts are likely of Bronze Age date and suggests a broader range. This may be due to the lack of a tang, typical of Bronze Age chisel forms. Delicate, rather than miniature, flanged axeheads are discussed at length in the record for HESH-FBF348, but this example is distinctly truncated in comparison. For this example, a designation as Flat Axehead is considered to be most appropriate. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: 64.9mm length, 25.1mm width (at cutting edge), 18.2mm width (at butt), 10.7mm thickness, weight 78.52g.","fourFigureLat":"50.64690195","fourFigureLon":"-3.4299035","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"April 30, 2021","datefound2":"August 06, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lympstone","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEVD0FFF1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"64.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
