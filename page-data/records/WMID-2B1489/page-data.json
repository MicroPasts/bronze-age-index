It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces, triangular in cross-section, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. There is some damage to the edges of the blade and no edge bevels are discernable. The socket is oval in cross-section and is hollow. The socket is 50.8 mm deep. It has cast side loops roughly half way along the socket. The loops are a flat oval in cross-section, and one is blocked with a casting flange that has not been trimmed. The casting seams along the sides of the socket have been trimmed.\n\n\n\nIt measures 120.2 mm in length. a maximum blade width of 23.5 mm, a minimum blade width of 8.0 mm. The edges of the blades are 1.7 mm thick. At the base of the wings, the socket has an external diameter of 12.8 mm and at the base of the socket, it measures 18.2 mm. The socket is 2.3 mm thick. The side loops measure 14.4 mm long and 5.4 mm wide. They are 3.3 mm above the surface of the socket. It weighs 63.13 g.\n\n\n\nThe spear has a smooth dark brown patina.\n\n\n\nSeveral similar spears have been recorded on the PAS database, including WMID-56E2E4 and SWYOR-A8FC69.
