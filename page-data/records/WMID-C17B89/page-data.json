At it's widest point it is 28.24mm and 55.68mm long.\n\n\n\nThe item has a socketed shaft, with two aligned perforations near the top of the shaft on either side. The socketed shaft tapers to a band and then flares into a sub triangular head that gradually thins to a cutting edge. The object is in good condition and is largely brown with a Verdigris patina. A small piece of wood was found inside the socket; it is very small and fits into the base of the shaft. It is roughly triangular in shape with a rounded tip and mainly green in colour. A tiny copper alloy pin was also discovered in the perforation hole. \n\n\n\nA similar example has been recorded on this database under record SF-F59C95. Also, similar to one shown in Nicholson's Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in Merseyside County Museum (1980: 47) no. 78.","fourFigureLat":"52.74738396","fourFigureLon":"-2.87547802","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Harrold","datefound1":"January 27, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Harrold","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.52","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Montford","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/harrbec68/WMIDC17B89.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"55.68"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
