It is made from a single length of 2.7mm diameter, copper alloy wire, one end of which is a tightly wound to form a six turn spiral. From this the wire is bent back on itself to form a hook-like catch plate. The wire is twisted back and forth to form five, figure of 8 loops on the end of which is an integral pin. The wire is cracked at this point. The brooch is in excellent condition with a mid-brown patination which contains some grains of sand. Length 99.3mm, Width 41.7mm, Height 26.2mm, Mass 30.31g.\n\n\n\nThis brooch is of Central European type and can be closely paralleled by two examples found in a hoard of gold jewellery on the bank of the Danube between Duna-Földvár and Paks in Hungary. This was dated to the 11th to 9th century BC (Hugh Tait, 7000 years of Jewellery, The British Museum, 2006, 51, plate 108). A further parallel is provided by an example in Merseyside Museums which is provenance as 'Northern Hungary' (Susan Nicholson, Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in the Merseyside County Museums, Merseyside County Council, Liverpool,, 1980, 70, No. 141.\n\n\n\nWhile it is not impossible for this object to have found its way to England in antiquity its condition, and the fact that it was a surface find, suggest that it may be a recent import, perhaps coming from a European collection during the Second World War and, its significance unrecognised, subsequently lost.","fourFigureLat":"52.09430049","fourFigureLon":"-1.89923645","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kevin Leahy","datefound1":"January 01, 1962","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kevin Leahy","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"26.2","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Badsey","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kaleahy/Birm623.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"99.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
