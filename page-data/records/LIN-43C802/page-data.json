The object has a pointed oval socket with a slightly expanded lip.  The socket has concave sides which flare outwards gradually towards the convex cutting edge.  The concave sides have a slight lip to them which disappears once they meet the straight edge.  The hollow socket tapers as it goes towards the cutting edge, being solid approximately 17mm before the edge.  The cutting edge is very worn and blunt.  No decoration is visible.  The surface displays localised evidence of active bronze disease, mixed between light brownish deposits of an uncertain material.\n\nInside the socket there are three patches of bright green copper corrosion.  Both patches bear a wood grain impression suggesting that the object was once hafted on a wooden shaft.\n\nThis object was discovered lying ontop of another object, recorded on the Portable Antiquities database as LIN-436A46.  This other object is also of uncertain date and function, however it does not display the same surface patina as the ?spear.\n\nThe external dimensions of the socket measure 46mm by 23mm, whilst the internal measure 30mm by 18mm.  The length of socket to the start of the blade is 18mm.  \n\nThe object is similar in some ways to Later Bronze Age tools, such as spears and chisels, although most of these have circular sockets.  oval sockets are seen on some Irish Bronze Age metalwork, however the form, relative thinness and 'tinny' feel to these two items suggests a much later date.\n\nThese two items were shown to the British Museum for identification and as potential Treasure, however their verdict was that they were not prehistoric in date.","fourFigureLat":"52.632606","fourFigureLon":"-0.449981","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"1699","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barnack","county":"City of Peterborough","district":"City of Peterborough","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN-43C802.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
