The spearhead has a leaf shaped, lozenge-sectioned blade with a raised rounded mid-rib ridge extending to the tip of the blade. There are two sub-circular/rectangular loops incorporated into the base of the blade, one either side of the central rib. The mid-rib extends and expands to form the hollow circular-sectioned socket. Both edges of the blade are abraded. The base of the socket is compressed and damaged, and there is deposition residue inside the hollow cavity. The spearhead measures 153.2mm in length, 31mm in maximum width and a maximum of 20mm diameter at the socketed end. The blade is 2mm thick. The spearhead weighs 104.69 grams.\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a Group 8 Middle Bronze Age spearhead as defined by Davis (2017), with characteristic incorporated basal loops, and are associated with the Taunton and Penard phases (1400-1125 BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.7638934","fourFigureLon":"-0.07414839","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brickendon Liberty","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"East Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH7C283C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"153.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
