The axe is complete, except for the arch of the side loop. The body of the palstave is narrow but splays down the blade eventually flaring at the blade edge which is wide. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which may well have been hammered. The butt is squared, tapering with narrow flanges on both sides. The side loop is adjacent to the stop ridge and incomplete. Both sides of the blades are heavily pitted and scratched. There is green patina and iron-corrosion across the whole of the axe.\n\n\n\nThe palstave axe measures 132mm in length. The blade is 48.5mm wide and 2.5mm thick at the cutting edge and the butt 21.0mm wide and 14.0mm thick at the stop.The axe weighs 234 grams.\n\n\n\nSimilar to LANCUM-050851, the two Type Silsden side-looped palstaves can be dated to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 161). They are classified within the broader 'Late Palstave' type but are typologically close to 'Transitional Palstaves' such as Type Shelf (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160). \n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.
