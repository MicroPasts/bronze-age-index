A stumpy and possibly miscast axehead with a wide sub-rectangular mouth (circa 29mm x 27mm) with a slightly flared edge of thickness circa 5mm, a loop of length 22mm adjacent to the socket, and with traces of three ribs of length circa 29mm on either side of the blade. Only the central ribs are clearly discernible, the others falling close to the aris between the sides and the upper and lower surfaces. Incompletely cleaned casting flash extends along the underside of the axe, and this is adjacent to a split of length 36mm extending from the mouth of the socket towards the blade, adjacent to the loop. The axe is abraded, most heavily at its cutting edge and socket. Given the possibility that the casting was deficient, this wear should probably not be attributed to use of the axe, and indeed, the primary function of such objects may not have been as tools. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1150-800 BC.\n\n\n\nLength: 75.7mm, Width: 43.1mm, Thickness (overall): 36.0mm, Weight: 165.44gms.","fourFigureLat":"53.55399","fourFigureLon":"-0.839187","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Martin Foreman","datefound1":"October 18, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Martin Foreman","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"36","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Belton","county":"North Lincolnshire","district":"North Lincolnshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mforeman/NLM21208a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"North Lincolnshire Museum","length":"75.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
