The axe is complete, but one corner has been recently broken, but is not missing. In plan the axe is a sub elongated triangle. The butt is rounded, and in profile slightly tapers to a rounded edge. The sides are straight with no flaring outwards of the blade tip. The blade cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical suggesting the axe was functional rather than votive. In profile, lengthways, the axehead curves slightly. The surface of the axehead has an abraded surface with patches of blue corrosion and a large area of encrustation. The patina is a mottled mid grey/green colour. The axe measures 117.99mm long from the butt to the apex of the cutting edge. It is 55.95mm wide from blade tip to blade it, and is 8.08mm thick at its thickest point on the body. It weighs 182g.\n\n\n\nThe nature of the corrosion, with blue patches and analysis of past flat axes suggest the material is more likely to be copper rather than copper alloy or has a particularly high copper content. The axe is a flat axe, which dates to the early Bronze Age, c. 2000 to 1600 BC. Watson (1993 Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums BAR British Series 233) illustrates similar flat axes, Nos. 115 and 116, but these have slightly more flared blade tips.","fourFigureLat":"51.435599","fourFigureLon":"-2.749461","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2013","datefound2":"March 05, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.08","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Somerset","district":"","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-5E5FB8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"117.99"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
