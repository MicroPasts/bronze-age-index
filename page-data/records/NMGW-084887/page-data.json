The thin butt has a gentle curve (with a width of 19.5mm and a thickness of 2.0mm). One side is near-straight, slightly convex and diverging gently towards the bade (with a width at the top of the blade of 29.5mm), before diverging sharply to the recurved blade edge (with a blade width of 44.0mm). The other side has a noticeable bulge below the butt, giving the axe an asymmetric appearance. The blade edge was crescentic, now asymmetric, perhaps slightly eroded or worn on one side. The sides are convex across their thicknesses’ but without faceting and without a practical flange, although there appears to be a lip or low flange from the side-working. Although the faces give the axe a lenticular long profile, two curving bevels present: the median bevel is subtle and is positioned comparatively low on the axe (54mm from the butt and where the axe has a maximum thickness of 11.9mm). A more pronounced blade facet is evident (23mm from the blade edge). There are irregular incised marks on the blade, below the patina but unlikely to sharpening striations. The surface has a dark-green patina with some bright green damage on one face. \n\n\n\nThe presence of a subtle median bevel, blade facet and ‘lip’ flanges all suggest early developed features, probably indicating an axe early in the sequence of class 4 or the last of Class 3 axes of the Mile Cross Assemblage. The dimensions and ratios do not correlate directly with Needham’s subtypes, although are perhaps closest to 3G, Type Knapton but do not closely confirm to the type. The form broadly corresponds with Type Aylesford, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess’s (1981, p. 60)[1] as a ‘primitive’ developed flat axe. The form would suggest a date at the earlier part of Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, probably dating to c. 2050 – 1850BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
