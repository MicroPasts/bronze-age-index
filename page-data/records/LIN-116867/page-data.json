The socket is circular in cross-section and has a complete opening. The socket measures 18mm in external diameter and 16mm internally. There are two side loops on the socket, both of which are pointed oval in plan and rise only a short way from the socket. The side loops measure 14mm in length, 7mm in width and rise approximately 3mm from the surface. Between the loops just in from the rim of the socket there is a small irregular shaped patch of copper alloy that looks to be untrimmed casting waste. The socket tapers to the break, at which point it measures 7mm in diameter with a small opening in the centre. The blade is incomplete. On one side the blade is only represented by a short irregular stub of copper alloy, whereas on the other side the lower part of the blade is in good condition. The blade measures 12mm in width with 2mm of that being the narrowed blade edge. The surviving blade measures 24mm in length. The top of the blade is missing, but the break is fairly regular and looks more like it has been intentionally cut rather than accidently broken. Given that there is untrimmed casting waste and intentional destruction of the object, it would appear that this spear was a ceremonial or ritual item. The spear was discovered in the Witham Valley, in which there is a marked concentration of individual finds of spears and hoards of spears, but few axes.","fourFigureLat":"53.22606838","fourFigureLon":"-0.45859504","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"August 31, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"18","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cherry Willingham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"70"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
