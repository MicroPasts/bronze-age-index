They appear to form part of a metalworkers' hoard. The swords have been deliberately broken into fragments so that they can be easily melted down. One fragment appears to have already been subjected to intense heat and is partially melted. \n\n    \n    There are two large pieces of sword blade. Both are lentoidal in section and have a pronounced line along each cutting edge. One fragment measures 100.78mm  by 31.85mm and is a maximum of 6.29mm thick. The other is 104.2mm by 40.44mm and is a maximum of 6.73mm thick. There are two further sword blade fragments. One measures 73mm by 36.25mm and is 5.83mm thick; the other measures 27.15mm by 36.18mm and is 4.97mm thick.\n\n    \n    There are also two fragments of sword handles. The larger of the two fragments measures 63.21mm by 37.84mm and is 3.36mm thick. It has marginal ribs running down its edges and two circular perforations. One is filled with iron corrosion. This suggests that at least this fragment can be dated to the cusp between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (c. 600BC). The other sword handle is more corroded. It is similar in shape and measures 32.98mm by 40.57mm and is 4.71mm thick. The circular rivet hole can be seen on the broken edge of the handle.\n    \n\n    A single circular section, copper alloy rivet was found with the fragments of sword. It measures 18.28mm in length and 2.84mm in diameter.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philippa Walton","datefound1":"July 31, 2002","datefound2":"July 31, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"6","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ainderby Steeple","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pwalton/bronzeagesword 006.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
