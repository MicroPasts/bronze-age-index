The asymmetrical butt is very thin and 'edge-like' and is rounded (with a width of 30.6mm). The sides are straight and divergent to just above the midpoint (c. 60mm from the butt), after which the sides are concave and divergent to produce a moderately rounded blade edge (with a width of 80.6mm). The midsection of the blade edge is comparatively straight, possibly through use. The sides are slightly rounded across their thickness. The axe faces are both convex, producing a lentoid body profile, with no evidence of a blade facet. The surface is corroded and heavily-pitted with remnant patches of dark-brown patina. There is no evidence to suggest surface decoration on the remnants of surviving surface.\n\n\n\nAnalysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe and was carried out[3] using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM) fitted with an Oxford Instruments energy dispersive X-ray detector and INCA spectrometer (EDS). Operating conditions employed a 30o take-off angle, a 20kV accelerating voltage, and the samples were analysed for 100 seconds livetime with a beam current which yielded a count rate of c.4000 counts per second when on a metallic cobalt standard. The results show the metal composition is a tin-bronze alloy (with mean readings of copper: 85.86% and tin: 10.98%), with a significant trace of arsenic (with a mean reading of 2.67%) and traces of lead (with a mean reading of 0.44%). It is difficult to match this composition to Northover's (1980, p 229-243 )[4] Early Bronze Age metal groups.\n\n\n\nThe generalised form of this bronze axe is thin butted with gradually diverging sides to a comparatively wide blade edge. The axe has no developed features seen on later axes and therefore is likely to be of Type Migdale dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
