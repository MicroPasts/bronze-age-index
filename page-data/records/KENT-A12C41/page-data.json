The upper centre of the body has a recess.  The object is decorated with grooves, running top to botom of each arm creating a ribbed effect. It has a mottled light grey brown and light green patination. Part of the central body has some advanced green verdigris.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 20.63mm long, 18.23mm wide, 10.58mm thick and 10.2g in weight.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: A number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered, with distinct variants identifiable. Examples with a shape very similar to this example have been recorded on the PAS at NARC-39B60B, NARC-2C32D7 and BERK-C3E5A3, with One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117).\n\n\n\nThey are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although recess in the body of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. This was possibly something such as a dagger handle, although the absence of evidence makes this conjectural. Another suggestion has been a Scabbard Chape, in which case the object would be the other way up. Dr JD Hill formerly of the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.","fourFigureLat":"51.27597124","fourFigureLon":"0.9090905","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.58","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Selling","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTA12C41.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"20.63"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
