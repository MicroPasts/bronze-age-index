The mouth of the socket is sub-rectangular in shape this has a moulded collar running around its circumference on the outside with the side loop beginning just below the moulding. Running down either side is casting flash. The main shaft of the axe is rectangular in cross section, with three pronounced moulded ridges that run down from the socket and converge just above the blade to form a V-shape. The blade is crescent shaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe casting of this axe is extremely poor, this combined with poor quality metal has resulted in heavy pitting over the whole artefact. This pitting would have occurred during the manufacturing process and would most likely be the result of bubbles forming in the mould during casting.  Considering the poor quality of the metal and it's weaken state due to poor casting, it is unlikely this axe was used as a tool, but instead may have been used ritualistically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1200-800BC","fourFigureLat":"51.399254","fourFigureLon":"-2.806365","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"\nLower Claverham Rally find\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Yatton","county":"North Somerset","district":"North Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/3391 Late Bronze Age axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"69.24"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
