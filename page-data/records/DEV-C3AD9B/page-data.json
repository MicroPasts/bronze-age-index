The chisel survives complete, although the tang has been damaged, and is now bent at 45 degrees to the plane.\n\n\n\nThe tang is rectangular in cross section, tapering to a point in profile and with a sub-rectangular end in plan, with the remains of casting seems running down either lateral face, particularly prominent at the interstice with the collar. The latter is elaborated, and oval in cross section, with concave sides and an expanded upper edge. The blade projects from below the less pronounced lower edge of the collar, exapanding into a crescentic cutting edge in plan, whist tapering to a point in profile. The lateral faces are faceted, creating a shallow, sub-hexagonal cross section. The blade is undecorated.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 85.9mm; width of tang at mid point c. 6.0mm; width of collar 11.4mm; width of cutting edge 27.9mm; maximum thickness (at collar) 9.6mm; weight 27.68g.\n\n\n\nA similar tanged chisel was found in association with a large amount of Late Bronze Age material as part of a probable Early Iron Age hoard at Gussage St. Michael, Dorset (Knight, Ormrod & Pearce 2015: 51, no. 250b). Another similar example, from Kingston, Dorset, is published by Pearce (1984: 476, no. 416a), from a site which has also produced Late Bronze Age pottery. Numerous similar chisels are also recorded onto this database, but cf. WILT-CDB685, which is particularly similar.","fourFigureLat":"50.74335493","fourFigureLon":"-2.72417805","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Loders","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEVC3AD9B.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"85.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
