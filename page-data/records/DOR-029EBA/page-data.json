The spearhead is in two conjoining pieces, broken accross the socket below the blades. The end of the socket is damaged and incomplete.The blades are outcurved at the base before tapering in to a narrow tip, forming a flame-shape. There is prominent midrib running between the blades and extending into the socket. The midrib is lozengiform in cross section as is the upper part of the socket. The lower end of the socket is circular in cross section. There is a low flattish side loop on either side with oval apertures. The upper part of the socket retains what appears to be a piece of mineralised wood.\n\nDate: Middle Bronze Age - c. 1200 - 1000 BC\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill suggestes the spearhead is from the Taunton metalwork phase.","fourFigureLat":"50.92525691","fourFigureLon":"-2.21479048","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sarah Kelman","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Iwerne Minster","county":"Dorset","district":"North Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/caht/029EBAa.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"149.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
