Spearhead blade fragment. The upper part of a probable leaf-shaped blade with convex edges. The break is corroded. The midrib is round in section, but none of the socket survives. The hollowed edge bevels are fairly broad. Length: 73 mm; width: 33 mm; thickness: 13.5 mm; weight 41.9 g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Bugle-shaped fitting. Complete, two-part bugle-shaped fitting, the two parts being fused together by corrosion. Component A is a D-shaped loop of thick round section with a thinner rectangular staple appended to the flat side. The staple is slotted into component B, a spool-shaped piece with slots in opposing sides and a perforation at just one end. The last is blocked by soil, or possibly clay-core remnant, which can also be seen adhering to the interior either side of the slot. Extremely desiccated traces of organic material, possibly leather are visible through the slot and probably derive from a strap threaded round the staple. Length: 39 mm; width: 35 mm; breadth (excluding corrosion) 13.5 mm; width of loop 9.2 mm; breadth of loop 9.8 mm; weight: 28.4 g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Ring. Complete oval ring, unequal in thickness from one side to the other. Hoop section is also oval. Diameter: 31.5 x 29.3 mm; thickness of hoop 1.7 - 3.0 mm; breadth of hoop 1.4 - 2.3 mm; weight: 2.2 g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Ring. Complete circular ring, unequal in both thickness and breadth from one side to the other. The hoop is of oval to lenticular section. It is fractured across the hoop at a point where there is a radial rectangular perforation, approximately 4 x 1.5 mm; this lies one-third around the circuit from the thinnest part. Diameter: 24.5 mm; thickness 2.5 - 4.2 mm; breadth 2.1 - 3.3 mm; weight: 3.9 g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Amber bead. Yellowy-orange, semi-translucent amber, slightly damaged with chips mainly along one edge revealing fresher surface. Patches of bronze corrosion products are attached. Bun-shaped with faces ground flat or slightly convex and a bowed outer edge. Central near-cylindrical perforation. The outer edge thins on two opposite sides, possibly the result of wear from threads. Diameter: 17.3 - 17.5 mm; breadth 6.2 mm; diameter perforation: 4.2 mm; thickness 6.0 - 6.9 mm; weight: 1.2 g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Amber bead. Light orange, semi-translucent amber, complete with no damage. Spots of bronze corrosion adhere. Distinctly wedge-shaped in profile, the thinnest side also being the narrowest in plan. The offset perforation is slightly oval. Both inner and outer sides are well bowed leaving narrow flat facets on the faces. Diameter: 10.6 - 10.9 mm; breadth 2.0 - 4.5 mm; thickness: 1.7 - 3.4 mm; diameter perforation: 4.4 - 5.3 mm; weight: 0.2 g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Amber bead. Light orange, semi-translucent amber, complete with minor cracks and spalls partially polished out. Spots of bronze corrosion adhere. Near disc form, but of variable breadth and unequal thickness. Near cylindrical perforation, flattish faces and bowed exterior. Diameter: 9.5 mm; breadth: 2.7 - 3.3 mm; thickness: 2.0 - 3.7 mm; diameter perforation 3.8 mm; weight: 0.1 g.","fourFigureLat":"54.645685","fourFigureLon":"-1.412667","fromdate":"1000","todate":"800","notes":"This is Treasure Case 2005 T388","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"August 27, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"","quantity":"7","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sedgefield","county":"County Durham","district":"County Durham","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/2005 T388a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of Antiquities of the University and Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
