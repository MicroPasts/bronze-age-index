The object is the tip of a weapon such as a rapier, sword or dirk. The blade tip has a central mid-rib and a worn lozengiform cross section with broadly parallel edges, suggesting a long slender-tipped object like a rapier sword. Although there is some damage to the point and the blade itself is slightly bent the edges and overall appearance remain in relatively good condition. Long bladed weapons are thought to be for stabbing rather than slashing (Peter Reavill pers.comm.).","fourFigureLat":"51.55347551","fourFigureLon":"-1.42447023","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1140","notes":"\nAlthough several items of middle to late Bronze Age date were recovered from the surrounding area, these finds are representitive of general dispersed activity in the Bronze Age landscape.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Recorded at a rally","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.79","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wantage","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/WWsept13_Y676.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"51.96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
