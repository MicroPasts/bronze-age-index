The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side view of the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. \n\n\n\nIn cross section the body of the axe is H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been raised by hand hammering to form slight flanges. The flanges appear to have been cast and probably augmented by hammering. On both faces of the axe there is a slight bump / rib / proto-stop ridge, where the butt and the blade meet and the face of the axe changes angle. The thickness of the axe across the flanges is 12.6mm and the septum is 10.2mm thick at the proto-stop-ridge. There is no decoration present and the casting flanges have been trimmed filled and hammered flat.\n\n\n\nThe blade tip flares outwards from the body. One edge is angled outward, and the other is a concave curve. There is no obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge, although it does tapers giving a slightly blunt edge.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the axe has a well-developed dark green to dark grey patina. It is 92.8mm long, 43.1mm wide and 12.6mm thick. 108.1g.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III), of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC.\n\n\n\nThe axe seems similar to some Brandon types. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being \"notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. This example does not have a particular flared cutting blade. \n\n\n\nCompare also WAW-2779F8, LANCUM-FF1A46, YORYM-57D704 and SWYOR-3DAD49.","fourFigureLat":"54.00002205","fourFigureLon":"-2.04725522","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"June 30, 2018","datefound2":"October 17, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rylstone","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR8A8C71BronzeAgeAxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"92.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
