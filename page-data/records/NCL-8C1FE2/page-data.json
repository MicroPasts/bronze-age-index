The total (incomplete) length of the axehead is 113.42mm, with the blade (from the edge to the stop) comprising 67.18mm length and the septum/butt measuring 46.24mm in length. The flanges have a maximum breadth of 19mm, and the axe is thickest at the stops, measuring 11.82mm. At its widest, the blade is 40.2mm in breadth from tip to tip.\n\nThe stops are worn, but visible, and the axe looks as if it was used before it was deposited, based on the uneven wear of the blade. The butt is incomplete, but was probably rounded rather than flat-edged.","fourFigureLat":"55.347947","fourFigureLon":"-1.859628","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"January 01, 1997","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.82","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Edlingham","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/IMG_0123.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"113.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
