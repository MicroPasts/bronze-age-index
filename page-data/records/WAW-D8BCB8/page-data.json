In profile the item is relatively flat with a slightly undulating surface. The surfaces of the fragment are slightly undulating with one face having traces of a heavy patina and a turquoise/blue corrosion product. The surface is also slightly pitted with corrosion. It weighs 56.07g and measures 47.23mm long, 29.22mm wide and 9.43mm thick. The date is uncertain, but the turquoise/blue corrosion product but it may, tentatively be considered of a Bronze Age date.
