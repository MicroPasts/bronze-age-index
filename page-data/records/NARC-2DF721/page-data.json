The body is divided by a single midrib. The crescental blade is flared. The casting seams are clearly visible on the sides and there is no scar suggesting that a loop was present. Roughly 'H-shaped' in section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe axe is 170mm long. The cresent blade is 70mm wide. The blade tapers down to the handle, which is 20mm wide. The side is 26mm thick and has an eliptical shape in plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defination of a 'Palstave' axe is generally accepted to be an axe hafted by means of a forked wooden handle kept in place with high, cast flanges and stop bar. as such, this axe fits the category of palstave axe of Middle to late Bronze Age date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA brown patina on the butt and between the mid-rib is representative of its age, and it is in very good condition.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Cassidy","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Cassidy","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jcassidy/NARC-2DF721 PALSTAVE c.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"160"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
