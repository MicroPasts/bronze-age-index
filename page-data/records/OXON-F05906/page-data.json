It may have originally been more circular in plan. The terminals of the bar are slightly expanded (c.8.1mm diameter) and are sub-circular in section.  The bracelet is mostly a light green patina although has darker green patches near its terminal.\n\n\n\nThe bracelet is 68.1mm long, 38.5mm wide, and 8.1mm thick at the terminals. it weighs 20.64 grams\n\n\n\nSeveral bracelets with expanded terminals made of gold have been recorded on the database such as BUC-26FC86, NARC-10B4B1, HAMP-5E48D1 and IOW-65AD93 argued to be Bronze Age based on excavated examples in hoards. Similar copper alloy bracelets have been found in the Late Bronze Age hoards at Auchtertyre, Morayshire (O'Connor 1980: fig 55D), St Ishmael in Camarthenshire (NMGW-47D2BB), Northumberland (NCL-9F9F92), near Lancaster (LANCUM-A5AF1B), and Stourmouth, Kent (O'Connor 1980: fig 62A) each associated with Late Bronze Age artefacts often dating to the Ewart park phase (c.950-800 cal BC sensu Needham et al 1997). Occasional fragments have also been recorded on the database from Essex (PUBLIC-9EF82E) and Buckinghamshire (BUC-FFD1F1) although some copper alloy bracelets with expanded terminals have been described as Iron Age e.g. SUR-9ABB65 which is supported by a similar example described as Iron Age but found in an unknown context from France within the British Museum's collection (ML.1966).This artefact has been found in a region with several known Bronze and Iron Age finds such that it may date to either period.","fourFigureLat":"51.70260547","fourFigureLon":"-0.90163307","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"January 01, 2021","datefound2":"October 04, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chinnor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXONF05906.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"68.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
