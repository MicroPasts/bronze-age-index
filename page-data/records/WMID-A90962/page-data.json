The object is wedge shaped and triangular in section, tapering sharply from the break to the terminal. The dark green patina of the object is suggestive of a possible Bronze Age date, although it is not clear what function the object may have had. It appears to be too narrow to be the tip of a small socketed axehead and the angle of the taper is also too dramatic for this identification. The object does not clearly resemble any other Bronze Age tools or weapons.\n\n\nIt has a dark green patina and air bubbles in the metal show that it has been poorly cast. \n\n\nIt measures  19.47 mm long from the break to the terminal, 23.48 mm wide, 6.45 mm thick and weighs 10.3 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.346039","fourFigureLon":"-2.089501","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"February 22, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.45","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dodford with Grafton","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Bromsgrove","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-A90962.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"19.47"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
