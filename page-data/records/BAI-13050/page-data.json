There are side loops about 1 1/8\" from haft end, but the holes of these loops now blocked with, hard rusty, incrustation, which also occurs in patches on one face of the blade, and just inside the socket. The sides of the socket below the blade have been slightly flattened by filing - the marks of which show clearly. The base of the socket is slightly indented all round. Edges of blade badly chipped and blade also slightly cracked.","fourFigureLat":"52.9894346","fourFigureLon":"-1.03815423061068","fromdate":null,"todate":null,"notes":null,"materialTerm":null,"identifier":null,"datefound1":null,"datefound2":null,"subsequentActionTerm":null,"recorder":null,"gridSource":null,"quantity":"NA","height":null,"diameter":null,"edge":"","thickness":"","discoveryContext":"river,dredged","parish":"Burton Joyce","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"","regionName":null,"country":"England","patina":"Incomplete, blackish patina.","surface":"Smooth, unpitted, with very little corrosion, apart from incrustation mentioned above.
