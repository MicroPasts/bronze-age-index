The edges of the hole are jagged but worn, suggesting ancient damage. The hole is 5.59mm deep and conical. The underside tapers to 8.72mm wide before rounding at the other end.\n\n\nIn profile the object has a large hump at the wider end, 17.36mm tall. The underside is slightly convex at this point. The hump narrows and drops in a curve, the very end curling back upwards to a worn point 2.7mm in diameter.\n\n\nThe surface of the object is greeny-grey in colour with areas of heavy pitting.\n\n\nThese moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). Three other examples are known besides the nineteen-odd recorded on the PAS database. Some of these are single examples, while others are 'double' sometimes with a central perforation. This suggests the object was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small. Dr JD Hill feels these objects date to the Iron Age while Jody Joy and Ben Roberts suggest a Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.07817823","fourFigureLon":"-1.81580485","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"April 04, 2011","datefound2":"June 06, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Salisbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Guyatt0811unid.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"35.13"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
