The breaks are ancient and the fragment now very worn, although some knocks are recent. It is broken horizontally across the socket. The edges of the blade are worn although the bevelling is still visible.\nThe fragment is from near the tip and has broken across the socket to one side and the solid spear tip to the other. The spearhead is pointed oval in section with a broad flat mid-rib (socket 9xc.6mm).\nThe fragment measures 28x28x8mm and weighs 16.48g.\nSpearheads of the Middle Bronze Age tend to be well crafted and survive well in the ground. I am leaning more to a Late Bronze Age date for this fragment.","fourFigureLat":"51.37496504","fourFigureLon":"-2.14505634","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-701","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"June 29, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Melksham","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/DCspear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society","length":"28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
