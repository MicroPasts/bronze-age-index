The butt (with a width of 21mm and a thickness of 3.7mm) is moderately straight but bevelled and is possibly truncated on one side. The sides are near-straight and slightly divergent as far as the stop (with a maximum width behind the stop of 27.6mm). The casting seam is only evident on the unlooped side but is possibly masked by corrosion on the looped side. The seam appears to have been neatly fettled. The loop is of D-shaped section (25.0mm long, 12mm wide, 9.4mm high and 3.8mm thick). The sides are flat across their widths and onto the flanges. The flanges begin at the butt and have a linear divergence to the stop but have slight damage to the top edges. The septum is straight and flat and is perpendicular to both the flanges and stops (with a maximum height of 16.1mm). The stops are rounded with a slope to the blade (where the palstave has a maximum thickness of 37.4mm). The sides of the blade narrow below the stop, producing a slight 'nick'. The sides are straight across their widths and gently concave are divergent along their lengths to produce a narrow and moderately rounded blade edge. The original blade edge has been lost but there does not appear to have been any significant loss to the blade tips (with a surviving blade width of 44.6mm). The blade faces are decorated with a single central midrib, which appears as wide as the face below the stop, producing convex faces at the apex, becoming flat near the blade edge. There is a discernible blade facet where the midrib ends. The surface is heavily-corroded with a mid-green corrosion and dark brown exposed metal on edges. There are some areas of active bright green corrosion on both blade faces.\n\n\n\nThe palstave demonstrates a number of features characteristic of Type Roundhay such as the waisting and the near-parallel sides below the stop. The sides however are also straight and near-parallel above the stop, similar to Type Shelf (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 146). Transitional palstaves are recovered occasionally from South East Wales but are far less well represented than Ewart Park metalwork and may have a different pattern of deposition, with the coastal findspot of this example, perhaps being of significance.\n\n\n\n1.
