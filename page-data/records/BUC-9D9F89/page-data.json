It consists of two portions: a pointed blade tip that widens into the remaining small portion of the body and a terminal end, formed by the body then narrowing to a short neck before expanding out to form a sub-circular terminal end; it is not discernable whether the neck and sub-circular terminal are designed features e.g. notches or due to extensive corrosion.  The reverse of the object is flat but the front has as central rib with a bevelled edge either side, which meet the long edges of the blade. \n\n\n\nThe blade is dark grey in colour with patches of light grey and also a small amount of red patina.  It is very worn, particularly around the terminal portion and also has extensive surface pitting.  \n\n\n\nBroadly similar to: BERK-AB297D, LIN-E29A32, SUR-D3C182.\n\n\n\nDimensions: total length: 51.10mm, width: 1.80 - 15.54mm, thickness: 2.69mm, weight: 5.87g.","fourFigureLat":"50.49244747","fourFigureLon":"-3.55212023","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alexandra Cobby","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alexandra Cobby","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.69","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coffinswell","county":"Devon","district":"Teignbridge","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC9D9F89.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"51.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
