The blade length appears complete although the tip is flattened rather than pointed which suggests the very end is missing. The edges of the blade are uneven all the way around where small pieces have broken off. \n\nThe blade widens from the tip, reaching its widest point at mid-blade. It then begins to narrow to the waist. It widens slighly again to meet the hilt section. The section between the waist and the shoulder has a narrowing of the blade then a sub-trianglular section. This section would have led into the grip but it has broken before it reaches here. There are two circular rivets on this section, one on either side. The sword has broken just after the rivets.\n\nThe sword has an unven light green patina with patches of darker green and brown. It has some corrosion in patches on the surface. The hilt in particular has a lot of corrosion on.\n\nFits in Needham Period 7 950-750 CAL BC / Metalwork stage XII","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"January 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"","county":"Leicestershire","district":"","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fmcintosh/sword full length.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Liverpool","length":"555"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
