When viewed from the side, the flanges are rounded. Down one side is a narrow casting seam with hammer marks across it; in the centre of the opposite side is a side-loop.\n\n\n\nViewed from the front or back, the butt and the septum are rectangular. One face has a small casting flaw, a hole in one side of the septum by the stop.On both of the main faces there is a trident moulding just below the stop; this consists of three relief lines, one vertical and two curving from the edge of the stop ridge to meet the end of the vertical line, together forming a shield shape. Below the stop, the sides curve out in concave curves to meet the convex curve of the cutting edge. \n\n\n\nIt has a dark brown patina, worn away in places (notably on the stop ridge) to show the bright metal beneath; the breaks at the edge of the blade are not very worn and vary between a brown and a green patina. Length 155mm, width of blade 56mm, thickness at stop 32mm, weight c. 420g.","fourFigureLat":"52.82029385","fourFigureLon":"1.01121716","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Geake","datefound1":"January 01, 2018","datefound2":"February 28, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"32","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hindolveston","county":"Norfolk","district":"North Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/41334_MBA_Palstave_B0C7AA_ILL.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"155"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
