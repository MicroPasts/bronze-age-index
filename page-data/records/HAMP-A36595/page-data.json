It has suffered losses and is thus hard to identify, however the slight nature of the fragment may suggest a later dirk, small rapier, knife or dagger.","fourFigureLat":"51.234862","fourFigureLon":"-0.884158","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-700","notes":"This record was made at a rally and may thus fall below our usual standards of recording","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jodi Puls","datefound1":"August 20, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.275","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Crondall","county":"Hampshire","district":"Hart","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-A36595blade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"48.15"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
