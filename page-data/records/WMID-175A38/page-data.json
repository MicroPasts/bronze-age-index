The shaft is bent at the point where it meets the head of the pin. The pin shaft angles to the right towards the distal end of the pin. The head of the pin is circular in plan and circular in cross section, and is complete. It has an external diameter of 27.4 mm and an internal diameter of 20.6 mm. The pin is undecorated but does show evidence of silvering on the surface.\n\n\n\nThe pin measures 78.7 mm in length, and the head has a diameter of 27.4 mm. It has a thickness of 3.4 mm and weighs 6.4 g.\n\n\n\nThe pin is a mid brown in colour, with evidence of silvering in places, mostly on the front of the pin at the proximal (closest, or head) end. It has an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement in the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nDr Eleanor Blakelock (Birmingham Museums Trust) tested three areas on the pin using a Mistral Tabletop XRF machine. The areas tested were: a silvered area, a cleaned area that revealed silver from the surface layers, and the final area was further down the pin to assess the core metal composition. The XRF results would indicate that the pin has been silvered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest area\n\n\t\t\t\nGold (Au)\n\n\t\t\t\nSilver (Ag)\n\n\t\t\t\nCopper (Cu)\n\n\t\t\t\nTin (Sn)\n\n\t\t\t\nZinc (Zn)\n\n\t\t\t\nLead (Pb)\n\n\t\t\t\nMercury (Hg)\n\n\t\t\t\nIron (Fe)\n\n\t\t\n\n\nCleaner Silvered area\n\n\t\t\t\n0.00\n\n\t\t\t\n53.28\n\n\t\t\t\n20.20\n\n\t\t\t\n0.20\n\n\t\t\t\n3.45\n\n\t\t\t\n1.02\n\n\t\t\t\n0.00\n\n\t\t\t\n21.85\n\n\t\t\n\n\nSilvered area\n\n\t\t\t\n0.00\n\n\t\t\t\n38.51\n\n\t\t\t\n57.86\n\n\t\t\t\n0.32\n\n\t\t\t\n0.00\n\n\t\t\t\n0.21\n\n\t\t\t\n0.00\n\n\t\t\t\n3.09\n\n\t\t\n\n\nBase of pin\n\n\t\t\t\n0.00\n\n\t\t\t\n0.16\n\n\t\t\t\n82.61\n\n\t\t\t\n0.13\n\n\t\t\t\n0.95\n\n\t\t\t\n4.12\n\n\t\t\t\n0.00\n\n\t\t\t\n12.04\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\nOther examples of this type of pin can be seen on the Database, including SF9909, SOMDOR-839ED2, SF-81BA51, SF-54D866 and BUC-7C4708.
