This slender fragment appears to be from the tip of a rapier. The opposite end is broken, but this is not due to recent damage. The&nbsp;find has a sub-rectangular cross section. It has&nbsp;flat surfaces, which do not appear to have been deliberately bent prior to deposition. The&nbsp;edges of the blade are bevelled although these&nbsp;are now abraded and&nbsp;chipped. The surfaces of the blade are pitted and worn.\n\nDimensions: Length: 35.1mm; width: 13.8mm; thickness: 2.9mm; weight: 5.15g.\n\nThe find is consistent with many other rapier fragments recorded by the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;including&nbsp;OXON-7DE9EB, NMGW-587A08,&nbsp;SUR-BCF0BA&nbsp;and&nbsp;DENO-0EAF9.","fourFigureLat":"51.37501341","fourFigureLon":"-1.90081929","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1150","notes":"There are two other Bronze Age objects recorded in the immediate area: NMGW-598318 and SUR-8A4D82, but&nbsp;neither is likely to be close enough to be part of a scattered hoard, therefore this find is not being reported as Treasure.
