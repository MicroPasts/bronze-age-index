The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan, with convex expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical and worn and measures 47.55mm&nbsp;in width.\n\n&nbsp;In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the thickest&nbsp;section at the stop ridge.&nbsp;The object has a U-shaped septum and straight-sided flanges for hafting which are very worn. On one side of the palstave, in line with the stop ridge are two circular worn scars that are the remains of a&nbsp;single side loop. The object has a dark brown patina with patches of bright orange.\n\nDimensions: Length 113.44mm; width 47.55mm; thickness at stop ridge: 19.27mm; weight 221g.\n\nA wide variation of palstave types are known from throughout the Middle Bronze Age and this example is worn but&nbsp;has characteristics most similar with low flanged palstaves of&nbsp;Group III type&nbsp;(following Schmidt and Burgess 1981). This type mainly dated to theTaunton phase (1400-1275 cal.&nbsp;BC), but could extend into the Penard phase (1275-1100 cal.&nbsp;BC) (Needham et al. 1997).&nbsp;&nbsp;Other recorded examples include LVPL-4E864F; and&nbsp;WAW-33F1B7. However, the axehead also has features which are typical of some continental palstaves found principally in Northern France but which are also found in the south of Britain. A similar unlooped axehead from the Bais hoard with rounded stop, mid-rib and shield with a narrow blade is illustrated in Melin and Nordex (2019), Fig. 11 no: 152.
