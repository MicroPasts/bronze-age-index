Most edges are relatively recently damaged and show as pale green, though both&nbsp;sides of the blade expansion for the handle survives as&nbsp;original straight edges, indicating that this rapier had the rivets fully enclosed in a trapezoidal sheet Cua rather than the edges cut or cast with open &ldquo;slots&rdquo; for the attachment of the rivets, these are now damaged and the two rivets themselves are loose, but intact (each slightly bent with hammered&nbsp;ends, c. 16 x 5, expanding to 6.5 mm). The hilt constricts rapidly from the broad, flat hilt into the long, narrow blade of lenticular section, most of which is missing, broken transversely by an ancient break with little sign of bending prior to snapping. 1,600 to 1,000 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.40545518","fourFigureLon":"1.05639157","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1001","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"May 19, 2022","datefound2":"June 16, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jason Gibbons","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bressingham","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jasongibbons/Image2662.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"120.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
