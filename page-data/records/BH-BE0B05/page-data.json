The wings are bevelled and gradually expand before tapering inwards at the narrowest point of the shaft. The wing edges are very worn and damaged in several places. \n\n\n\nThe shaft is broadly sub-conical and circular in cross-section. It increases in diameter from the narrowest point to the open-ended socket. Small loops project part way along the shaft either side.\n\n\n\nThe surfaces of the spearhead have mid green patination with several areas of lamination revealing mid brown underneath. Pits and abrasions are evident across all surfaces.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 70mm in length and 13mm wide. It weighs 14.05 grams.\n\n\n\nThis spearhead is part of the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions and is dated to the Middle Bronze Age, between c. 1500 - 1150 BC. Several similar spearheads of this type are recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database.
