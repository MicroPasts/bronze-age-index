Some fragments of metal were still within the cracked vessel while others had dispersed slightly.\n\n\n\n61 sherds of ceramic vessel (possibly Deverel Rimbury ware). 21 of these sherds are extremely small fragments. At least two of the larger sherds cross-fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n8 fragments (of possible scabbard chape) with more than two sides.\n\n40 fragments of probable scabbard chape with two sides present (one with an interesting square notch at break), 10 of which seem to have shaped top edges.\n\n102 fragments of single side of probable scabbard chape (very thin sheet metal most but not all have at least one rib). One not photographed with the others.\n\n8 fragments that seem to be from a hollow artefact more solid than a scabbard chape. One has a circular notch at the break.\n\n21 fragments which have one or more rib on one surface and are fairly chunky/solid and relatively flat.\n\n8 fragments that have diagnostic features.\n\n143 fragments that are fairly solid and flat, almost none have any rib. 7 of which have incomplete notches on the break which may aid identification.\n\n9 other metal fragments. Mostly set molten drips or blobs, one piece that seems to be a circular cross-sectioned short length of wire. One looks more like a small dusty sherd of ceramic vessel but has a more metallic weight to it.\n\n2 fragments of cu. One is sheet metal with three sides, possibly scabbard chape. Another solid piece of metal is stuck within this three sided sheet metal. It is currently uncertain whether this is the remains of a blade within its chape or unrelated material lodged together.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal fragments of cu. = 341.\n\nTotal fragments of ceramic vessel = 61.","fourFigureLat":"52.04894892","fourFigureLon":"0.08392632","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Declared 'Treasure' at inquest 22/06/2022.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Fowler","datefound1":"April 30, 2017","datefound2":"May 30, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Helen Fowler","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"402","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Heydon","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"South Cambridgeshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
