There is evidence of a bevel and sharpening at the butt end but most of the edge is eroded. The butt has two clear rivet holes both damaged and incomplete but with sufficient to indicate a rivet diameter of 5mm. The tip and butt are both damaged and while much of the original surface survives with a dark brown patina, patches have been lost to corrosion. The dagger is similar in form to a dirk or rapier but its length (127mm) defines it as a dagger. It has similarities to daggers of the 'Camerton-Snowshill' tradition.","fourFigureLat":"53.097347","fourFigureLon":"-2.957241","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-900","notes":"\nPlease note that the second photograph was taken before any preservation work by the finder.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jeff Spencer","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rossett","county":"Wrexham","district":"Wrexham","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2227.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"127"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
