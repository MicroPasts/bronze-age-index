The cutting edge is on the vertical and is heavily abraded and corroded. In plan it is a slender elongated triangle which is slightly swollen along the centre of the lateral edges. The butt is also heavily abraded and corroded. The butt portion has a rectangular cell with an open end at the butt on the upper and lower face, thereby forming a 'H' shaped section. In profile the adze is a sub asymmetrical lozenge, with the butt tapering to a blunt point, and the blade portion of the adze having slightly concave sides and expanding in width at the blade. The surface of the adze has a well developed shiny mid orange/brown patina which is incomplete. It measures 111.29mm in length with a cutting edge 18.38mm wide, is 16.21mm wide across the butt/blade junction and weighs 113.5g. \n\n\nA very similar example has been recorded from Brokenborough, Wiltshire (WILT-DBCAF4) and on this example Brendan O'Connor commented:\n\n\n\n\n\n'This is a type known to Evans (Ancient bronze implements, p 85, figs  70-1).
