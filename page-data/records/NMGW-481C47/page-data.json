The incomplete mouth is sub-rectangular to oval (48.5mm x 34.4mm (surviving)) and similarly the top of the socket is sub-rectangular (32.0mm x 26mm (incomplete)). The top of the mouth is moderately flat and has the suggestion of two, possibly three of the casting runner stubs, now corroded and worn. The mouth moulding is ‘lip-like’ and is short (5mm) and rounded. The loop springs from the base of the moulding (26mm long, 11.2mm high, 6.5mm wide) and is complete, enclosing a rounded D-shaped aperture (8.5mm x 6.1mm) with low casting flashes evident on the interior. The sides are near-straight for their surviving lengths, narrowing beneath the mouth before beginning to widen towards the missing blade, above the break (where the axe has a width of 40.0mm and depth of 13mm). The casting flashes are evident on both sides but are finished and rounded. The axe has broken above the socket base, leaving a slender oval aperture (24.0mm x 5.8mm) at the base. The sides of the axe are gently convex across the widths, giving the axe a near rectangular body section. The faces are straight and gradually convergent for the surviving lengths. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs and there is the suggestion that the face sides have also been enhanced to suggest ribs. Both faces were damaged during antiquity.  A pointed implement has been used to punch through the upper part of one face and the missing part of the opposite face is likely to be a result of the same action. Additionally, it seems likely that the blade has been removed. The surface is heavily-worn and corroded with a mid-green patina and may have been heat-affected, as evidenced by the coarse and crystalline-like surface condition. There is the suggestion of a black patina, partially preserved, possibly tenorite.\n\n\n\nThe damage on the axe appears to be deliberate, suggesting deliberate destructive treatment of the axe prior to deposition. Blade removal of the axe is unlikely to have occurred during normal use and experimental archaeology has indicated that an axe has to be heated to a high temperature to remove the blade, possibly resulting in the suggested heat-affected surface.   \n\n\n\nThe axe is of clear South Wales type but also has minor variations to the typical form, specifically the lipped mouth moulding, the suggestion of ribbed edges to the face and a more rectangular, rather than hexagonal body section.","fourFigureLat":"51.89841221","fourFigureLon":"-3.29488981","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"34.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Talybont-on-Usk","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/NMWPA201942.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"66"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
