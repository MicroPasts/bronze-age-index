Length 45.1mm, width 37.1mm and 7.8mm thick. Weight 42.17g.\n\nThe butt and one of the blade tips are missing and the breaks are old. The blade of the axe was probably symmetrical in plan. The blade expands from the break at the top (the butt end) and originally the wing tips flared outwards abruptly and evenly. However on this example, one of the blade tips appears to have broken and then been re-modelled or re-sharpened in antiquity to form a gently curving edge rather than a flaring tip. \n\nSevere corrosion and resulting pitting has obscured any blade faceting or hammer rippling that may have existed.","fourFigureLat":"51.347885","fourFigureLon":"-1.78601","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"March 18, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frank Basford","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pewsey","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fbasford/IOW2007-10-33.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Isle of Wight Council","length":"45.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
