They are heavily abraded around the edges (with total or near-total loss of original edge) and do not fit perfectly together. However, they are likely to be two parts of a single object since they are of similar thickness and width, with the same lozengiform cross-section and central longitudinal ridge on both faces. They also have a very similar very dark brown and green patina. They were discovered approximately twenty-five metres apart.\n\nOne piece is long and narrow, the other is slightly shorter and wider, but tapering in width from one end to the other, so that at its narrow end it is less than two millimetres wider than the narrow piece. c. 1600 to 1000 B.C\n\nFragment 1 - Length: 46.0mm.
