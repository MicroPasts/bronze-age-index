The sides of the axehead look slightly raised on both faces but that is because the original surface, which has turned dark brown in colour, has only survived around the edges making it look crisper, and also on the blade above the slightly expanded but worn and rounded cutting edge. The axehead is sub-trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the butt end. The blade narrows towards the damaged butt end, but with almost straight sides. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now very pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away. \n\n\n\nSimilar slender flat axeheads with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar flat axeheads of Type Migdale from Scotland, Briach Moor and Morayshire on pp.41-42, pls.12-13, nos.143, 147 &155.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of slender Migdale type flat axehead from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall on p.400 & 453, pl.1, no.6.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Boscastle in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.3, 111 & 213.","fourFigureLat":"50.6246691","fourFigureLon":"-4.68758642","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-2000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"February 24, 2020","datefound2":"February 24, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Camelford","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8542.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"93"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
