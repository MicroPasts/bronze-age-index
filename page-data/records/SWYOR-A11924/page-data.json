It is a flat riveted knife-dagger type. The blade is slightly bent but seems to be almost complete. It has a mid rib on each face and the blade edges are bevelled. The sides of the blade are slightly convex, but are almost straight. At the hilt, they flare outwards and then meet to form a pointed end. A copper alloy rivet survives in the rivet hole on one side of the hilt. It is at the widest point. The other side is damaged and broken across the rivet hole. The rivet has expanded ends and is sub-circular in section. The organic hilt which would have probably been  carved from bone or antler is lost. None of the daggers on the PAS database have quite the same shape, but for other Bronze Age daggers compare KENT-8D3476 and LANCUM-EDDE97. Ben Roberts of the British Museum comments that: \"This example is of a sub-type that is larger (generally c. 10 cm), with two rivet holes, and which is  found throughout Scotland, Yorkshire and the Pennines (see Gerloff 1976,  165-168, nos. 286-294).\"","fourFigureLat":"53.656565","fourFigureLon":"-1.320579","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1600","notes":"\nThis object has been recorded from images kindly provided by the finder, and has not been examined by the FLO.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"August 31, 2010","datefound2":"December 01, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ackworth","county":"Wakefield","district":"Wakefield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1660_dagger.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"150"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
