It was manufactured using a relatively simple casting technique. It is very worn and chipped around the edges. However, a raised midrib and bevelled edges are apparent. The body of the blades are slightly concave. The tang is sub-rectangular , tapering slightly towards the end, which could be a break rather than a deliberate end. It has relatively crude notches between the tang and barbs. The chipping and wearing on the edges and body indicate use wear rather than post-depositional damage, and so suggest a long period of use for this object. The style of the arrowhead copies flint barbed and tanged arrowheads of the period. Copper alloy arrowheads of this style and dates are rare in Britain. Other examples recorded on the PAS database can be found at SF-4014B0, WMID-CE6A76 and SF6680. All other examples are stray detector finds and consequently the accurate dating of the objects is problematic. However, Dr. Colin Pendleton (SCCAS) notes that there is no reason to doubt that these are contemporary with Early Bronze Age flint examples of similar form.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Cassidy","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Cassidy","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jcassidy/sargent arrowhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"43"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
