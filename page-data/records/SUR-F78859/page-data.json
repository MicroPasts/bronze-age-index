About 40% of the original surface survives and is very pitted. Grinding marks are visible in a patch on the blade.\n\n\n\nThis is most likely to be a Primary Phase, Group I (unlooped), palstave with a shield-shaped depression below the stop ridge. The axe is of Middle Bronze Age date (1500 - 1300 BC) and is most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.\n\n\n\nUnusually the side flanges (which are fused to the stop ridge) seem to extend below the stop ridge as raised side flanges. There is an argument that this form of axe develops from the long flange tradition. It is worth also noting that the blade expands evenly until the end where it flares to form a fan-shaped cutting edge.","fourFigureLat":"51.61776959","fourFigureLon":"-1.88584904","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Margaret Broomfield","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Purton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/B15313.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"153"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
