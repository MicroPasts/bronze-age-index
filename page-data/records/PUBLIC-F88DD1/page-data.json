The blade of the palstave has straight sides that flare to form a crescent shaped cutting edge. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The two sides flare progressively from the butt to the raised and thickened stop. The flanges are fused to the stop and the septum of the axe is relatively plain and undecorated. The casting seams and associated flashes on either side (long edge) have been trimmed and hammered almost flat. An integrally cast side loop descends on one edge; it is positioned immediately below the stop towards the blade. The loop is D-shaped in cross-section.  Below the stop ridge of the axe on the upper blade is a central rib which continues towards the cutting edge of the blade, tapering to flatness at about 25mm from the cutting edge. The rib is present on both faces - although better defined on one. Each face has two further ribs which run from the butt to join the central rib at 20mm towards the blade - again one side is more defined. The palstave has a well-defined polished dark green/brown coloured surface patina which is pitted and broken in places, exposing areas of corrosion, particularly along the external and raised edges.\n\n\n\nMeasurments: length: 170mm; width (across the blade): 61.63mm; width (across the butt): 20.8mm; thickness (across the stop): 25.22mm; thickness (of the septum in the mid point of the butt): 7.14mm. The side flanges raise to a height of 9.2mm above the septum. The axehead weighs 387.6 grams.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: There is a similar but incomplete example on this database at DENO-07C564.","fourFigureLat":"51.42151911","fourFigureLon":"0.44362427","fromdate":"-1050","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Thompson","datefound1":"December 16, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Thompson","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25.22","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Higham","county":"Kent","district":"Gravesham","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ynwhsh7/bronzepalasteraxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"170"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
