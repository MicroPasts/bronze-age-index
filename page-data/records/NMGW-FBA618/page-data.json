The unbroken side is straight (for a length of 12mm) and is rounded across its thickness (with a maximum thickness of 4.5mm). The surviving blade tip is rounded and somewhat distorted, after which the surviving part of the blade edge is comparatively straight (42.9mm wide). Neither face has a discernible blade facet. One face is convex over its length, while the other is comparatively flat. All of the breakages occurred in antiquity and the fractures extend around the break. The damage on the axe may be consistent with deliberate damage. The surface has a dark-green patina.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The fragment shows no evidence of developed features and it is possible that the axe belongs to the earlier part of the sequence of tin-bronze axes, possibly of Type Migdale or Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1]. Axes of this date belong to Metalwork Assemblages III - IV, dated to c. 2200 - 1800BC.\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
