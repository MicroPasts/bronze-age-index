Square in cross-section throughout its length it tapers from its greatest thickness at the mid-point, to a moderately sharp point at one end, and to a chisel edge at the other. The object may have had a handle with one end functioning as the tang, but the consistent dark brown patina and hand-worn appearance probably suggest otherwise. Additionally, there is no evidence of hammering at either end; and no stop, and therefore the object was probably intended for light hand-work. Such objects are found in Bronze Age hoards- see WAW-C63EB7, but since they are commonly plain, lack diagnostic features and have simple purposeful forms that are relatively unchanged across many centuries, outside of context their dating is problematic. The landscape in which this object was found is ancient, and within a kilometre radius six Bronze Age artefacts have already been discovered, however, in recorded finds it majors in the Roman, Early Medieval, and Medieval periods. Accordingly, although a Bronze Age date is probable, for reasons given a wider date range is proffered.
