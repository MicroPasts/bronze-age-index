Middle Bronze Age. Copper alloy - bronze, cast, looped, relatively narrow palstave. Length 108.7mm, Width 27.8mm, Thickness 23.9mm, Weight 168g. This palstave has the stop-ridge fused to small flanges to form a pocket on each face of the tool which split or folked ends of the wooden handle could be attached. There was a single loop now missing added onto the lower surface of the axe to enable it to be fastened more securely to the haft. This has broken away in antiquity. Possibly resulting in the loss of the axe. This palstave has a plain blade of narrow shape with a fine casting seam. Approximately 70% of the axe has an olive green patina but there is surface corrosion on the rest with loss of the end of the butt and possibly some of the cutting edge of the blade. Ref.
