The axehead is very worn suffers from corrosion and wear, making it difficult to identify a close type. However, the lack of any evidence for an attachment loop may suggest that this is an early type of palstave. The flanges are relatively low, the axehead measuring 19.1 mm thick at the flanges. There appears to be no stop ridge differentiating between the flange and the blade, but this may simply be invisible through wear. The blade is damaged and worn. The axe measures 131.5 mm in length. It is 23.9 mm wide at the attachment end, expanding to 50.05 mm wide at the blade. It weighs 219.4 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.723616","fourFigureLon":"-1.912602","fromdate":"-1750","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"April 30, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Longdon","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-AD1E01.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"131.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
