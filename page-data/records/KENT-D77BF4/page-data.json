Possibly of Arreton type dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 BC or possibly of a Central European type known as a 'Randleistenbeil' dating to a similar period of time (Huegelgraeber-Bronzezeit Reinecke A/B)\n\n\n\nDescription: The axehead survives as the blade end and about a third of its original length. It has flanged parallel sides whcih runs along the back of the blades to the tip. The blade itself is a wide crescent shape with upturned corners. There is a very shallow stop ridge, now difficult to discern. Although not complete the flanges appear to narrow towards the body/butt end of the axehead. The axehead's surface is heavily patinated and pitted with some abrasion along the edges and the break is heavily abraded and likely having occured in antiquity.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 53.43mm long, 53.05mm wide, 13.18mm thick and 127.8g in weight\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The superficially seems to fit with the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 415, 422 and 425). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England. \n\n\n\nSimilar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c. 1750 - 1600 BC.\n\n\n\nThe very rounded blade shape and the flanges' meeting with the blade does however more closely resemble flanged axes / Randleistenbeile in use on the Continent during Bronzezeit A/B (Dot Boughton, pers. comms.)","fourFigureLat":"51.15759504","fourFigureLon":"1.30213879","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whitfield","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/flataxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"53.43"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
