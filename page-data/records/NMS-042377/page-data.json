There is some modern scuffing on the ends and surfaces, but the object is otherwise in good condition. The decorative style is close to that found on objects of the Middle Bronze Age 'Ornament Horizon' such as Picardy pins (e.g. NMS-35C944). The piece was formerly identified as Roman, its length being very close to that of a waisted tube with rather different decoration from Brough-on-Humber (Wacher 1969, 87, fig. 37 no. 6). Length 27mm. Diameter 11mm at one end, 13mm at the other and 9.5mm at the centre. The wall is 1mm thick. c.1400 - c.1250 BC.\n\n\n\nFound in area 13 on annotated map in file.","fourFigureLat":"52.642789","fourFigureLon":"0.525939","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Rogerson","datefound1":"November 01, 2012","datefound2":"February 22, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Rogerson","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"13","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Marham","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mchesterkadwell/34529_042377_RB_UnidentifiedObject.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"27"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
