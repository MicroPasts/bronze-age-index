The one surviving side on the axe is concave, flaring to the blade tip. The casting seam is prominent and raised but has been neatly finished by hammering (with a thickness at the side of 5.4mm). The sides are angled towards the casting seam and would have produced a sub-hexagonal body section. The axe fragment is widest at the blade (with a surviving maximum blade width of 33.6mm). The blade edge has a moderate curve and appears damaged and blunted, presumably by repeated impacts. The basal parts of three converging ribs are discernible on the more complete face, where the face appears to have been pounded repeatedly (with a thickness of 5.4mm). The base of the socket is evident on the interior (with a maximum surviving depth of 24.2mm). Sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces. The surface has a dark-green patina with patches of pale-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the axe makes a confident identification difficult but the surviving features of the axe are consistent with the South Wales type. The damage patterns on the axe may suggest deliberate damage to the axe prior to deposition.\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140","fourFigureLat":"51.43981874","fourFigureLon":"-3.29626369","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wenvoe","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.165jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
