In plan the object is a drop shape, and in section it is sub- semi circular which is domed on the outer face. The reverse is hollow. The lower half of the outer face is decorated with fine linear grooves and ridges. The upper edge of the object has a broken edge. The object has a dark brown shiny patina which is slightly abraded at the edges on the reverse. It measures 20.2mm long, 11.08mm wide, 7.34mm thick and weighs 2.8g.\n\n\nThese unidentified objects are referred to as 'moustache-like' or 'moustache shaped' objects which are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the early Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, I. M, 1998. The Salisbury Hoard : Tempus ref. 117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material. Dr JD Hill (British Museum) feels these objects date to the Iron Age rather than the Bronze Age.
