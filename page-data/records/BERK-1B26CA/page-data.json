Only part of the blade edge survives intact, the remainder now missing due to old breaks. The blade edge is flat, having narrowed from further up the axe head, and is convex in form. In cross section the fragment is solid and would have had an elongated lozenge-shape in plan. The fragment has a dark grey-green patina. This is a fragment from the blade of a Bronze Age axe, however due to the preservation of the object it is uncertain whether it belongs to a flat axe, a palstave or socketed axe however it is likely to be of Middle or Late Bronze Age date, and therefore dates to c. 1500-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.49959937","fourFigureLon":"-1.43955495","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"July 31, 2014","datefound2":"October 18, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Shefford","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2014575.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"14.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
