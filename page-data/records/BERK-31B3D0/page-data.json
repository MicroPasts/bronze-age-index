The object is now roughly oval in plan with a casting seam visible down one shorter round; the object narrows to form a broadly rectangular stem, which is now broken. The patina suggets a Bronze Age date and the form is reminiscent of the centre of some palstaves; between the blade tip and the stops.","fourFigureLat":"51.7565422","fourFigureLon":"-0.90032521","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1001","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aston Sandford","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013928.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"34.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
