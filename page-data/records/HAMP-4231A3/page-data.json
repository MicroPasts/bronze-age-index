The fragment is from the upper mid-blade towards the tip, but is missing the sword's point.  As such it is broadly trapezoidal in plan and lozengiform in cross-section.  The object has bent bent and now has a shallow serpentine profile.  It has corroded to a light, dusty blue-green colour with numerous scratches and pits.  It is likely to be from the late Wilburton or, most likely, Ewart Park phases of the Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.967303","fourFigureLon":"-1.146921","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"June 12, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Droxford","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-4231A3blade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"48.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
