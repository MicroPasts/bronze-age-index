The axe body is of sub-rectangular section at the break (with dimensions 28.9mm x 16.4mm). The socket is oval sectioned (22.3mm x 12.8mm and 8.5mm deep). The wall thickness is variable, considerably thicker on the sides (at 2.6mm) compared to the faces (at 0.9mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel, before expanding sharply to the slightly recurved blade tips (giving a blade width of 38.9mm) and producing a curved blade edge. The casting seams are evident on both sides but have ben neatly fettled. There are no discernible ribs on the either face. There is a point impact depression immediately below the break on one face and a rounded indent at the break on the other face. Both faces are moderately straight and convergent before converging more sharply at the blade but with no obvious blade facet. The surface is pitted and corroded with a dark-green patina. \n\n\n\nThe missing mouth makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively small size of the axe suggests that it is not of South Wales type but the form is consistent with axes of Ewart Park metalworking, dated to c. 1000 – 750BC.\n\n\n\nThe axe was reported with the socketed containing sediment which was removed at AC-NMW. At the base of the socket was loose organic fibrous deposits, possibly the remains of the wooden haft.","fourFigureLat":"51.82138675","fourFigureLon":"-2.87191739","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantilio Crossenny","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017291new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"45.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
