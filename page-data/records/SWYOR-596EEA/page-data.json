It is probably from Metalwork Stage IX, Needham Period 5; Taunton metalwork assemblage. There is a lozenge shaped flange on each side of the butt end. The blade tip is crescent shaped with a bevel on both faces of the cutting edge. The sides of the blade flare towards the currint edge, but are not curved. There is no obvious stop ridge for the handle to butt against, but the blade is thicker than the septum. There is a ridge between the blade and the butt on the external side faces, and along the centre line of each flange on the external faces. There may be slight damage to the butt. The axe has a brown patina, flaked off in places, greener on the cutting edge, and is in very good condition.\n\n\n\nThe object has a length of 164.29mm, a width of 69.54mm (across the blade) and a thickness of 35.95mm (across the apexes of the lozenge-shaped flanges). It weighs 434g. The butt is 22.7mm wide at the terminal and the axe is 29.1mm wide across the central ridges. The flanges extend along the full length of the butt end.\n\n\n\nCompare LANCUM-B39815, LVPL-C9CBCE and SWYOR-036213. Winged axes of the Taunton assemblage are more common in Northern England.","fourFigureLat":"54.00001505","fourFigureLon":"-2.06251041","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Chris Scriven","datefound1":"July 06, 2019","datefound2":"July 06, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Graham Rawson","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"35.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rylstone","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR596EEABronzeAgePalstave.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"164.29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
