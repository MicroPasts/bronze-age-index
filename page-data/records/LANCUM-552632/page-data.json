Only the main body and blade of the axe remain: the mouth and loop are missing. The mouth would have been rectangular with one small loop at the side. The main body of the axe is undecorated, and the axe looks well worn and resharpened. The casting seams at the sides were flatted and smoothed. Irish or bag-shaped axes are one type of Late Bronze Age socketed axes: they are quite short/stumpy and are seldom decorated with ribs or a more elaborate pattern.","fourFigureLat":"54.715982","fourFigureLon":"-2.855283","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"February 26, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dot Boughton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Greystoke","county":"Cumbria","district":"Eden","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dboughton/LVMDSG552632.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"55"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
