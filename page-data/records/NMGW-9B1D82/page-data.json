The butt is moderately straight and undulates slightly (with a width of 24.5mm and a thickness of 3.1mm). The flanges end just below the butt and rise to their highest point above the stop (with a maximum depth of 36.6mm and a maximum height above the septum of 14.5mm). The flanges have a slightly convex profile across their widths. The septum is concave across its width and the stop is of bar ledge form and is near-straight (with a maximum height above the septum of 12.5mm and 14.4mm). The sides of the palstave are straight and near-parallel, slightly divergent as far as the stop (with a width of 30.4mm), below which, they gradually become more divergent before expanding sharply to the splayed and recurved blade tips, now slightly damaged(producing a blade width of 62.0mm). There are subtle transverse ridges or ‘nicks’ on the sides below the stop (where the blade has a width of 32.2mm). The blade edge is asymmetric, partly through wear but with some damage at the centre. The casting seams are discernible but appear to have been carefully removed and finished on both sides. The flanges extend onto the top of the faces, flanking a central hollowing below the stop. The hollowing is coarse and unfinished but has a broadly ‘shield-pattern’ form. The axe faces are flat across their widths and their lengths before converging more sharply below a blade facet (17mm from the blade edge). The blade edge is corroded, with no surviving evidence for sharpening striations. One of the blade faces has striations running up the blade evident above the facet but beneath the patina, possibly finishing marks. The surface has a mid to dark-brown patina, largely preserved but damaged at the blade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe palstave demonstrates the characteristics of Primary Shield Pattern palstaves, but has a shallow depression rather than a moulding for the shield-pattern. This example with the recurved blade edge, slender body and of a smaller size the many Acton Park type examples, would suggest Type Colchester as defined by Schmidt & Burgess, (1981, p. 117).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
