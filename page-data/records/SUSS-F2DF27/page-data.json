The ring is circular in section and decorated with two transverse grooves of the outside. The remains of a casting seam can be seen on the inside, but this has mostly been polished away. It has a external diameter of 15.8mm and an internal diameter of 8.7mm. The hole is slightly off centre and the wider side is also thicker; at the maximum point the side is 4.5mm wide by 4.8mm thick and at the minimum point it is 2.6mm wide by 3.3mm thick. It weighs 3.4 grams.\nAlthough Bronze Age-Roman cast copper alloy beads with similar transverse grooves are known the distinct and apparently deliberate difference between the two sides may suggest this is a suspension or harness loop rather than a bead. The dark green patina supports a late Bronze Age - late Iron Age date range.\nWILT-70F237, WILT-50C040 and SUSS-C8CF13 all provide possible parallels.","fourFigureLat":"50.834616","fourFigureLon":"0.100378","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"42","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"August 31, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"15.8","edge":null,"thickness":"4.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Firle","county":"East Sussex","district":"Lewes","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lburnett/SUSS-F2DF27.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
