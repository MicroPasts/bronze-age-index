Stuart Needham of the British Museum suggested it may be from the middle - late Bronze Age 1,500 - 800BC). The fragment originated near the tip, both ends of the fragment are breaks. The breaks have the same glossy dark green patina as the rest of the surface suggesting the breaks occurred in antiquity. The fragment has a pronounced central midrib; on either side of the midrib the metal gradually thins towards the edges. There is a small notch missing from one side but this may have occurred whilst in the ground.
