The spearhead tip has a rounded mid rib with narrow wings. The wings are chipped, perhaps due to thinning of the metal from corrosion which may have led to some losses from the outer edge of each wing. The surface has a stable, slightly pitted, patinated surface of green-brown colour. The surviving length is 46.64mm, with a maximum width of 10.04mm (and depth of 7.80mm) and weight of 11.45g.\n\n\n\nA similar, though larger, example (LIN-CE5674) can be seen on this database.","fourFigureLat":"51.27507808","fourFigureLon":"-1.49963303","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alyson Tanner","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alyson Tanner","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tangley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT-D576F5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"46.64"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
