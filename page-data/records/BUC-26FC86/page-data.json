The terminals of the bar are slightly expanded and, from the photograph,&nbsp;appear sub-circular in section with short, incised linear decoration.\n\nDimensions: length: 101.5mm, width: 58mm, weight:113.4g (dimensions approximate and taken from photograph, weight provided by the finder).\n\nDiscussion: &nbsp;At the time of recording, this object appears to be the first Bronze Age gold bar bracelet, from Buckinghamshire, to be reported to the PAS scheme.&nbsp; Three comparable bracelets, but with slightly more expanded terminals, were discovered as part of a hoard (PAS-833958) in Milton Keynes, which was Late Bronze Age&nbsp;(c.1150BC-800BC).&nbsp; This hoard was processed as treasure and acquired by the British Museum (Treasure No.: PEE69; accession no.: 2002,0701).&nbsp;&nbsp;Other comparable examples recorded on the database, including: NARC-10B4B1 (2019 T1165; Late Bronze Age, c.1150BC-800BC) and three further bracelets found as part of a hoard (BERK-6870F5/6863E4/6863E4; 2004T348; Middle Bronze Age, c.1300BC-1100BC).&nbsp; Two similar bracelets can also be seen in the&nbsp;British Museum&#39;s collection: 1824,K/Armilla.17 (East Sussex, Middle to Late Bronze Age c.1400BC-750BC) and 1857,0627.4 (Ireland, Late Bronze Age c. 1150BC-750BC).\n\nConclusion:&nbsp;Consequently, in terms of age and the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","fourFigureLat":"51.87406119","fourFigureLon":"-0.9700912","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-750","notes":"Photographs kindly provided by the finder due to COVID-19 restrictions.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"","datefound1":"August 01, 2020","datefound2":"August 01, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alexandra Cobby","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Quainton","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/P1060904.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"101.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
