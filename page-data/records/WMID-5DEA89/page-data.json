In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is a stunted H shape. The butt is relatively thin and appears to have a rounded top, however this has been heavily damaged; the width at the butt is 14.8 mm (thickness: 4.46 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to above the blade where the sides splay to form the blade. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (11.03 mm). The sides of the axe have a raised ridge on the outside edge of the obverse and the reverse, with a concave dip (or septum) in the centre. There also appears to be a stop ridge or proto-stop ridge at the mid point of the axe. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 39.7 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead. The axe is a mid to dark brown in colour colour, with lighter brown colours on the surface, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 89.51 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 39.7 mm, width at the butt is 14.8 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 11.03 mm (Thickness of blade: 4.5 mm, thickness of butt: 4.46 mm). It weighs 86.7 grams.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to Aylesford Type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 60 - 61). These are the earliest of the 'developed' flat axes, and have been found along side Migdale type axes, which would suggest a similar date. These axes fit within metalworking stage IV, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Aylesford (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 26B, no 310a).\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
