It is 110.2mm in length with a socket diameter of 17x15.7mm (one side is slightly squashed). The internal diameter is 13.8mm.\n\nThe blade is 'flame shaped' and c.68mm in length. Almost all the original edge is damaged, apart from at the very base of the blade. The widest point is just above this, at 19.9mm. It would originally have been c.23mm wide here.\n\nThe mid-rib, as an extension of the socket, extends to the tip. This has been bashed on both sides by a hammer-like object and dented the socket/ mid-rib. This is ancient, and probably contemporary. It is not possible to tell how far the socket extended as the finder has repaired the spearhead with a bronze pin in the socket to hold the two halves in place.\n\nThe loops are slightly lower than the mid-way point between base of blade and socket end. They are c.18mm in length and flattish on the outside, being max.3.5mm wide. The internal measurement is 5-6mm long and 1mm wide.\n\nThe socket end is a little damaged as well as being slightly squashed. The body of the socket displays several purposeful light incisions. The patina is shiny and dark green in colour. The object weighs 48.69g BUT this is inclusive of the bronze pin used to hold both halves together.\n\nDates probably to the Taunton and possibly Penard phases, c.1450 to 1150 BC, although they are known to turn up in hoards of the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age, to c.1050 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.096028","fourFigureLon":"-1.744333","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-1050","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"September 30, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pitton and Farley","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Dixon1006spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"110.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
