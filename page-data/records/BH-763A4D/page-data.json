The date of the object is uncertain and could range from the Bronze Age through to the Roman period. The stud comprises a hollow, hemispherical head which is filled with remnants of blue enamel. From the base of this head there extends a rectangular-section, slightly tapering stem. The stem is bent and appears to be broken. The stud measures 18mm in length, with the head measuring 15mm in diameter. It weighs 6.69g.\n\n\n\nCup-headed pins are known from the late Bronze Age (Ewart Park phase), but these tend to be larger and do not have inlays or settings in the head; they are also very rare. O'Connor (Cross-Channel Relations in the Later Bronze Age (1980) 201, 560-1, fig. 71.3) lists only three from England, one from Scotland and one from the Netherlands, although they are said to be more common in Ireland (e.g. that illustrated in Megaw and Simpson, Introduction to British Prehistory (1979) fig. 6.37.3). Alternatively, an Iron Age or Roman date is possible.","fourFigureLat":"51.98948027","fourFigureLon":"-0.12274292","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philippa Walton","datefound1":"December 09, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philippa Walton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"15","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wallington","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"North Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pwalton/bh763a4d.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"18"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
