The fragment was apparently broken and distorted in antiquity. Microscopic examination suggests the fragment is encrusted with ferrous and manganese oxide corrosion products presumably derived from the burial environment. Original blade width c.51mm, surviving height of fragment 40.5mm, maximum surviving thickness 13.5mm, weight 66.2 grams.\n \n\n \n Unfortunately, the fragment is not large enough to determine the specific type of the socketed axe. Socketed axes are a Late Bronze Age type and their use dates from approximately 1250BC to 750BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.394872","fourFigureLon":"-3.294993","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Philip MacDonald","datefound1":"April 30, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barry","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
