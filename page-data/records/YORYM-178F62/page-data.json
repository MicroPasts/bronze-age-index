The fragment is the blade end of a socketed axehead, which is trapezoidal in it's surviving shape with a worn cutting edge and rounded corners. The cross-section is rectangular, bulging slightly at the waist, and the breaks are old and worn. There is no trace of the socket at the broken end.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a pale green patina for the internal metal; at the surface it is a darker green-brown in colour and is delaminating. The fragment is 39.7mm long, 24.4mm wide, 11.8mm thick and weighs 38.3g.\n\n\n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.82958952","fourFigureLon":"-0.55808244","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mr Adam Parker","datefound1":"August 24, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mr Adam Parker","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishop Burton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adamparker26/YORYM_178F62.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"39.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
