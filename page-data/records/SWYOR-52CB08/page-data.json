The spearhead has a prominent central midrib which is lozenge shaped in section with a sub circular opening. The shape of the blade is, perhaps, diagnostic of side looped spearheads, probably Davis Groups 5-7. Both ends of the spear head are missing; the cutting edges and parts of the blade wings are worn and damaged; some of the material has been cracked/split and bent backwards. The spearhead has a dark orange brown patina with flecks of green throughout, shading to green and dark brown at the edges; where the tip has broken off, the material is corroded and is covered with an orange patina. It is probably either a kite-shaped or leaf-shaped spear.
