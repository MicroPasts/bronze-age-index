The axehead is 51.48mm in length from damaged blade end to mouth with a body width of 16.72mm and weighs 114.2g. The thickness of the body is 5.37mm. There is a single mouth opening, sub-rectangular in shape with an external width of 37.53mm and an internal width of 28.06mm. The width of the damaged body/blade end is 30.25mm. The loop is 21.49mm in length, 7.79mm in width and is 12.14mm from the mouth. \n\nThe axehead has a green-brown patina and is substantially damaged at the mouth, moulding, and body, with signs of active bronze disease. This damage is particularly heavy along the blade, with the cutting edge completely missing. There is a vertical scratch, probably done in antiquity, down the centre of the face 25.55mm in length. This extends from the moulding to the damaged area of the body/blade. This damage is a substantial irregular rectangle shape, which also appears to have been done in antiquity. The casting seam is visible on both sides of the body, extending from the mouth and terminating at the damaged end of the blade. There is a crack extending from the seam at the damaged point of the blade on the opposite side from the loop. \n\nThe axehead is probably of a South Eastern plain type.","fourFigureLat":"53.489024","fourFigureLon":"-0.645021","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Murphy","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Murphy","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.37","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Scotter","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/helenm/LVPL-3E6D90.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"51.48"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
