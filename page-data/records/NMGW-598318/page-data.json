The hilt has broken through a rivet-hole, positioned off-centre (with a diameter of 4.2mm). The hilt has a lenticular section at the break (2.0mm thick at the break and 3.2mm thick at the shoulders), becoming lozengic at the shoulders. The sides of the hilt are moderately straight and diverge slightly towards the shoulders (with a width at the break of 12.6m and 15.0mm above the shoulders) and both sides appear to have been blunted (with a thickness of 1.3mm). The shoulders are expanded (where the blade has a maximum width and thickness of 16.9mm and 3.4mm respectively). Below the shoulders, the blade narrows sharply to produce a rapier type blade profile (with a width and thickness at the break of 6.0mm and 1.6mm respectively). The top of the blade has a defined mid-ridge, with the suggestion of a flat-topped ridge near the break. The original blade edge has been lost and it is now uncertain whether any of the damage relates to its contemporary use.  A curve at the break indicates that the blade was bent prior to breaking. The surface has surviving remnants of a mid-brown patina over a darker-brown corrosion\n\n\n\nThe comparatively long hilt with central rivet placement does not correspond with typical wide and trapezoidal butted dirks and rapiers, usually secured with side rivets or notches. The blade width is also unusually slender. The fragmentary condition of the weapon makes a definitive identification problematic, however it is possible to suggest that the weapon was reworked from an earlier blade. Rapiers were in use in Britain principally through the Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries of the Middle Bronze, dated to c. 1400 â€“ 1100BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.37501341","fourFigureLon":"-1.90081929","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lydiard Tregoze","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2016141.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"67.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
