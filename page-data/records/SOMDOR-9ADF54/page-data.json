Late Bronze Age (1150BC-800BC). Ogival with lozenge shaped cross section, sharp median ribs and flattened edges with a slight rib front and back. The mouth of the chape is wide and open with deeply in-curved upper edges. The butt has a solid oval boss with a convex end. There are three ridges around the sides of the boss. The chape then flares out before curving back in to form an ogee shape and tapering to the round ended, oval sectioned butt. The chape is damaged and incomplete at both top and base and has been broken in two (the pieces were found separately on two separate occasions). The distal end of the chape contains blackened casting debris. Similar examples can be seen in H. N. Savory, 1980, Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections, National Museum of Wales - Figs. 36 & 37, pp. 118-9 and 184-5, especially no. 55 for the mouth.
