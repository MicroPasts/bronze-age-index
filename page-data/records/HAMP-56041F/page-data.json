The blade has a lenticular cross section with a low midribe which is distinctly flattened on the top. This flares out into a triangular area at the hilt. There&nbsp;are flanking contractions or rivet holes&nbsp;at the junction between blade and the hilt, which has&nbsp;a thinner section and is trapezoidal in shape.\n\nThis object is likely to be a reworked rapier or dirk blade fragment which was repurposed at a later time. Without the entirety of the blade the original type is unclear, but this compares favourably to&nbsp;one of Burgess and Gerloff&#39;s (1981) Group IV: Notched butt weapons with reworked butts, e.g. Nos. 898-950&nbsp;(Burgess and Gerloff 1981: Plate 110) and is probably part of the later Penard or Wilburton metalwork assemblage.&nbsp;Similar re-used blade fragments are recorded&nbsp;on the database:&nbsp;SF-E9C52D&nbsp;OXON-8AD684&nbsp;and&nbsp;SUR-B7F695.","fourFigureLat":"51.08439423","fourFigureLon":"-1.17332349","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"New Alresford","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMP56041F.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
