The ring has an internal diameter of 60.5mm. The exterior surface is decorated with incised or engraved panels with complex geometric decoration. Half of the hoop is decorated with a long panel of incised basket weave style pattern comprising oblique groups of nine lines interleaved alternately. This pattern terminates on one end with a panel of transverse lines and at the other end with a panel of diamond shapes. These each meet a panel of seven parallel strips of herringbone pattern running in line with the circumference which in turn bound a central panel comprised of two bands of nine parallel transverse lines either side of a narrow band of short parallel lines. This appears to be a focal point for the decorative scheme, perhaps suggesting an orientation to the bracelet in terms of its intended presentation.The decorative panels are bound on either side by a flattened internal margin of herringbone pattern running around the inner edge on both sides. \n\n\n\nThe surface of the object has suffered extensive damage due to post depositional corrosion and was found firmly embedded into clay.","fourFigureLat":"50.97386751","fourFigureLon":"-0.86193627","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1275","notes":"Incised (Liss-type) bracelets in copper alloy are not common finds. They are known from the Taunton phase (1,400 -1,200 BC) of the Bronze Age onwards, mainly from Southern Britain. These bracelets concentrate in the southern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and West Sussex and examples are also known from Suffolk and Norfolk. Incised decorated bracelets form part of a North European tradition, which has led to the suggestion that the examples from southern England may be imported from northern France, although this theory has been questioned (O'Connor 1980).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"92.1","edge":null,"thickness":"15.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harting","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMP86DD8Aa.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
