This fragment weighs 25.20g and is from the distal butt-end of the blade. The fragment has a pointed-oval to shallow lozenge shaped cross-section and all of the edges are worn. The fragment has an incomplete length of 38.6mm, maximum width of 35.1mm at approximately 20.6mm in from the butt-end and maximum thickness of 4.6mm. The butt-end is a relatively straight line with rounded corners and width of 29.5mm. The fragment's sides angle inwards, tapering towards, the now missing, blade tip. The blade has a, slightly diagonal, very worn transverse break and a width of 23.2mm. The break of slope on the change of angle along the edges, on both sides, of the blade is c.8.5mm in from the edges. Two circular rivet holes are present at the butt-end. One is positioned 4.5mm in from the butt-end and 1.9mm in from the side edge. This aperture has a diameter of 6.9mm. The other rivet hole is positioned 6.9mm in from the butt-end and 0.8mm in from the side edge. Being so close to the edge the metal between the aperture and edge has broken and the metal has pulled apart, one break above the other, creating a gap of 0.6mm. A rivet remains in place through this hole. The rivet has a sub-circular cross-section with a diameter of 6.5mm, which fits securely into the aperture, and length of 11.1mm. The rivet has a shallow domed head which expands slightly from the diameter of the shaft, probably due to being hammered on both sides to secure the rivet in place thus to hold the blade to the hilt. The head has a more oval diameter of 7.1mm x 6.4mm the head at the other end of the rivet measuring 7.1mm x 6.9mm. Peter Reavill suggests that the condition of the mushroom headed rivets is likely to indicate that the hilt was still attached to the blade when it went into the ground.\n\n\n\nThese types of artefact were made by casting in moulds. This artefact is too incomplete to be able to suggest a specific type of dirk.
