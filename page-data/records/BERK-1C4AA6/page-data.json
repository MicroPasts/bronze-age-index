The spearhead has a slender, tapering leaf-shaped (ogival) blade with slightly bevelled edges and two undrilled lozenge-shaped side 'loops' located near to the mouth of the socket, which is circular in plan and tapers internally. The spearhead is in good condition with some bronze disease and corrosion evident.\n\n\n\nThe loops may have been miscast as they are solid rather than having on internal eye. Spearheads with similar miscastings have been found locally; one from the same parish as this new example, now in the Ashmolean Museum (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706), another from Standlake (Ash.M. 1911.137) and a third recently recorded only c. 1 kilometre from this new example (BERK-5BCE29 on this database). Ehrenberg (1977:7) suggests that such miscast examples or those with unmade loops may indicate that the shaft of the spear was simply wedged in to the socket and not secured by strings. The shape of the blade may be the result of resharpening (Ibid; after Davey 1973:79).\n\n\n\nThe internal diameter of the socket is 13.65mm.\n\n\n\nRef: Bronze Age Spearheads from Bucks, Berks and Oxon.
