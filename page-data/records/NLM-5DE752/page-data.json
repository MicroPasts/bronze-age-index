Cast axe with a crescentic cutting edge, a plain and gently tapering body lacking any external ridging, a semi-circular loop whose inner end coincides with a low moulding for a round collared mouth of external diameter 32mm; within the socket the mouth achieves a sub-rectangular shape. A ridge of length c.30mm appears within the socket on either side, and was perhaps intended to enhance the grip of the axehead on its haft. A mould line appears all around the external median line of the axehead, centred on the upper and lower sides. The cutting edge remains sharp. The plain exterior and the size recalls that of socketed axes from Caythorpe 1 held in Lincoln Museum (Davey, P. 1970, Later Bronze Age Metalwork from Lincolnshire [volume 1], B. Phil. Dissertation for University of Liverpool, pages 81-85), for which parallels are cited (ibid. page 94) from Roxby, Haxey and West Halton, North Linconshire.
