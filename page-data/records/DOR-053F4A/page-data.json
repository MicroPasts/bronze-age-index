At one end is a long, tapered tang with a sub-angular cross section. The tang extends to approximately one third of the overall length of the implement. From here the it expands into a faceted hexagonal profile. This then tapers to a rounded point forming a conical awl.\n\nLength: 105.39 mm\n\nDiameter: 7.47 mm\n\nWeight: 20.1 g\n\nSmall tools of this type were used for an extensive period of time, not simply in the Bronze age, but also in later periods for jewellery making and fine work. Peter Reavill (pers comm) suggests a Middle to late Bronze Age date and comments that whilst such tools are also found in later periods, this is is less likely to be Roman or later as iron would be preferable at that date.","fourFigureLat":"50.67254313","fourFigureLon":"-2.51081423","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Megan Gard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rachel Mowbray","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"7.47","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Portesham","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/053F4A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"105.39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
