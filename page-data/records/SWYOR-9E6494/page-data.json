The axe is incomplete; it is missing the mouth and upper part of the socket including the loop and is broken below the mid-point. Due to the damage classification is difficult. It is likely that this axe fits within the socketed and faceted axe typology probably associated with the Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and earlier phases of the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-750 CAL. BC.\n\n\n\nThe axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a slightly flared / expanded, convex, but much abraded, cutting edge. In profile the fragment is sub-triangular / wedge shaped. The socket is also sub-rectangular in cross section with the side walls tapering evenly to a narrow rectangular base. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to base of socket is 6.7mm. The broken edges are all well abraded and patinated suggesting the damage is old. Both the casting seams (which run down the sides of the axe) show signs of finishing (being trimmed and flattened). The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is relatively poorly preserved. The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion. The axe fragment is a mid brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost leaving light green / grey corrosion visible.\n\n\n\nThe axe fragment measures 24.4mm long, 42mm wide, 13.3mm thick and is 36.69g. The walls are 3.6mm to 5mm thick. It can be compared to HESH-B617D3, KENT-ECBAFE and SWYOR-7C54E2.","fourFigureLat":"53.36512432","fourFigureLon":"-0.8292977","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"January 11, 2015","datefound2":"January 11, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bole","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Bassetlaw","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2501_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"24.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
