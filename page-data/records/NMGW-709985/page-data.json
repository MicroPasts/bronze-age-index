The shoulders are eroded but are probably close to their original width (with a surviving width of 39.2mm). The original form of the hilt is now uncertain and there are no definitive arcs from rivet holes present along the edges although it is possible to suggest an arc at the apex, towards the more complete shoulder side. The butt is thinned (with a thickness at the apex of 0.8mm) and may have been reworked. Below the shoulders, the sides are gently concave (for 24mm) before becoming near-straight and convergent (for approximately 82mm) before converging more sharply above the tip. The blade outline is comparatively triangular and perhaps suggests a Group II blade. The blade section is now difficult to determine with no midrib or mid-ridge discernible although there is the tentative suggestion of ephemeral surface marks or facets. The blade achieves a maximum thickness (of 2.3mm) below the butt and gradually thins to the tip (at 1.4mm thick).\n\n\n\nThe blade edges have been lost and are now rounded on one edge and stripped on the other. The original surface has been lost and the metal is heavily-corroded with a grey-brown to black patina and with areas of pale-green corrosion. There is no surviving evidence for a hilt mark on the surface.","fourFigureLat":"51.60161274","fourFigureLon":"-3.95064992","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1200","notes":"The blade has bowed slightly along its length in both directions so it has a low wave-like side profile. Due to the thin nature of the blade, this could be the result of soil warping or another post-depositional process. Alternatively, it may be the result of heat warping, as seen on burnt Early Bronze Age daggers, or deliberately distortion by some other means. The poor surface condition is indicative of burning damage.\n\n\n\nThe corrosion and peripheral damage makes it difficult to confidently identify the blade typologically with the scheme as outlined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981) but the triangular form would seem to best fit the Group II weapons with damaged or reworked butts. Group II have a suggested date range spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age transition (ibid., p 45), and largely belong to Acton Park Metalworking industry but continue into Taunton Metalworking, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 4 - 5, and perhaps can be dated to c. 1600 - 1200BC.\n\n\n\n1.
