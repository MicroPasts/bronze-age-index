The palstave is incomplete and damaged. The plastave is sub-rectangular in plan, with inwardly curving edges which extend outwards to the blade end, and the edges narrow towards the butt end. The blade has a curved cutting edge, which shows signs of damage. The blade appears to be plain, with no ridges present, however the surface is beginning to corrode which may have obscured some details. The prominent flanged edges are damaged towards the butt end. The flange continues along the blade edges beyond the stop. The flanges curve inwards towards the septum. There is an incomplete loop protruding from one side of the palstave, located above the stop towards the butt end. Approximately one third of the loop is missing. The loop is semi-circular with a central oval perforation. The surface of the plastave is corroded, with patches of a dark olive green patina showing through the corroded layer. The butt end and the septum are highly damaged, and the upper surface of the metal has been removed.  The profile and cross section of this plastave is unknown. The palstave is 130mm long, 35mm thick. It is 40mm wide across the cutting edge of the blade, and 32mm across the position of the loop.","fourFigureLat":"51.829274","fourFigureLon":"0.291472","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"Not seen by FLO.
