The tang has a short edge at its apex (1.3mm wide and 0.4mm thick) and is square-sectioned for nearly one-third of its length (for 27mm), gradually widening (to a maximum square-section of 3.7mm). The mid-part of the tool is circular-sectioned (with a diameter of 4.3mm) for a little over one-third of its length (for 31mm). The blade is sub-square sectioned (for 32mm) and each of the four faces on the top of the blade has a clear forged facet, which is possibly decorative. The lower part of the blade is sub-rounded and worn to the angled short chisel-like edge (2.5mm wide). The surface has a rich dark-green patina with the suggestion of more abrasion from one point, possibly suggesting the position of the end of the handle (approximately 37mm from the tip).\n\n\n\nTanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The deep patina and attention to detail with the decorative facets, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date. Bronze Age awls and narrow chisels are not common finds and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC. In Wales a socketed awl (Savory 1980, p 127, no. 307) was recovered from The Great Orme, Conwy associated with a palstave of Late Type and of Ewart Park metalworking.\n\n\n\n1.
