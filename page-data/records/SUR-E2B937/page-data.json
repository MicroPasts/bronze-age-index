The loop and collar are missing and the casting seams are filed smooth. The socket extends below a constriction into a void which fills the interior of the blade. This has resulted in distortion of the blade, which has split across its width, leaving one side of the blade bending outwards. The void within the blade appears to be a casting accident when, perhaps, part of the central core dislodged during casting. A similar feature was noted on a socketed axe found in a hoard of axes at Woodcote, south London.","fourFigureLat":"51.56059","fourFigureLon":"-1.121444","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Crowmarsh","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/B12-465.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"67.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
