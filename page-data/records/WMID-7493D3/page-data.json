The axehead is complete and well preserved, though it suffers from bronze corrosion in places and the surface is pitted in parts. It is unlooped and has a high flange. The septum of the flange is 17.55 mm wide. The flange ends in a stop ridge at 66.3 mm from the butt of the axe. After the stop ridge the blade is recessed, flattening and expanding to a crescentic terminal, 73.55 mm wide. The axehead is 28.91 mm thick at its thickest, at the stop ridge. It is 24.3 mm wide at the butt. It is 163 mm in length. This axehead is unlooped and the blade is undecorated. Slight denting of the blade may indicate use, as the damage does not appear to have occurred recently, though it could have occurred after deposition. The axe has a dark green patina where it survives, though where it is pitted it is a paler green or dull brown and there is a bright blue/green and reddy brown corrosion product in places.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"March 31, 2010","datefound2":"April 29, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.91","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stoneleigh","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Warwick","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-7493D3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"163"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
