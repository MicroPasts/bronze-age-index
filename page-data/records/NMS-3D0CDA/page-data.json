The H shaped hafting channels at the butt are well developed with high side  flanges to support the split wood handle, the end of the butt terminates in an oblique angle, this is most likely due to a casting flaw at the top of the mould, it looks unlikely that this is post-depositional damage. The axe is complete, though there are small losses to the thin cutting edge. Most of the surfaces are patinated dark brown, indicative of being deposited in a watery location, there are some slight green patches to one side of the hafting channel, the other face has some small recent scrapes revealing the original colour of the metal. \n\n\n\nMBA material is frequently found in very good condition with this brown patination around the Fen edge and other similar landscapes. It is very likely this piece represents intentional votive deposition.","fourFigureLat":"52.53564023","fourFigureLon":"0.49028937","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jason Gibbons","datefound1":"October 31, 2020","datefound2":"October 31, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Methwold","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jasongibbons/Image6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"148"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
