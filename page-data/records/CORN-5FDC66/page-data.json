The socket mouth is 27 mm long and 17 mm wide, which is quite unusual. The collar is 10 mm deep with a side loop on one side of the axe, 5 mm below the collar. The side loop is 18 mm long with an aperture that is 6 mm in diameter. Above and below the side loop there is a casting seam which continues down the side of the axe and which is also on the other side, but has been chiselled flat, apart from a slight ridge above the side loop. There are minor facets down the sides of the blade faces. The blade has turned-up corners, so that the side edges of the blade are almost at right angles to the body of the axe. There are some patches of green corrosion product on the surface, but the axe has been treated in the past and is now stable. Socketed axes with rectangular socket mouths, plain collars and crescentic blades can be found during the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1275 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age. This axe shares similarities with the Taunton-Hademarschen axes, but also with the Type Meldreth axes with faceted bodies which date from the Wilburton metalwork phase (c.1150-1000 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. \n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar socketed axe with a broad plain collar that is rectangular in plan, from Kirkton of Kingoldrum, in plate 70, no.985, which is classified as a Type Taunton-Hademarschen axe and dated from the Taunton metalwork phase; and a similar socketed axe with a broad plain collar and a crescentic blade from Monmore in plate 82, no.1216, which is classified as a Type Meldreth socketed axe and dated from the Wilburton metalwork phase.\n\n\n\nA similar example of a small socketed axe with a thick collar and rectangular socket mouth, but not a crescentic blade, is illustrated in Pearce (1983) on page 628, plate 67, no.564, which is associated with the Taunton phase of metalwork","fourFigureLat":"52.8478721","fourFigureLon":"-1.37781314","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"September 25, 2002","datefound2":"September 25, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"In a private collection, recorded for academic use","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"23","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weston upon Trent","county":"Derbyshire","district":"South Derbyshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June16finds196.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
