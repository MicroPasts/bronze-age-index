The item consists of a rectangular body, 41.9mm in length, 25.76mm in width and 18.76mm in thickness. The top edge of the body is faceted, with a ridge in the centre and two faces sloping down on either side. When viewed from the side, the body of the anvil is pentagonal in shape. There is a sub rectangular projection on the bottom edge of the body approx. 28.08mm long and 6.93mm thick. This projection is sub-ovoid in cross section, and tapers to become thinner both in width and in thickness toward the end.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe object has a rough surface and a green patina covering all faces. There is brown staining that could be from a ferrous material on the top and side edges of the body.\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions (entire object): weight: 148.75g, length: 51.21mm, width: 41.9mm, thickness: 18.76mm\n\n\n\n\n\nFor similar items on the database, see HAMP-7C41DB and  KENT-0278AC","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sophie Flynn","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sophie Flynn","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/slflynn/ESS3965F0.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"51.21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
