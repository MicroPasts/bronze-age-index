The blade of the spearhead is leaf-shaped with gently curving edges, the tip of the spearhead missing. The socket is triangular and tapers from the base to the tip of the spearhead. On both sides (8mm above the base) is an integral loop, both of which are truncated. On both sides above the loop (33 mm from the base) is a small rectangular hole, this is presumably a result of the manufacturing process and could be were a pin held sockets core during casting. The aperture at the base (16mm in diameter). The spearhead appears to be undecorated, but corrosion has removed the entire original surface leaving a pitted exterior. This artefact dates to 1500-1150BC, see WAW-DC8222 for further discussion.","fourFigureLat":"51.24796284","fourFigureLon":"-2.5314936","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"December 01, 2013","datefound2":"January 01, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chilcompton","county":"Somerset","district":"Mendip","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/DSC1192.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"116"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
