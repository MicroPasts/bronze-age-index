The fragment is extremely abraded, leaving no surface detail and at one point wearing completely through the wall, leaving an irregular perforation. The socket mouth and cutting edge have both been lost to wear, leaving the axe with a narrow sub-rectangular in plan, with a rounded blade-end and the wall of the socket lost entirely on one face. In profile the axehead tapers towards the cutting edge. the socket is sub-rectangular in cross-section and survives to a depth of c. 54.7mm.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 72.0mm; width 34.8mm; thickness 24.0mm; weight 75.61g.\n\n\n\nThe probable axehead (although it could potentially be from another form of socketed tool, such as a chisel) is too worn for its form to be paralleled, however a Late Bronze Age date is likely.","fourFigureLat":"50.76903937","fourFigureLon":"-2.90892472","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"January 01, 2017","datefound2":"September 18, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"24","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whitchurch Canonicorum","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEV3B1474.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"72"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
