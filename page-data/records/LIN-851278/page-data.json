The piece is roughly D-shaped in cross-section with a smooth curved upper surface and a generally smooth flat base though there are occasional irregular ribs. In plan the object is elongated and gently tapers. Either end is roughly broken, though both have a hollow cylindrical opening. The object could therefore be a failed casting , though it is difficult to see what it was trying to be, and why the manufacturer would not have melted this down again.","fourFigureLat":"52.893206","fourFigureLon":"-0.4407","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"January 01, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walcot Near Folkingham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"North Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN8420C.JPG.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"127"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
