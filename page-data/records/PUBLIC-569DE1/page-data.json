The butt is thin or sharp and arched (with a width of 36.9mm and a thickness of 2mm). Both faces are convex, giving the axe a lenticular body profile, with the thickest point (at 12.5mm) on the blade, approximately two-thirds of the way along the axe (around 40mm from the blade edge). There is no median bevel or blade facet on the faces, although the blade narrows sharply to the edge. The faces are flat across their widths, gradually becoming increasing convex towards the blade edge. The sides of the axe are straight and divergent along the upper half of the axe and are concave along the blade, turning out sharply at the ends to produce blade tips (which give the blade a width of 67.0mm). The blade edge is strongly-curved. The surface of the axe has a mid-green surface with areas of dark-brown surface loss.\n\n\nThis find represents the twenty-second known copper flat axe from Wales and the second identified as of Ballybeg / Roseisle type.","fourFigureLat":"51.678787","fourFigureLon":"-2.681154","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2050","notes":"Metallurgical analysis  was attempted, with the axe was examined whole  within the specimen chamber. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from  under the surface corrosion were analysed and apart from very  superficial surface swabbing of the artefacts there was no sample  preparation. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken  from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by  the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as  curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also  affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or  depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt,  and preferential corrosion. \n\nThree separate readings were taken and  the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the  factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain  consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable  with other results the average compositions showed the axe to be  predominantly copper at 99.2 - 99.8%. Trace elements of arsenic, tin and  antimony were detected, with averages of 0.23%, 0.14% and 0.23%  respectively","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"July 29, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tintern","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.276.1i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"109.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
