The ring consists of a circular ring (internal diameter 6.5mm, external diameter 18.9mm, 6.9mm thick) with an integrally cast sub-rectangular slot (outside dimensions 10.5mm long x 5.1mm high x 3.6mm thick; internal dimensions 5.3mm long x 2.5mm high) projecting from one end, resulting in a maximum length of 22.1mm. A raised moulded&nbsp;central rib/seam runs along the outer circumference of the ring, giving the object a flattened hexagonal shape in plan. The object is a smooth mid to dark green patina with pocks of light green corrosion on both faces and weighs 8.54g.\n\nSimilar objects can be seen in the Late Bronze Age hoard of harness fittings found at Parc-y-Meirch, Denbighshire (Savory 1976: 52 fig.9). The similar objects in this hoard were situated within a larger outer ring, likely facilitating straps on a horse harness. These objects likely date to the transitional period between the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. \n\nSimilar objects are recorded on the PAS database e.g. CAM-6A8D1B, WAW-03C3E, &nbsp;HESH-7BCA6C, HESH-6A1A13.","fourFigureLat":"51.33840448","fourFigureLon":"-1.59943305","fromdate":"-1020","todate":"-800","notes":"Thanks to Cat Rees for her help with the record.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adelle Bricking","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wilton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20229331.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"22.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
