Flanking both faces of the axe is a wide, flat based channel that emanates from the tips of the blade.  Running the length of the axe, each channel gently expanding to the rear collar and gives the axe an overall hexagonal cross-section. Further decoration can be found on both sides where six transverse grooved lines are positioned before the collar. The Collar is undecorated and gently curves out at its base to form an expanded flanged terminal. \n\n\n\nOn the side of the axe is a loop that is made from a rectangular arched band that has two channels running its length.  These loops are normally positioned to run lengthways down the axe; however, this example has the loop positioned transversely across the axe. \n\n\n\nThe position of the loop in very uncommon, but this is one other example recorded on this database, see DOR-3F8141.","fourFigureLat":"51.66230565","fourFigureLon":"-2.33392242","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"\nThis item was recorded by images supplied by the finder \n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"May 31, 2020","datefound2":"December 01, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"34","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Uley","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Stroud","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO68DD0F3.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"125"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
