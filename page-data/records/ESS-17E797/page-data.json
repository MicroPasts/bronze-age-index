The axe is sub rectangular in plan and has a flared crescent shaped cutting blade edge. The sides are triangular in shape. The socket is sub-square in section.\n\n\n\nThe axe is 101.2mm in length. The blade is 44.4mm wide. The internal wall of the axe is approx 6.4mm thick. The external width of the socket is 40.7mm, whilst the internal width is 30.6mm. The width of the axe inclusing the loop is 40.6mm. The weight is 307.0g\n\n\n\nThe socket features a moulded bevelled collar which is immediately above a similar moulded band of lower relief. It is from this band that the top of the loop emerges. The loop has an external diameter of 22.7mm and in internal diameter of 10.6mm. It extends approx. 11.7mm from the side of the axe.\n\n\n\nBoth triangular shaped sides of the axe have the remains of a prominent casting seam still visible. The sub-rectangular faces of the axe are plan and undecorated. The axe widens towards the curving blade edge.\n\n\n\nThe axe is a dark green colour and the surface patina is relatively intact; being smooth with some abrasion, particular on the blade edge.\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic feature of this axe are prominent collar above a rib and plain decoration on the axe's body. This is characteristic of South-Eastern type socketed axeheads first defined by Butler (1963: 82-3). Oâ€™Connor (1980: 161) and Schmidt and Burgess (1981: 212, 216-7) date these to Ewart Park phase (950-800 cal BC following Roberts et al 2013)","fourFigureLat":"51.89575441","fourFigureLon":"0.55649143","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sophie Flynn","datefound1":"July 28, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sophie Flynn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Essex","district":"Braintree","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/slflynn/ESS17E797.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"101.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
