The axe is narrow with straight but tapering sides and there are no signs of a stop ridge. The butt is missing but would have been narrow. It has a very slightly flared convex cutting edge. The sides of the axe are very slightly thickened, but it does not have flanges. The surface, particularly the cutting edge, is pitted and corroded though the remaning surface has a smooth, deep green patina. The break at the butt end is equally patinated. The axe is 19.7mm wide at the break. The axe probably fits into the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC, or slightly later. The axe is 83mm long, 37.1mm wide and 6mm thick. 87.4g. The blade facets are about 7.5mm from the cutting edge to the flat face of the axe.
