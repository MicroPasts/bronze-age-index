The axehead is 91.6mm long and the socket is 42mm wide and 39mm thick externally. Both ends of the axehead are extensively chipped and damaged, and there are also chips on the body of the axehead. There is a circumferential ridge round the socket opening and beneath that three ribs run halfway down the body on the two main faces. There are casting spurs along the seams on the sides. The cutting blade widens slightly, but the damage prevents the extent of the flaring being known. There is a single loop on one side near the socket. The axehead has a deep turquoise and brown patina but with active corrosion at the damaged areas. The socketed axehead was a Late Bronze Age development. A very close parallel is number 39 on page 27 of \"Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in Merseyside County Museums\" by Susan Nicholson (1980).","fourFigureLat":"53.460206","fourFigureLon":"-1.640002","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"July 15, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"39","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bradfield","county":"Sheffield","district":"Sheffield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 292 axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"91.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
