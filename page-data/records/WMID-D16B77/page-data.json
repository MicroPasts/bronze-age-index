The axehead is complete but suffers from severe pitting from copper corrosion. The socket is sub-square in shape and measures approximately 24.4 mm by 24.4 mm. The body of the axehead is rectangular in plan, flaring at the blade. It is triangular in profile, tapering from 31.6 mm wide at the socketed end to 1.4 mm at the tip of the blade. A slight collar is visible just prior to the socket. One side has a semi-circular attachment loop and a casting flash is visible on this side also. The casting flash is more pronounced on the opposite side. The edges of the blade, originally crescent shaped, are now slightly damaged, and these areas have been polished smooth by a sharp striking action. The lack of the green patina on these areas indicates that this has occurred relatively recently, probably during ploughing. The axehead measures 95.8 mm long and weighs 204.4 grams.  It is 48.1 mm wide across the blade. It dates from between around 1000 to 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.678495","fourFigureLon":"-1.779575","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 25, 2011","datefound2":"March 28, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittington","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-D16B77.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"95.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
