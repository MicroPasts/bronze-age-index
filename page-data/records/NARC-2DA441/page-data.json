Thickness: 5.7 mm; Weight: 4.9 g.\n\n\n\n\nA tip fragment of a potential leaf-shaped spearhead; the fragmentary nature of the object makes it difficult to identify with certainty. The object has a central rounded midrib which extends to the blade tip and the sides curve widely, indicting the overall leaf-shaped nature of the spearhead. The cross-section is lozenge shaped. The object has a smooth surface and is covered with green patina.\n\n\n\n\nMax. Length: 31.4 mm, Max. Width: 26.6 mm, Max. Thickness: 5.3 mm; Weight: 10.6 g.\n\n\n\n\nA fragment of a copper alloy socketed axe. The fragment consists of the mouth and an unlooped side of a socketed axe. Due to the fragmentary nature of the axe, it is difficult to confidently assign a type; however based on the mounded collar, mouth and overall slender appearance, it is possibly of South-Eastern type (Needham 1990, 28). The casting seams are visible and it would appear that the axe has been horizontally squashed, creating a pinched appearance. The object has a smooth surface and is covered with green patina; there is soil debris attached to the interior.\n\n\n\n\nMax. Length: 52.6 mm, Max. Width: 31.4 mm, Max. Thickness: 23.1 mm; Weight: 40.2 g.\n\n\n\n\nA piece of copper alloy casting waste or casting jet. The piece is plano-convex and roughly triangular in shape with a conical protrusion. It is covered with green patina and mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion.\n\n\n\n\nMax. Length: 21.1 mm, Max. Width: 15.7 mm, Max. Thickness: 10.9 mm; Weight: 13.2 g.\n\n\n\n\nA piece of copper alloy casting waste. It is plano-convex and covered with green and brown patina and mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion.\n\n\n\n\nMax. Length: 19.5 mm, Max. Width: 20.5 mm, Max. Thickness: 4.1 mm; Weight: 5.0 g.\n\n\n\n\nA piece of copper alloy casting jet. The reservoir is wide and short with a flat top, leading to a rounded, conical feeder. It is covered with green patina and mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion.\n\n\n\n\nMax. Length: 24.0 mm, Max. Width: 27.9 mm, Max. Thickness: 22.0 mm; Weight: 31.3 g.\n\n\n\n\nA fragment of a copper alloy bun ingot. The fragment is plano-convex and covered with green and black patina and mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion.\n\n\n\n\nMax. Length: 34.4 mm, Max. Width: 28.5 mm, Max. Thickness: 18.7 mm; Weight: 31.0 g.\n\n\n\n\nA damaged copper alloy socketed axe. One face is almost entirely complete, with a large piece of the cutting-edge missing; the other face is also missing a section of the mouth. The axe is undecorated and overall quite slender. The mouth is wide with casting remains on the rim, flashes are visible on the interior; the external casting seems are present on either side, but do not extend below the loop. Due to the fragmentary nature of the axe, it is difficult to ascertain a specific type, however it is likely of South-Eastern, Class A type (Needham 1990, 28). This type dates to the Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park phase, c. 920-800 BC (Needham et al. 1997, 82). The axe is covered with a green patina and the interior contains soil debris, which affects the object's weight.\n\n\n\n\nMax. Length: 83.7 mm, Max. Width: 46.4 mm, Max. Thickness: 26.6 mm; Weight: 133.3 g.\n\n\n\nThe nature of this group of objects (ingot pieces and fragmentary objects) implies that they were deposited together and are related to the metalworking process, as they are typical of material which would be melted down and recycled.\n\n\n\nThe two socketed axe fragments are both likely to belong to the South-Eastern Type, Class A (Needham 1990, 28) and these objects can therefore be used to date the to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 920-800 BC). Parallel fragmentary examples have been found across Southern England, for example, as part of the Petters metalwork hoard (Needham 1990).\n\n\n\nAs the fragments (Nos. 1-21) are of Late Bronze Age date and appear to represent a single deposit of two or more copper alloy finds of prehistoric date, they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).\n\n\n\nDavis, R. 2012.
