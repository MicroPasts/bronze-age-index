The pair of ovoids are&nbsp;connected with&nbsp;a narrowed bar creating a deep recess between them.&nbsp; The upper edges of the bar are&nbsp;arched with a sub rectangular hollow between the projecting tips&nbsp;suggesting the object fitted on to another object. The outer surfaces of the ovoid elements&nbsp;are smooth with three areas of worn and feint decoration visible in the form of 3 or 4 parallel, vertical,&nbsp;short grooves incised in the middle of the ovoids on either side of the arched edge of the bar. The object has a dark grey patina and the weight suggests this is probably a&nbsp;leaded copper-alloy.\n\nMeasurements: height: 20.30mm; width: 20.62mm; thickness: 11.39mm and weight: 13.85g.&nbsp;\n\nA number of these so called &#39;moustache&#39; shaped objects of have now been recorded, with distinct variants identifiable. e.g. SUR-C942E4; KENT-4C615E;&nbsp;NMS-949F71&nbsp;and BH-BD3AFC. They are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although recess in the body of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were decorative&nbsp;mounted terminals, possibly associated with&nbsp;a dagger handle or on the end of a scabbard; however the absence of evidence makes this entirely conjectural.\n\nOne example was found in the Salisbury Hoard&nbsp;which contained Bronze Age material but was buried in the Iron Age (Stead, 1998, no.117).&nbsp;Another example was found in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35).&nbsp;","fourFigureLat":"51.21779408","fourFigureLon":"-0.98479937","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"20.3","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.39","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upton Grey","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS776773.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
