From this point the awl tapers to a rounded point at one end and tapers to a flattened point at the other. The flattened point was likely the tang and would have been inserted into a handle of wood, antler, or bone.\n\nThe awl has an uneven light green patina and small surviving fragments of dark patinated original surface and a pitting with lighter green corrosion.\n\nThis artefact type is well represented on the PAS database: c.f.
