The spearhead is complete and is 149.4mm long and weighs 101.3g. The circular socket has an external diameter at the mouth of 19.2mm. Adhering to the inside of the socket is a ring of surviving wood from the spear shaft, (the spear was deposited or lost in a wetland esturine environment). The sides of the socket converge towards the blade. Midway between the blade and the end of the socket are attachment loops (external dimensions 16 x 6mm) with irregular oval tops. The spearhead has a leaf shaped blade (maximum width 30.8mm) with straight converging blade edges. The socket continues as a solid rounded midrib as far as the tip. Bevelled blade edges are evident although eroded. The spearhead had a dark green to brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.662279","fourFigureLon":"-4.083392","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.301) and classed within his Type 6B Developed side-looped (Flame, flat blade, lozenge plates). Davis (2012, 76f.) lists 83 of this type of spearhead from Britain, with a concentration around the Thames Valley and a spread across Central England and Wales.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and elsewhere, and is similar to Savory (1980) No. 337:2. A similar side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has recently been dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating. However, overall Davis (2012, 108-110) places this group within the Taunton-Penard metalworking phases.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by a museum - not a Treasure case","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"19.2","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Llwchwr","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN3025.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"149.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
