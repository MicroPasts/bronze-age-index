The apeture is sub rectangular where it can be seen. The blade of the axe has a very slight curve at both sides, and is 39.79mm wide,  and 27.42mm wide above the socket. The aperture measures 18.98 by 23.81mm. On both the front and reverse of the axe is a single rib. The body is slightly facetted towards the edges and both sides are sub triangular in shape: the apex of the triangle is at the point of the blade. As well as the structural damage to the axe there is some minor damage, wear and corrosion whether due to age more recent damage cannot be determined. Much of the original surface is missing.\n\n\n\nLength 66.45mm, width 37.17mm, weight 113.2g\n\n\n\nBased on comparison with a similar axe in Schmidt & Burgess (1981, pl. 89, no. 1369) the axae discusssed above is of the Yorkshire type, and dates to the Late Bronze Age (c.900-800BC). Yorkshire  Type axes have a wide distribution through East Anglia and northwards into central Sotland (Ibid, p223). The type was well represented in both the Bowes Moor hoards (DUR-308251 and DUR-1F5057).\n\n\n\n\n\nRefs: Schmidt, P.K., Burgess, C., 1981. The Axes of Scotland and Northern England.
