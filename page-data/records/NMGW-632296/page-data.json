The butt is straight (23mm wide) and is angled slightly towards the unlooped side. The septum is thick, as is typical for the type, with a thickness at the butt of 6mm and 14mm at the base of the stop. The septum is slightly concave across its width. The flanges are concave and end well before the butt (18mm). The sides before the stop are straight. The stop is rounded, suggesting the type to be 'Guilsfield' and projects prominently above the blade surface. The top of the stop overhangs the septum with a height of 18-19mm. At the stop, the palstave blade has a width of 28.4mm (42.4mm including the loop) and has a thickness of 31.1mm. The sides of the blade are concave and diverge to a narrow and gently curving blade of 45.6mm width. Both sides exhibit the casting seams, which have been finished, probably initially through hammering and then filing, the seam on the unlooped side appears less well finished than the corresponding seam. The sides are comparatively straight across their thickness. The loop has an external width of 26.3mm (13.1mm internal), a maximum thickness of 9.1mm and projects 14mm above the side of the palstave. The exterior of the loop carries small faceting, possibly as a result of multi-directional filing. The blade has a comparatively deep convex curve near the stop, which becomes weaker as it approaches the edge, the blade is otherwise undecorated. Both blades display neat and systematic hammer-marks. The blade edge has been lost but prominent sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces. The palstave has good surface preservation with a mid to dark green patina. Small areas of surface damage and possible bronze disease are visible on the edges and a small recent scrape is visible on one flange, possibly as a result of excavation.","fourFigureLat":"53.257235","fourFigureLon":"-3.875258","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-950","notes":"This palstave is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975. The hoard consists of another similar palstave (NMGW-759FC0), a socketed axe (NMGW-75C4F7), a socketed gouge (NMGW-75FE70) and a blade of an uncertain object (NMGW-7621D3).\n\n\n\nBoth palstaves in this assemblage (this one and NMGWPA 2005.93.2) share many features and are similar in size and weight. Differences in the recurved blade may be a result of eroded blade tips on NMGWPA 2005.93.1, which is generally slightly less well preserved. It appears likely that both palstaves were produced at the same time and possibly from the same mould pairs. Within Wales, as the type may suggest, the palstaves can be best paralleled with the palstaves recovered amongst the hoard found at Guilsfield, Powys. One palstave in particular shares the same flange profile and drop from the stop onto the blade (Savory 1966, Fig.1 (14)). \n\n\n\nThis hoard can be fairly confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, resolution within this time period however, is problematic and requires metallurgical analysis to resolve. The palstaves (NMGWPA 2005.93.1-2) are suggested as being of 'Guilsfield' type and suggest manufacture during the Wilburton metalworking industry. Wilburton metalworking corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6 and is dated to c. 1150-950 BC. The socketed axe (NMGWPA 2005.93.3) of Type Gillespie can be dated from late Wilburton to Ewart Park (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pp 193), although Wilburton associations are known (ibid.). Savory (1980, pp 55)1 has suggested that a simple mouth moulding on socketed gouges suggests a later date within the type, probably implying a Ewart Park date for the gouge NMGWPA 2005.93.4, within Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950-750BC, though socketed gouges are known from the Wilburton phase.\n\n\n\nThe highly tentative parallel drawn between the blade fragment NMGWPA 2005.93.5 and the Acton Park hoard may present a slight possibility of an earlier association dating to the later Middle Bronze Age and of Acton 2 metalworking stage, corresponding to Needham's (ibid.) Period 5 and dated to c. 1500-1150BC. However, the blade may also plausibly represent the lower part of a tanged chisel, such as those seen in the Late Bronze Age hoards from Penwyllt, Powys, and Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No.284(9); No.288(3)). It is the Identifier's opinion that these complex dating issues may only be resolved through metallurgical analysis to identify the alloying group as outlined by Northover (1980).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Conwy","county":"Conwy","district":"Conwy","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.93.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"147.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
