The axe has broken in antiquity, at a position just above the base of the socket (with a surviving depth of 6mm, where the axe has a thickness of 9.9mm, the faces have a thickness of 2.8mm and the side if 5.5mm thick). A small length of the side survives, which is flat across its thickness with a raised but hammer-finished casting seam running down the centre. The blade tip is prominent and out-turned. The blade edge has a moderate curve for its surviving length. The blade edge has impact damage (5mm long), probably contemporary with is use or breakage, adjacent to the break. The short surviving blade lengths gradually converge towards the edge. The surface has a black-green patina with areas of green corrosion. Sharpening striations beneath the patina are evident of both blade faces. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes precise typological identification indeterminate. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. Axes of Ewart Park tradition are more commonly recovered. It is possible although not certain that the breakages on the axe may have been deliberate.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penton Mewsey","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20162041.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"20"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
