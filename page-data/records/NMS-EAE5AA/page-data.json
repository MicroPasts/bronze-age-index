AD 1500 - 1150.\n\n\n\nHeavily abraded and broken into two pieces, the larger is triangular with a broadly leaf or flame-shaped blade and a tapering central socketed mid-rib. The tip of the blade and the sides are heavily abraded, however, traces of the bevelled cutting edge remain. It exhibits a jagged break across the top of the socket. Conjoined at the base of the blade are two irregular off set oval shaped loops. The smaller fragment re-joins across the line of one of the loops. The break points, though re-joining are heavily abraded.\n\n\n\nSimilar to HESH-739CE4, the record for which states:\n\n\n\n\"Similar basal-looped spearheads have been classified by Richard Davis (2006) and dated to the Middle Bronze Age. Davis has sub-classified these into classes / Types. Due to the nature of this fragment it is difficult to define as this is based solely on blade shape. The findspot of this spearhead fits outside (although near the very edge) of Davis' Severn Estuary distribution pattern (33-34). He dates these by association and limited radiocarbon dates to the final phases of Acton Park (2), and Taunton (Cemmaes) metalworking traditions (pp 49-50). These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC) and make them contemporary with the more common side (string looped) spearheads Ehrenburg's Class IV.\"\n\n\n\nLength of main fragment: 100.5mm, maximum width: 43.5mm, minimum width: 3.4mm, surviving diameter of socket: 18.2mm, internal diameter:15mm, weight: 76.1g.\n\n\n\nLength of secondary fragment: 34mm, width: 15mm, thickness: 11.55mm, weight: 6.6g.","fourFigureLat":"52.73446776","fourFigureLon":"1.19789616","fromdate":"1500","todate":"1150","notes":"Field ref: CAW17","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"August 18, 2017","datefound2":"October 31, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Haveringland","county":"Norfolk","district":"Broadland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/25308_EAE5AA_LBA_Spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"110.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
