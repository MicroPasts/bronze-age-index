A transverse break at the butt end of the flanges means that the butt is missing but can be assumed to have been relatively narrow- the width at the break is 23.1mm, tapering slightly from the maximum width at the flanges of 28.1mm (not including the side loop). The sides are slightly convex as far as the high point of the stop and are then straight and slightly faceted before flaring out to the expanded blade. The roughly ovoid/flame shaped flanges are relatively high, being 32.6mm at their point of maximum breadth, reaching this point above the stops. The flanges can be assumed to have been slightly higher originally, as the edges show damage. The septum is c. 5.2mm thick and somewhat concave, ending in rounded stops. The broken loop is very slight, being a maximum of only 5.3mm thick and 18.2mm long. It extends from just above to just below the stops. The blade projects seamlessly from the flanges, with the sides smoothly narrowing down from the above the stops before. The length from the stops to the middle of the blade edge is 85.7mm. The blade is decorated with a single broad, poorly defined midrib on each face which extends from the stops to the top of the blade facet. The expanded blade has an incomplete width of 57.8mm, with one of the blade tips, and some of the edge missing. The blade has a maximum thickness below the stop of 27mm and thins to 11.1mm at the blade facet. The maximum length of the blade facet is c. 14mm. Some possible sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge are visible, although the corrosion and abrasion damage on this part of the palstave can make it difficult to be certain.  File marks, presumably from removing casting flashing, are visible on both sides of the blade.  A single casting flaw is visible on one face of the septum, consisting of a cavity that extends through the stop wall and into the body of the palstave.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is in relatively good condition, with the majority of the original metal surface remaining, which bears a dark green, brown and black patina. There is corrosion pitting and grazes over much of the surface, some of which expose the metallic core.","fourFigureLat":"51.43791016","fourFigureLon":"-1.85752363","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"George Whatley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"32.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Avebury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2021331.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"130.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
