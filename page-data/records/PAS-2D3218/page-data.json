Both sides of the ornament are folded over to create an overall [ shape (similar to other objects of this date and style, cf. the Binstead 'rings', discussed below). The object has been distorted and crumpled. It is not clear whether the damage occurred before or after deposition, but the latter is probable given the lack of clear or intentional breakage.\n\n\n\nDimensions:\n\n\n\nIn its current state the object has dimensions of 30mm by 23mm (length by breadth). Measure with a soft tape the object would have had a length of 70mm and a width of c.14-15mm.\n\n\n\nWeight: 4.84g\n\n\n\nComposition of the gold:\n\n\n\nThe composition of the gold was tested using non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis. It indicated a surface composition of approximately 88-90% gold and 9-11% silver, the rest being copper.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe function of this band is uncertain. It could be a ring or an ornament with another function. It share features in common with goldwork of probable Middle Bronze Age date, including the substantially larger Capel Isaf (Dyfed, Wales) armlets (Savory 1977), two small interlocked gold 'rings' found at Binstead (West Sussex) (Varndell 1998-9, 10-11, fig. 3) and the Woolaston (Gloucestershire) goldwork hoard (Treasure case 2013 T805, now in the British Museum).\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nSavory, H. 1977, 'A New Hoard of Bronze Age Gold Ornaments', Archaeologia Atlantica, 1977 (Vol. 2).\n\nVarndell 1998-9, 'Binstead, West Sussex: Two Bronze Age gold rings linked together', Treasure Annual Report 1998-1999, DCMS, 10-11\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\nNeil Wilkin\n\nCurator, The British Museum","fourFigureLat":"51.88483259","fourFigureLon":"-2.80049878","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"As a find of a precious metal object of Bronze Age date, this object qualifies as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).\n\n\n\nReported via Mark Lodwick at National Museum Wales.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Neil Wilkin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Ian Richardson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Garway","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2018T304a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":"30"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
