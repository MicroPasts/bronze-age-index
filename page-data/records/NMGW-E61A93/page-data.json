Three convergent longitudinal ribs extend from mouth moulding on each face.  Exterior mouth shape is oval, whilst the interior is rectangular.  Four runner bases project 1.5-2.5mm above the mouth top.  The body of the axe is slightly hexagonal in shape with angular side edges.  Base of socket is evenly shaped.  Sides of axe are slightly divergent but straight, with no recurving at the blade edges.  The casting flashes remain prominent, but may have been coarsely trimmed, although excess within the loop-hole has not been trimmed.  The blade edge is nearly flat in side profile, with no striations on the blade bevel visible.  Slight nicks in the blade edge are probably the result of corrosion.  Black encrustation visible on the blade end surfaces.  Rest of the axe has green patination overlying a greyish surface with occasional carbonate encrustations.","fourFigureLat":"51.47427","fourFigureLon":"-3.426831","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"68","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"105.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
