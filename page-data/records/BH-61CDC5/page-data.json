The razor has a trapezoidal shaped blade, which is sub-triangular in cross section.  The lower portion of the blade is decorated with three grooves separated by two moulded ridges.  A transverse moulded line, which is triangular in cross-section, runs across the top of the blade and links the two integral loops. \n\n\n\nThe razor has a mid-brown patina and has significant pitting over both faces.  The cutting edge is worn, with some small breakages in parts. \n\n\n\nBroadly similar examples can be found in the British Museum's Online Catalogue: 1998,0901.287 (blade shape), 1963,1208.1 (moulded line at top and blade shape).  Comparable groves can be seen on NMS-F0B277 on he Portable Antiquities Scheme database.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: length at base: 79.9mm; length at top: 44.6mm; height (including loop): 40.2mm; height (excluding loop): 29.8mm; thickness at base: 0.8mm; thickness of top: 3.1mm;  thickness of loop: 3.4mm; external diameter of loop: 10.8mm.
