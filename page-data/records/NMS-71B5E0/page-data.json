The handle socket is entirely missing from an old brittle-break at the point where it would have originally joined the blade. The pronounced midrib continues for the full length of the blade with an internally round socket extending just over halfway towards the tip. Externally the midrib contours smoothly to form the wings of the spearhead blade, the profile of which has a sub-lozengiform shape, reaching a maximum width at the approximate halfway point. The profile of the blade wings from the socket to the widest point has a slight curve suggesting more of a leaf-shape profile, but the forward profile to the tip is much more of a linear taper with one flange stepping-in slightly suggesting material loss at this point, either through post deposition damage or perhaps more likely in-use modification such as sharpening. There is no extant evidence of edge bevelling around any of the blade periphery. Unfortunately due to the missing socket it is not possible to determine the means of attachment to the shaft, either with Middle Bronze Age loops, or pegs associated with the later Bronze Age. Assessment of all of the features suggests a date from the later part of the Middle Bronze Age through into the later period, albeit an accurate Davis group typology cannot be assigned; circa 1200-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.64919164","fourFigureLon":"0.64458631","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"April 01, 2019","datefound2":"April 01, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Swaffham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/63362_71B5E0_BA_Spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"85.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
