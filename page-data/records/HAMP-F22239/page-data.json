It measures 113.90mm in length, 27.82mm in max.width (across the base of the blade), 23.13mm in max.thickness and diameter (at the open end of the socket) and with a socket depth at least 87mm. The internal socket diameter is 18.24mm. Weighs 66.82g.\n\nThe spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade, measuring 14.79mm in thickness at its widest point (27.82mm) and extending from just above the two peg-holes (one of which is 4.9mm in diameter, the other 3.9mm). The blade has a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib (extending from a conical socket). It is unclear how far beyond the depth of at least 87mm the socket extends as traces of wood are apparent in the socket. The line of the blade is smoothly curving and angles a little more sharply at the tip. Peter Reavill (FLO, Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments that this example is on the cusp of being 'stumpy', which Ehrenburg defines as being less than 100mm in length and having a width 1/3 their length (pers.comm. May 2014).\n\nMuch of the original patina has been lost and one surface in particular is a shiny coppery colour, an indication of deposition in water or peat that is anaerobic.","fourFigureLat":"51.4860175","fourFigureLon":"-0.12909005","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"March 01, 2014","datefound2":"April 15, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"23.13","edge":null,"thickness":"23.13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Vincent Square","county":"Greater London Authority","district":"City of Westminster","regionName":"London","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-F22239.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"113.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
