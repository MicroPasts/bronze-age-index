Insubstantial loop extends from the middle of the onset collar.  The mouth has an oval internal and external shape and the axe is oval in cross section.  Excess metal protrudes around the internal circumference of the mouth top.  The socket narrows to a point.  The sides of the axe are concave and diverge to form a splaying blade edge, whilst the casting flashes have only been coarsely trimmed.  Excess metal within the loop has not been removed.  The blade edge has been extensively damaged  through corrosion, although striations parallel to it on the blade bevel indicate that the blade was at least partially prepared for use.  A slight imperfection in the original mould is visible as a slight linear ridge running down the face of the collar and below onto the upper face.  Green patination with green carbonate encrustation.","fourFigureLat":"51.47427","fourFigureLon":"-3.426831","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"62","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"107"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
