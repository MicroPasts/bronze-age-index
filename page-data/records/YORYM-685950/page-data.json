The spear tip fragment is 33.98mm in length with a width of 14.89mm and a maximum thickness of 7.35mm. The weight of the spear tip is 8.54g. The fragment is lancet shaped and tapers to a point. It has a profile of a circle with a narrow blade protruding centrally from either side, resulting in a ridge running up the centre of the spear head. The edges of the spear tip have sustained damaged and are highly worn and dented. Corrosion of the copper-alloy has resulted in a smooth dark green patina. Not enough of the spearhead has remained to be able to date this fragment to a more precise range, although the circular section, the angle of the blade, and the midrib extending to the to the tip suggest comparisons with spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.\n\n\n\nSimiliar object on the database: WMID - 560F7F.","fourFigureLat":"54.08041299","fourFigureLon":"-0.48825758","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss.
