BC 1550-1150). The tip of the handle and most of the blade are missing. The portion of the blade remaining is rectangular in shape and lozenge in section, and has a central rib running longitudinally down the blade. The base of the blade widens into a ‘hipped’ expansion formed of two triangular shapes pointing outwards, after which the knife narrows again. The opposite end splits and is formed of two prongs which would have formed an attachment hole for a plug rivet when complete.  \n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-green patina and is worn. The knife is 50.6mm long, 23.6mm wide, 5mm thick and weighs 20.1g.
