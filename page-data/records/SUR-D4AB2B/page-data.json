The ring is solid, with an external diameter of 28.9mm and internal diameter of 15.4mm. The hoop is 7.3mm thick and 7mm wide although varying in thickness around the ring, which may be the result of differential wear. Possibly a harness component; however such simple objects found in isolation are very difficult to attribute to a specific function or date.","fourFigureLat":"51.04027448","fourFigureLon":"-1.30247912","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"28.9","edge":null,"thickness":"7.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Twyford","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURD4AB2B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
