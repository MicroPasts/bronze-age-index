The chisel is in good condition and appears undamaged, with evidence for use wear on the blade tip and edge. The chisel has a tapering square-sectioned tang which abuts the round-sectioned, collared handle stop of the chisel blade. The collar is 13.5 mm diameter. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in profile and expands to a thin cutting edge with slightly flared shoulders. The cutting edge is 27.5 mm wide. The object is in very good coniditon and has a mid-brown patina across much of its surface.\n\n\n\nTanged chisels, which date from c. 1150-850 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds; complete examples from such contexts are uncommon. Three other complete tanged chisels from Oxfordshire are of almost identical form; on this database an example from South Oxfordshire (see BERK-52E8C3), from Noke (BERK-D3E079) and another illustrated in Evans (1881:168 no. 193) from Wallingford (formerly Berkshire). Other examples from across the country include DUR-5BADA1 and NMS-769173.","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"13.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017085.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"85.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
