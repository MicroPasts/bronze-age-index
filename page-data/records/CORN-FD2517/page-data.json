The ends of the central ribs survive on both faces of the blade, below the broken end, but the blade above this is missing so there is no evidence of the median ribs dividing a shield shape below the stop-ridge. The blade is broad and only slightly expanded and because the stop-ridge, flanges and possible side-loop are missing, it is difficult to date this fragment. The raised central rib is wide and pronounced, but only continues down about a third of the blade, which suggests that this palstave was probably made during the Taunton phase, c.1400-1275 BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRohl & Needham (1998) illuatrate a similar examples of a palstave and a broken blade on page 129, Fig.30, Nos.145-6, which is dated to the Taunton phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar 'South West looped', median ribbed axes from Colyton in Devon on Plate 28, Nos.217b & 217c, and from Chard and Chilton Polden in Somerset on Plates 71-2, Nos.619 & 632a.","fourFigureLat":"50.262035","fourFigureLon":"-4.807434","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1275","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"January 31, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mevagissey","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June10finds 029.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
