The asymmetric casting with a misaligned core has caused one socket wall (11 mm thick) to be much thicker than the other (4 mm thick). This does not appear to have prevented the axehead from having been prepared and used. The socketed axe appears to have been deliberately broken in antiquity, most likely while hot from recent experimental research (Matt Knight pers comm). The blade has broken off below the socketed body of the axe where any decoration, probably in the form of longitudinal parallel ribs, would have terminated. There is a deep longitudinal groove on one face but this is more recent damage since deposition. The end of the socket is internally 28 mm long, 7 mm wide and 20 mm deep.\n\n\n\nSee CORN-37D710 for an axehead from the St Buryan hoard with a similar slightly expanded blade and three parallel ribs on each face with is part of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage, dating from c.950-850 BC.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example from St. Erth, that is in Penzance Museum, on page 565, plate 4, no.43a, which is classified as a Stogursey-type socketed axe, but is also referred to as a South Wales type, but without the complete axehead, it cannot be classified.","fourFigureLat":"50.37113783","fourFigureLon":"-4.34975321","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"October 27, 2017","datefound2":"November 05, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Deviock","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN5968.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"50"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
