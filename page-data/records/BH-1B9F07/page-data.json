The object is roughly oval in plan and D-shape in cross-section. The edges are uneven and heavily abraded or broken in several places. An incomplete irregular and worn broken oval-sectioned spur extends from the base that is likely the lower section of two arms. All of the surfaces are pitted and have light grey patination.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 28.2mm long, 19.2mm wide and is 17.5mm high. It weighs 20.45 grams.\n\n\n\nCasting waste is very hard to date in isolation, and piece like this could date from the Bronze Age to Roman period. The fact that this one comes to an oval broken edge may suggest that it was for casting a palstave or possibly a tool, and therefore most likely dates to the Middle Bronze Age. Such material is rare as it is was usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting. The few similar objects on the Portable Antiquities Scheme include LVPL-3AAD50 and HESH-B55DB1.","fourFigureLat":"51.72017047","fourFigureLon":"-0.85777765","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"450","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"August 31, 2019","datefound2":"November 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"17.5","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Princes Risborough","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Wycombe","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH1B9F07.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
