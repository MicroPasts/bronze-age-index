Also the axe has been over-cleaned therefore any detail such as hammer marks or even a possible flange are not visible. The blades' tip, and cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical , but whether this is due to wear or cleaning is uncertain. The blade tapers towards the butt of the axe. The butt is slightly curved. The surface of the axe is pitted and only has a small element of the patina remaining.","fourFigureLat":"52.876093","fourFigureLon":"-2.298602","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eccleshall","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"69.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
