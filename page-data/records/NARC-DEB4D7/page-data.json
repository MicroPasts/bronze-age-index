The side flanges are lozenge shaped, and rise to 23.3 mm at their highest. A ridged stop separates the blade from the septum at 53 mm from the end of the butt. The stop is 4.1 mm thick. The butt is slightly damaged, with a crescent shaped gap. Based on the patina, this occurred in antiquity and may have been a mistake in the casting of the axehead. The blade is wide and crescent shaped, measuring 73 mm wide. The axehead is 26.6 mm wide at the butt end and 134.1 mm in length. It weighs 400 grams. The cutting edge is still fairly sharp. The object has a dark brown to green patina, but is suffering from verdigre in places.  This example is undecorated and has neither shield nor rib decoration on the blade. The absence of an attachment loop also suggests it falls within the earlier part of the phase.","fourFigureLat":"52.660238","fourFigureLon":"-1.66139","fromdate":"1500","todate":"1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"September 12, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thorpe Constantine","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/Bronze Age axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"134.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
