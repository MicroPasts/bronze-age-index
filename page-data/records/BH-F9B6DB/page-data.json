The surviving axe consists of part of the broken body and blade, with missing loop and collar. The body of the axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge. The cast longitudinal moulding consisting of four parallel ribs extends partially along both the front and rear faces, terminating at what would approximately have been the mid-point of each face. The moulding is incomplete where the axe is broken, and very worn on one side. The sides of the axe are lentoidal in plan and the trimmed central longitudinal casting seams are clearly visible. The body of the axe narrows towards the expanded blade. The blade edge is rounded and damaged in several areas through abrasion and corrosion and is missing one tip. The inside of the axe is hollow and sub-rectangular in cross-section and contains small traces of depositional residual on the interior surfaces. As well as being unevenly broken at one end, the axe also has several areas of lamination and scratches on its outside surfaces, all of which are patinated, like all of the exterior surfaces, in a mid-green colour. The interior surfaces of the axe have a similar coloured patina with additional patches of brown.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 73.5mm in length, 39.6mm in width and 3.8mm thick at the blade, 29.2mm in width and 28.8mm thick at the broken socketed end, 3.9mm in maximum wall thickness, and weighs 147.30 grams.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is comparable to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-750 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.98681931","fourFigureLon":"0.03734835","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"September 30, 2018","datefound2":"November 05, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"29.9","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nuthampstead","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"North Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BHF9B6DBa.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"73.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
