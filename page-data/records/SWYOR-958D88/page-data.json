Only the cutting end survives. The butt is missing due to an ancient and well worn break across the middle of the axe. The break has taken half the surface of one face too. The axe head is rectangular in section. The cutting edge is flared at the sides but damaged. The surfaces of the axe are pitted and corroded, with a well developed green patina.","fourFigureLat":"53.997993","fourFigureLon":"-1.299779","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Carole Bloom","datefound1":"January 22, 2012","datefound2":"January 22, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carole Bloom","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Green Hammerton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1762_Axe_head.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"47.15"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
