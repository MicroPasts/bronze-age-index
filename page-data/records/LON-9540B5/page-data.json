This sword is a flange-hilted sword, the blade and hilt being cast as one with flanges running along the edges of the hilt. The terminus is fan shaped and about half the width of the shoulder. There is a small, uneven, deposit of lead at the terminus end which may have been to aid balance. There is a slight bulge in the hilt, towards the shoulder, and a rounded slot in the centre of the hilt (33.95 mm long by 6.20 mm wide).The shoulder curves outwards to its widest with a ricasso notch below where the blade joins the hilt, resulting in a barbed effect on the shoulder. One of the notches is heavily worn making it almost invisible. There are two oval rivet holes on either side of the shoulder (10.52 mm and 7.80 mm in diameter). The bevelled blade is leaf shaped, being particularly lenticular towards the tip.\n\n\n\nThere is considerable green-blue oxidation product on one side of the blade, the side which was facing down when discovered. Amongst this oxidisation are 3-4 patches of reddish-brown oxidisation. The other side has some green-blue product but also a light brown patination across much of the surface. One would assume that the most heavily oxidised side had been in contact with water for a long period of time, therefore being found facing downwards may suggest it had been flipped whilst in the river. There are \"nicks\" along the blade edge probably caused by a similar weapon, which may be evidence of use either in battle or practice.\n\n\n\nThis type of sword has primarily been found in the Thames Valley area or the Fens (Jon Cotton, pers. comm.). Examples of fragments can be found on the PAS database: NMGW-7D0AC5, HAMP-352B13 and LVPL759\n\n\n\nDimensions: Total length: 538 mm; length of blade: 423 mm; width of blade: 38.31 mm; length of hilt: 98.29 mm; width of shoulder: 55.93 mm; width of terminus: 26.94 mm; thickness of blade: 7.20 mm; weight: 496g.\n\n\n\nReferences: Burgess, C.
