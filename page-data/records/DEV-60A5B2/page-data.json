The item is broadly triangular shaped in plan and oval in section. It is hollow at the centre, and appears to have been socketed. The tip tapers to a rounded, blunt point. One face appears to be very slightly convex, whilst the other face is flatter. The item is very abraided; the patina is a mid green colour and there are lighter green powdery patches of corrosion on the surface. The item is 20mm in length and 18mm in width at the wider end; it tapers to 7mm at the rounded end and is 5mm in thickness.","fourFigureLat":"50.51023794","fourFigureLon":"-3.56680746","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Danielle Wootton","datefound1":"June 05, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Danielle Wootton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coffinswell","county":"Devon","district":"Teignbridge","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwootton/Copperalloyitem.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Danielle Wootton","length":"20"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
