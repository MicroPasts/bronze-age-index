The blade edge is abraded, slightly blunt where complete and has notches. Both faces of the blade are decorated with a single rib. The sides of the blade are triangular with a casting seam which has been smoothed, but still forms a slight ridge. There is no loop on the palstave.\n\n\n\nThe sides of the septum have a more prominent cast seam ridge, and the sides taper towards the butt of the palstave. There is a deep stop on both faces of the septum with a flange running down the sides on each face. The flanges on the side view taper in depth towards the butt. One face at the butt has a deeper possible air hole. The butt is abraded.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has an incomplete well-developed mottled dark grey patina which is pitted. Where there is a more recent scrape the metal is a shiny grey colour.\n\n\n\nThe palstave measures 153.44mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 57.46mm wide from blade tip to blade tip, and 27.87mm thick across the stops. It weighs 362g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is similar to Figure 21, No. 154 in Savoury (1980). The palstave is an early/primary Group II example which dates to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to c. 1500-1300 BC.\n\n\n\nSavory, H.N. 1980 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections National Museum of Wales: Cardiff","fourFigureLat":"51.81503024","fourFigureLon":"-1.62423691","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"May 18, 2019","datefound2":"May 18, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.87","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fulbrook","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWFCE34D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"153.44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
