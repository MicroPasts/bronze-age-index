Only the lower half survives, with a worn and irregular transverse break across the socket.  The body of the axe narrows just below the break. There are blade tip hollows and the blade is expanded. Most of the blade edge and both tips are missing, and the edge and surface around the blade is heavily corrosion chipped. The casting flash has mostly been removed. There are many fine transverse lines across one face of the axe only.  Mixed light to brown-green patina.  Forms part of a hoard of Late Bronze Age metalwork, probably deposited circa 1000 to 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.226893","fourFigureLon":"0.705451","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Lenham Station Hoard no.2","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Richardson","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Richardson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22.42","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lenham","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/arichardson/KENT-8D44F3a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"76.04"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
