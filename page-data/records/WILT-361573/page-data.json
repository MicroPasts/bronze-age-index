It measures 36.24x9.87x9.84mm and weighs 10.74g. \n\nThe object resembles half a moustache and consists of one solid pointed drop-shape. It is uncertain if it was originally a single half (as these are known) or one half of an original whole which would have been joined to the second half by a (probably perforated) central area.\n\nAt the wider end (9.87x9.84mm) the jagged (old) break stands 3.6mm proud of the solid object, suggesting the end would have been hollow, perhaps for attachment purposes. This half of the 'half moustache' is decorated with longitudinal pronounced ridges and deep grooves (twenty ridges) which encircle the outside edge whilst the object itself narrows and thins to 7.33x9.18mm. On the underside three ridges there are obscured slightly by a smoother patch of copper alloy, apparently over the top of the ridges. \n\nBeyond this the object tapers more dramatically to an (old) break 4.07x4.64mm. This half is plain, if badly pitted through loss of patina.\n\nThese moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). Three other examples are known besides the twelve recorded on the PAS database. Some of these are single examples, while others are 'double' sometimes with a central perforation. This suggests the object was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small. Dr JD Hill feels these objects date to the Iron Age rather than the Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.06916283","fourFigureLon":"-1.80156857","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-300","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"August 29, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.84","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Salisbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Leake0909moustache.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"36.24"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
