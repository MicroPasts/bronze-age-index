The shank tapers and changes from oval to circular sectioned with a marked bend near the point. The slightly bent lozenge-sectioned looped head has two granular and possibly recent breaks where around a third of the loop is missing. The surface has some wear and corrosion but appears to be undecorated. Weight 22.09g. Extant length 208mm. Width of head loop: 77mm. c.1400-1250 BC.\n\n\n\nQuoit-headed pins are characteristic of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' which has been dated to the Taunton and Penard metalwork phases (Roberts 2007, 139-41). Quoit-headed pins are relatively rare, with c. 80 known examples. The bent tip is a common feature on the larger pins suggesting it was deliberate and probably functional. The form and size of pins varies considerably, with examples of all types found mainly in East Anglia, the south coast and south-west.","fourFigureLat":"52.66106548","fourFigureLon":"0.51220395","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Steven Ashley","datefound1":"March 12, 2019","datefound2":"April 07, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Steven Ashley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Marham","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/58496_3D6677_MBA_Pin.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"208"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
