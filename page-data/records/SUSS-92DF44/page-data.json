The butt end terminates in a straight edge measuring: 21.71mm wide and 5.93mm thick. The&nbsp;septum is rectangular&nbsp;and measures 66.93mm long from the stop to the butt.&nbsp;The flanges extend in a straight line rising from approximately 30mm from the butt&nbsp;and&nbsp;extending to meet the projecting stop-ridge. Adjacent to the stop is a single low attachment loop, with a D-shaped aperture, the loop measuring&nbsp;26.0&nbsp;mm&nbsp;long; 9.28mm wide and 6.75mm thick. There are no casting seams.\n\nThe blade is flat slender and&nbsp;and curves up steeply at the stop to meet the projecting&nbsp;stop-ridge; below which extend three worn parallel ribs on both sides of the blade measuring approximately 17mm in length. The flange sides of the axehead above the stop are straight and taper to the narrower butt. Below the stop ridge the sides of the blade narrow&nbsp;slightly in width&nbsp;and become slightly concave, flaring out gently&nbsp;to the cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged along its length with the original profile lost.&nbsp;\n\nMeasurements: length: 150.46mm; width at stop-ridge excluding loop: 25.17mm; width at stop-ridge including loop: 36.98mm; thickness at stop-ridge: 31.91mm and weight: 353g.\n\nThis palstave was discovered in the vicinity of&nbsp;a Middle Bronze Age hoard&nbsp;SUSS-A2AE5D (2022T305); a couple of weeks after the excavation of the hoard. The notable difference in condition of this example and the later date suggest this was not&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;hoard.&nbsp;","fourFigureLat":"50.9315933","fourFigureLon":"-0.33643094","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.91","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ashurst","county":"West Sussex","district":"Horsham","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS92DF44.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"150.46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
