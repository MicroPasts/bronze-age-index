The spearhead is badly damaged, missing its tip and much of its shaft. A crack runs down one side of what remains of the spearhead. The socket is oval in shape, but is bent due to the damage. The socket measures 12.45 mm long and 15.23 mm wide at the broken attachment end and approximately 10.7 mm in diameter at the broken tip end. Either side of the socket is a chamfered wing, emerging just after the break at the shaft end. The spearhead measures 41.55 mm long and is 27.41 mm at its widest point. It is 13.05 mm thick and weighs 18.0 grams. The surface has a dark green to black patina, heavily pitted in places. As the artefact is only a fragment it is difficult to discern whether there would orginally have been attachment loops further down the shaft, and so identification of a precise type is problematic.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"January 01, 2010","datefound2":"January 31, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Abbots Bromley","county":"Staffordshire","district":"East Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-1B62F5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"41.55"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
