The axe head is trapezoidal in shape with a curved broad butt and blade. There is no significant flare to the blade end. The axe had a lenticular cross-section and has signs of wear to both the blade and butt ends. The butt end is 17.7 x 2.6 mm, that widens to 33.58 x 3.37 at the blade. The axe head appears to be of a broad butt type, probably a 'Migdale' type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44).\n\n\n\nOne surface has a smooth dark green patina with some erosion to the edge, the other side is heavily pitted with a mottled mid-green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.55354532","fourFigureLon":"-1.43889257","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"September 07, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Letcombe Regis","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BERKAD8EB5.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"78"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
