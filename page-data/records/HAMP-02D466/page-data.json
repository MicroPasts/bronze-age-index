It is sub-rectangular in shape with a roughly rounded butt end.  It expands from c. 1.9mm at the butt to 9.3mm at the break: the edge is triangular. In cross-section the object is sub-rectangular.  There are side flanges on both upper and lower faces, either side of the septum (the area between the flanges and the stop ridge).  The whole has corroded to a coarse surface mainly mid-green in colour but with large areas of a black coating, particularly on one face.","fourFigureLat":"51.068146","fourFigureLon":"-1.473323","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"October 23, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ashley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-02D466palstavefrag.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"29.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
