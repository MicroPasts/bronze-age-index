The exterior face has a raised rounded border on its three original sides, surrounding nine longitudinal ribs separated by ten rounded concave grooves to give an evenly corrugated effect. Some of the grooves have longitudinal scratches which may be from the mould or from later finishing. The interior face is flat apart from a slight ridge at the original short edge, which may be a result of gentle hammering or, more probably, a reflection of the original mould former. The break appears to be fresh.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1001","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Colin Pendleton","datefound1":"January 01, 1995","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fminter/SPLsf785sf3482slide1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Suffolk County Council Archaeology Service","length":"19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
