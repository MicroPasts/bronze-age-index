Central hollow in base, transverse median groove around the top and a perforation in the centre of the upper face. There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both sides of the moustache (the upper face on one side partly worn) and plain constrictions at points. Height 20mm. Width 30mm. Thickness 13mm. Weight 13.89g. The date of this enigmatic object is uncertain. Examples occurred in the Salisbury Hoard, which contained Bronze Age material but was buried in the Iron Age (Stead 1998). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (see entry for HAMP-C04CC3).
