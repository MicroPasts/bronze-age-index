Possibly of Arreton type dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 BC.\n\n\n\nDescription: The axehead survives in two heavily corroded pieces. the blade end has snapped just about 3 cms past the shallow proto stop ridge. It has flanged parallel sides which run from the edge of the blade along the body towards the butt. The flanges appears to be cast rather than hammered out. The blade itself is a wide crescent shape with slightly upturned corners. The flanges narrow slightly towards the centre of the body and widen back towards the edge they are also shallower at each end. The axehead's surface is heavily patinated and pitted with some abrasion along the edges. The break are heavily abraded and likely having occured while in the ground. The corrosion is very advanced\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 172mm long, 69mm wide, 31mm thick (at thickest) and 500g in weight\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The axehead superficially seems to fit with the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (Burgess and Schmidt, 1981. 65 - 75). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c. 1750 - 1600 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.29808037","fourFigureLon":"0.32229736","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wrotham","county":"Kent","district":"Tonbridge and Malling","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT17EAABa.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"172"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
