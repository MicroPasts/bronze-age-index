The awl has an almost flat sub-rectangular cross section at the tang end, which  widens to become more rounded in the centre of the awl. The awl then  tapers to a point. There is some debate as to the date of such  awls, which probably first  appeared in the Late Bronze Age but could  conceivably have continued to  have been made until much later; here the  patina does suggests a prehistoric date.","fourFigureLat":"51.625541","fourFigureLon":"-1.452451","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"September 10, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Michael Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.56","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Hanney","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/maritime/607.
