The chisel is represented by the blade, collar, and the beginning of the tang and has a surviving length of 44.7mm. The tang has broken just above the collar, which survives as a low transverse ridge on each face and is more projecting on the sides. The collar has a surviving width of 8.7mm, but is very worn. The thickness at this point is 6.2mm. The blade is crinoline in plan with a gently curved cutting edge of 16.6mm width. Much of the original surface has been lost and the chisel is eroded.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-700","notes":"Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).\n\n\n\nThe crinoline shape of the blade is quite unusual and reminiscent of some Middle Bronze Age palstave forms, though is less well-known from later contexts. Additionally, later collars are typically more prominent. This may suggest this is an earlier form of tanged and collared chisel.\n\n\n\nTanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt 'C' sword.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katrina Deering","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kdeering/DSCN2534.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"44.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
