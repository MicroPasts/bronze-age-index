It is lenticular in section, with a marked central rib giving it this profile. There are breaks at both terminals, and the sides of the blade are also jagged and damaged. The surface is largely a smooth dark brownish green, but areas of damage show the lighter green undersurface. \n\n\n\nNumerous similar fragments are recorded on the database, which include SF-F0C159 and NMGW-587A08. The size of the fragments makes close typological assessment difficult, but the width of this example suggests it is a wider blade belonging to the later Middle to Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 68.8mm length,  35.1mm width, 6.5mm thickness, weight 53.76g.","fourFigureLat":"50.93575848","fourFigureLon":"-3.33912276","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"January 01, 2020","datefound2":"October 13, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Burlescombe","county":"Devon","district":"Mid Devon","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV6B72E1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"68.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
