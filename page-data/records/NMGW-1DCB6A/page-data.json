At the break, the axe has a rectangular section with a comparatively slender blade (25.6mm wide and 10.8mm thick) and displays evidence that the axe was bent prior to breaking. The sides are convex across their widths and near-straight or gently convex across the surviving length and divergent before sharply out-turning to produce an expanded and well-curved blade edge. The blade tips and original blade edge have been damaged (giving a surviving blade width of 44.7mm). Beneath the break, both faces were decorated with crude linear incised lines. There is no suggestion of flanges on the surviving part of the blade. Both faces have a discernible blade facet, corresponding with the recurving of the blade (15mm from the blade edge). The surface is corroded with some deep pitting and a mid-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the axe makes typological identification difficult but the slender blade form and out-turned blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon or allied axe, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 65-48) . Schmidt & Burgess (ibid) note the lack of associations between Type Bandon and other axes and tentatively suggest that they may be of Stage V, Willerby metalworking, corresponding to the latter part of Needham's (1996) Period 3, (c. 2,050 - 1,700BC), perhaps suggesting a date of c. 1900 - 1700BC.\n\n\n\n1.
