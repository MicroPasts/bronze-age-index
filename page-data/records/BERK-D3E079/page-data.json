The chisel is in good copndition and appears undamaged, with evidence for use wear on the blade tip and edge. The chisel has a tapering square-sectioned tang, 6.66mm thick, which abutts the round-sectioned, collared handle stop of the chisel blade. The collar is 11.7mm diameter. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in profile and expands to a very thin cutting edge with slightly flared shoulders. The cutting edge is 33.2mm wide. The object is in very good coniditon and has a mid-brown patina across much of its surface.\n\n\n\nTanged chisels, which date from c. 1150-850 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds; complete examples from such contexts are uncommon. Several tanged chisels, or elements of them, are recorded on this database (for example, see BH-49EAD8). Two other complete tanged chisels from Oxfordshire are of almost identical form; on this database an example from South Oxfordshire (see BERK-52E8C3), and another illustrated in Evans (1881:168 no. 193) from Wallingford (formerly Berkshire). Similar examples have been recorded on this database from across the county, including DUR-5BADA1 and NMS-769173.","fourFigureLat":"51.81303213","fourFigureLon":"-1.21808761","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Noke","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2016170.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"93.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
