One side is of rectangular section, bent and incomplete; the intact side is of circular section, its diameter declining towards the point. The corroded surface retains patches of a dull green patination.\n\n\nDimensions: 58.6mm long, 5mm high, 4.7mm thick. Weight: 5.26g.\n\n\nThere is some debate as to the date of such awls, which probably first appeared in the Late Bronze Age but could conceivably have continued to have been made until much later. The patination of this piece does suggest a possible prehistoric date.","fourFigureLat":"52.019877","fourFigureLon":"0.199175","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Harvey Cross","datefound1":"April 05, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julian Watters","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ugley","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jwatters/Awl_12_104a_22.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"St. Albans District Council","length":"58.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
