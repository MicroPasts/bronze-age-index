The socket is incomplete, but tapers towards the blade. The socket is broken into two portions and has further fragments which are missing. On the exterior surface there is a trace of a side loop, the loop on the other side is completely missing. There is a fragment of the blade on either side of the socket, but the upper edge is broken, and this break is not recent, but the surface of the break does not have the same patina as the outer surface of the spear. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has a dark shiny brown coloured patina.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead fragments measure 47.15mm in length and 12.16mm width/thickness. The second smaller piece measures 24.43mm in length and 12.12mm in width. The spearhead weighs 16.2g combined. Combined length is 71.58mm.\n\n\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.0314004","fourFigureLon":"-2.04514052","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"December 31, 1943","datefound2":"December 31, 1985","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carina Hughes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Beckford","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW76B07A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"71.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
