This edge is slightly abraded and pitted. There is a flange on either side of the axe which leads to the blade. The flanges appear to have been hammered, the sides of the flanges have a series of very shallow indentations. The septum is only slightly pitted. At the mid point, across the septum there are two shallow grooves, thereby forming a slight ridge between which is the bevel/stop. This occurs on both faces of the septum. The grooves are shallow and feel like ripples. The blade expands from the septum. The junction of the septum and blade has a slightly uneven, ripples surface on both faces, this does not appear to be intentional. On one surface of the blade there has been recent damage, a scrape, perhaps by the plough has occurred revealing the metal. The blade tips are slightly rounded and abraded. The blade cutting edge is abraded and slightly corroded, therefore the original edge is lost. The axe has a well developed brown/green coloured patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.732272","fourFigureLon":"-1.705259","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"November 01, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Catton","county":"Derbyshire","district":"South Derbyshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/Wmid4305.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"121.18"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
