The razor is trapezoidal in plan with two suspension loops above a row of four 'hanging triangles' or triangular openwork. The blade edge is only 2 mm in thickness. There is some damage to each side of the blade where it expands to a pointed apex, now missing. There is a small patch of green corrosion where one of these edges is folded, but apart from that, the razor is in an excellent and stable condition and has a dark brown patina.\n\n\n\nType Unterstall or Poiseul razors have trapezoidal shaped blades, a strengthening rib between the two rings and the blade and have, like Felkirch or Bernissart razors, decorative perforations in the upper part of the blade. However, while the perforations in Feldkirch or Bernissart razors are circular or rectangular, Unterstall or Poiseul razors have triangular ones. Jockenhövel lists their main distribution in southern France, southwest Bavaria and northern Germany, with finds from, for example: Magny-Lambert, Dép. Côte-d'Or and Poiseul-la-Ville-et-La-Perrière, Dép. Côte-d'Or (Jockenhövel 1980, 176-177). He suggests that, in general, their region of origin would have been somewhere in Western Europe where these razors of Type Unterstall or Poiseul, along with razors of Types Felkirch or Bernissart, Endingen and Flörsheim, represented the most typical group of Early Iron Age razors. Jockenhövel's suggested Western European distribution of this type can now be underlined with seven new finds from the southern half of England: Wickham Skeith, Suffolk; St Alban's, Hertfordshire; Salisbury/Netherhampton hoard, Wiltshire; Bowerchalke, Wiltshire; Royston, Cambridgeshire, recorded in LANCUM-DB7650; Attleborough, Norfolk, recorded in NMS-01D7D8, and this example from near Newbury in Berkshire. Early Iron Age razors like these are usually found singly or in hoards, and another individual one has come up recently from Milnthorpe, Cumbria, recorded in LANCUM-220D90 (Dot Boughton pers comm).\n\n\n\nRef: Jockenhoevel, A.
