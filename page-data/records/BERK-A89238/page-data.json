The awl has a square cross section in the centre, from where the awl tapers to a rounded point at one end and aflattened point at the other - this flattened end was probably the tang and the tool would have been inserted into a wooden or bone handle. The patina on the awl is a deep even green. Together with the size and form of the awl, the patina suggests a late Bronze Age date (c. 1250-700 BC), although leather working tools did not change from this period through into the Roman period and even into the medieval period.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-700","notes":"\nPart of a larger collection purchased from a car boot sale.
