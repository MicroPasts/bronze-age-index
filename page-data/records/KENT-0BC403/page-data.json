Probable rounded subrectangular mouth with moulded double bands around the rim. The bronze axe was far more effective than its stone counterpart and allowed large areas of ancient forest to be cleared for farmsteads and cultivation. This inturn lead to a rise in the population levels. There appears to be some wear, otherwise an attractive green patina with a few light scratches and one small spot pale green corrosion where the surface has chipped away. This is likely to date between 900-600BC. Ref.
