The form is sub-triangular in cross-section and in plan. One side of the triangular cross-section curves inwards and the other two are slightly convex creating a broadly central arris along its length.  There is a break at the wider end that to one side curves into a slight flange, with another break at the narrow apex end. The shape is reminiscent of Medieval to Post Medieval cooking vessel handles or legs but the light green matt patina is more suggestive of Bronze Age artefacts, albeit the precise nature of the object remains unidentified. For this reason a very wide date range is suggested at circa 1000 BC AD1700, however, the consensus is much more towards the earlier date.","fourFigureLat":"52.72520219","fourFigureLon":"0.8565404","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"1700","notes":"Note: This object was found in the same field as a Bronze Age hammer head (NMS-7D35CC at around 250yd separation). However, it has not been possible to definitively date this object to the same period and accordingly the two have not been declared as treasure. If further Bronze Age artefacts come to light in the immediate vicinity the new finds will have to be considered as potential treasure.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"January 01, 2011","datefound2":"October 25, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mileham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/64045_7DE817_LBA_UO.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"23.89"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
