The axe is broken before the butt end and has a crescent shaped chunk missing at the break. It is very worn and suffers from corrosion, with a green copper corrosion product visible on both sides of the surface. The axe flares in width from 22.9 mm at the break to 57.14 mm at the widest point of the blade. It is 8.8 mm thick and weighs 122.5 grams. It would originally have been about 85 mm long, but is now 63.2 mm in length. Other than the areas of green corrosion the axe has a purple/brown patina and is very rough.","fourFigureLat":"52.579636","fourFigureLon":"-1.794828","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2000","notes":"Post recording, Finder got the elemental composition of the flat axehead assessed.
