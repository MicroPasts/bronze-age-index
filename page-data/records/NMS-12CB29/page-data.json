It exhibits a narrow butt (23mm in width, 3mm in thickness). The body is slender and expands along its length to a width of 51.8mm. The sides exhibit high, inward-curved flanges forming a lenticular profile (maximum thickness 20.5mm, tapering to 12.5mm at the top of the blade). Most of the surface is now heavily corroded and pitted, however, one flage retains traces of decoration in the form of a series of punched chevrons. It is probable that this decoration originally covered the extent of both flanges.\n\n\n\nThe blade expands obliquely from either side of the axehead at the point the flanges terminate, forming a crescentic cuttring edge (width: 97.5mm). This has been somewhat aberaded and is now obscured somewhat by corrosion product.\n\n\n\nIt has a curved bevel or ridge about halfway down the septum (c.52mm from the butt), which is marginally lower than the flanges, but indicates the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. This is clearer on the better preserved face of the axehead. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion.\n\n\n\nSee: Needham, S.P., 1983 The Early Bronze Age Axeheads Of Central and Southern England Cardiff : Unpublished Phd Thesis","fourFigureLat":"52.86707083","fourFigureLon":"1.28195351","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"February 04, 2018","datefound2":"February 04, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hanworth","county":"Norfolk","district":"North Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jshoemark5/59748_12CB29_BA_Axehead.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"139"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
