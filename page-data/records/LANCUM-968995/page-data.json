The ring is bi-conical in form, with flat triangular terminals. There is a prominent ridge running around the outer edge. Both faces are decorated by transverse, parallel striations. There is some damage to the inner edge of one of the faces, where the two sheets have come apart slightly.\n\n\n\nDiameter: 28.69mm, thickness: 8.86mm, weight: 7.25g\n\n\n\nThere are a number of similar examples recorded on the database, including: NCL-066786 (2019 T94), SUSS-5EA230 (2017 T349), ESS-5ECCA2 (2016 T592) and SUR-EFB639 (2019 T87). This type of object is well-represented from late Bronze Age contexts, although the precise function of these rings remains unclear.\n\n\n\nAs the object is an item of prehistoric precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","fourFigureLat":"54.12920974","fourFigureLon":"-3.1645186","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Miss.
