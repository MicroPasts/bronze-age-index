The blade is narrow tapering and the axe is narrow and unlooped. The blade is flared and the surface is smooth, bevelled and sharpened. The butt is broken and the patination suggests that it was broken in antiquity. The axe has a well-defined stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. The septum is H-shaped in section and is smooth, unworn and slightly concave. At the end of the septum is a moulded shield-shaped stop-ridge set transversely across the body. The patination is a mid-green with areas of dark grey patination on both faces of the septum. The length is 100.22mm, the width is at the blade is 37.16mm and at the butt is 21.94mm. Its thickness is 6.62mm at the blade, 11.30mm at the butt and 19.66mm at the stop ridge. It weighs 166.2g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops or midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group I (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC. It can be distinguished by its shield-shaped decoration below the stop ridge (p.119).\n\n\n\nSchmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.\n\n\n\nThe concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects can be found on the database at LVPL-3EFEA7 and LVPL-84EBD1.","fourFigureLat":"54.34817451","fourFigureLon":"-2.75531965","fromdate":"1500","todate":"1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ann Lipscombe","datefound1":"June 28, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ann Lipscombe","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.66","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Burneside","county":"Cumbria","district":"South Lakeland","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/benwestwood/DURFE8A86.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"100.22"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
