The flaring head has a slight chamfer at the upper edge and the top is very slightly concave. Below the head there is a band of multiple fine incised lines and three broad bands of multiple incised oblique lines (those in the central band are reversed), the lower edge of this decoration is damaged where the pin is slightly bent and the rest of the circular-sectioned shaft is undecorated with the terminal broken in antiquity and now worn smooth. Extant length (unbent) 49.5mm. Diameter of head 5.5mm. Weighs 2.85g.\n\n\n\nUnlike the large 'Picardy' pins of the Middle Bronze Age, this small pin has no swelling on the shaft. However, as with Picardy pins, it is likely to belong to the 'Ornament horizon' phase of the late Taunton or early Penard phase of the later mid Bronze Age, approximately 1400-1250 BC.\n\n\n\n(Finder's number DW7-97)","fourFigureLat":"52.66011745","fourFigureLon":"0.55651466","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Steven Ashley","datefound1":"December 12, 2017","datefound2":"January 08, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Steven Ashley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"5.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Narborough","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/51091_99743CMBA_Pin.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"49.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
