The object is three-dimensional and consists of a single drooping ovoid element with pointed tips. These ovoid is decorated with multiple grooves running down the body but stopping before the tip. The base of the ovoid is flat and reveals a hollow interior; at this point at the rim is a circular hole that passes through both sides passing through both sides. \n\nA number of these have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database, including WMID-CA9D04, BH-037A57 and SF-520513. There is some variation in these objects. &nbsp;One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117), and as such, they are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example. Many form the terminal of a bar shaped object that has a hole passing through the centre, these are solid one piece castings and have led to the theory that they could be dagger fittings. However this example was riveted in place via a pin that passes horizontally through the mount, this type of attachment may have proven to be too delicate for a dagger. The absence of clear archaeological evidence makes the true use of these objects conjectural, but it entirely likely that this style of object may have had a number of uses.","fourFigureLat":"52.02241099","fourFigureLon":"-1.95769116","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"May 26, 2022","datefound2":"July 04, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dumbleton","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Tewkesbury","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO49A053.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
