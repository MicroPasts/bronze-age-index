Walter Moore, it passed into the hands of his son, Mr. Charles Moore, of the Hollies Ellesmere, at whose death it was given to the Ellesmere Museum by his executor.","museumCollection":"Ellesmere Museum","museumID":"","collectionIdentifier":"","stolenStatus":"","imageCopyrightHolder":null,"length":"467"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
