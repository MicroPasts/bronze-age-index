There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both domed sides of the object, the tapering lower parts are plain. The two moustache tips or prongs flare slightly outwards and terminate with a small rounded knop. The central neck section of the object is plain and undecorated but the underside (between the two prongs) has a squared perforation, now filled with iron corrosion, presumably from whatever object the 'moustache' was mount on to.","fourFigureLat":"51.65244492","fourFigureLon":"-1.43767284","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-300","notes":"These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45 and BH-AA1CBE.\n\n\n\nThe open area at the centre of the object suggests it was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"June 03, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017188.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"21.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
