The object is a single cast chisel with a flat bladed terminal that widens towards the middle of the piece before tapering down to a point which is now worn and broken. There is no decoration on the object and it has an dark orange&nbsp;brown patina. Small chisels and tools of this type were used for an extensive period of time, not simply in the Bronze age, but also in later periods for jewellery making and fine work. As such dating the object is difficult. The awl measures 35.2mm in length, 4.7mm in maximum thickness, and weighs 1.86g.","fourFigureLat":"51.85318387","fourFigureLon":"-0.68018029","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"August 10, 2022","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cheddington","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwin/BUC7CC0A8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"35.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
