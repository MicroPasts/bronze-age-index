The item consists of the socket, pierced on both sides near the open end for a rivet or similar, and a short section of blade. The socket is 32.24mm in length, and oval in cross section, tapering in thickness from 12.30mm at the open end to 8.13mm at the point where the blade begins. It is 19.92mm in width. The metal of the socket is c2.10mm thick. It appears to have been made of two pieces soldered together, with one seam slightly flattened. The rivet holes are c4.75mm in diameter.\n\n\n\nThe blade is 5.45mm thick, stepped in from the base of the socket and tapering over a length of 28.50mm to 3.38mm thick.at which point there is an old break. It is sub lozengiform in cross section, the blade narrowing from c19.90mm to 17.05mm at the break. There is no evidence, in this length of blade, of a curve or serration, other than some wear to both edges. At the point of the break, the flat of blade appears to be curling upwards but this might have occurred at the same time as the break rather than being part of the original design.\n\n\n\nThe item is 61mm in length overall and weighs 30.77g. It has a green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.30310049","fourFigureLon":"-1.92966281","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Hanbidge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Hanbidge","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Urchfont","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/flojohnstone/IMG_5852f.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
