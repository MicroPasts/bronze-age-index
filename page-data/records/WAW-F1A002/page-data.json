The central / lower midrib, both side loops and some of the socketed mouth of the spear survive. The rest is missing due to old breaks. Originally, the spear would have had a leaf-shaped blade. In plan, the midrib is slightly wider at the base, narrowing gradually to the break. The complete, but now sealed, side loops project to either side. The midrib section is circular and hollow, although soil is now present in the cavity. Soil adheres to the surfaces of the spear, but areas of a shiny, mid green patina are visible. All surfaces of the spear are heavily abraded due to movement in the plough soil.\n\n\n\nLength: 46.43mm. Width: 15.57mm. Thickness: 12.37mm. Weight: 13.8g.\n\n\n\nA similar spearhead can be viewed on the database: ESS-EBFB42. Comparable side-looped spears with circular midribs are recorded in Rowlands: 1976, plates 37-38\n\n\n\nRef: Rowlands, M.J., The Organisation of Middle Bronze Age Metalworking.
