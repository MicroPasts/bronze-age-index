The more complete face is likely to have broken just below the mouth but with no mouth moulding surviving. The socket has a moderately consistent rectangular profile (29mm x 19mm and with a surviving depth of 67.5mm). The longer side has the stub of the loop surviving just below the break (with a surviving height of 9.0mm). The sides are near-straight, gently convex and divergent before a moderate out-turning at the blade tips (giving a blade width of 54.3mm). The sides are perpendicular to the faces and straight across their thickness. The casting seams are discernible and were finished but the detail has been removed through corrosion. The blade edge has a slight curvature with some damage. The faces are gradually convergent with no blade facets and have a shallow convexity across their length and are near-flat across their widths, producing a rectangular body section (with a maximum surviving body width, below the loop of 38mm). The faces were decorated with vertical parallel ribs and the more complete face appears to have had 6 ribs, with the two outermost ribs following the edges of the face. Striations are evident running between the ribs.  The surface has a dark-brown patina partially preserved, with pale-green corrosion elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe missing mouth makes any typological identification uncertain, the form and size of the axe would suggest the axe type to be a Southern English ribbed axe, which Needham (1990, p 32)[2] called Class B and if the axe also had a double-mouth moulding may have been similar to his B1 axe but with a less expanded blade edge. Southern English ribbed axes are not commonly recovered from South Wales and together with occasional Carp’s Tongue components in Ewart Park hoards, perhaps begin to suggest a degree of contact between western and South Eastern Britain at the start of the 1st millennium BC, which may be observed proportionately less in South Eastern Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140\n\n\n\n[2] Needham, S. 1990; The Petters Late Bronze Age Metalwork; An Analytical Study of Thames Valley metalworking in its settlement context; Department of Prehistoric and Romano-British Antiquities 1990; British Museum Occasional Paper 70","fourFigureLat":"51.67171896","fourFigureLon":"-4.90825887","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pembroke","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2016197.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"104"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
