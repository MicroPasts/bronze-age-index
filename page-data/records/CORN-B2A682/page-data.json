The mouth would have been sub-rectangular in plan. The surface is worn and pitted, especially along the casting seams, but there is a layer on one face that remains so that three ribs are still visible, between the side edges of the axe head. The ribs extend down about three quarters of the length of the body of the axe head, and the central rib is more pronounced and appears to be the longest. Half of the other face is missing, and has exposed the organic material still held within the axe. The sides of the body of the axe are parallel until they reach the blade which is slightly flanged. The cutting edge and blade tips are still intact, if somewhat abraded. The axe is 83 mm long, 30 mm wide at the break below the mouth and 37 mm wide at the blade, 20 mm in depth and 3 mm in thickness. Stogursey or South Wales type socketed axe head Ewart Park Phase, c.1000-800 BC Rohl & Needham (1998) illustrate a similar example on page 136, Fig.38, No.344, which is referred to as a Stogursey axe and is dated to the Ewart Park phase of metalwork, c.1000-800 BC. Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example from St. Erth, that is in Penzance Museum, on page 565, Plate 4, No.43a, which is classified as a Stogursey-type socketed axe.","fourFigureLat":"50.372491","fourFigureLon":"-4.701432","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"April 30, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tywardreath and Par","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Junfinds 016.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
