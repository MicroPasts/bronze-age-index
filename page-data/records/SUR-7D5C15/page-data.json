The axe is in reasonable condition although the blade is damaged and appears to be laminating. There is also much surface iron staining and patches of the surface are missing in a number of places. There are surface scratches on one side only. The socket at the rim measures 30.72mm x 28.17mm. The axe is a dull olive brown except for the base of the socket which is patinated bright green.\n\n\n\nThe axe is of Southeastern type. It has a slight swelling collar level with the top of the loop. The axe appears unused as the stubs of both runners (where the molten metal led into the mould) project above the socket, and the seams have not been filed smooth.","fourFigureLat":"51.204293","fourFigureLon":"-0.555663","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"\nThis axe, apparently unused, may have been intended as a votive deposit, particularly in view of its valley bottom location.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"September 30, 2011","datefound2":"October 23, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"39.51","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wonersh","county":"Surrey","district":"Waverley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCN4401.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"98.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
