Two additional amorphous copper-alloy fragments were also found in the immediate vicinity. Total weight 125g.\n\n\n\n1. Small butt-end fragment of a flanged palstave. Oblique brittle fracture, pitted dark brown patination with green around eroded edges. Extant length 35mm, width 18mm, weight 35g.\n\n\n\n2. Triangular tip fragment of a spearhead. Sharp midrib giving a star-like cross section. Transverse brittle fracture. Dark brown patination. Length 41mm, width 17.7mm, thickness 7.6mm, weight 9g.\n\n\n\n3. Crescent-shaped cutting edge fragment probably from a palstave. Blade width almost complete, with one side truncated just short of the full width. Curved brittle and broadly transverse fracture across the crescentic edge (maximum width in centre of fragment 15mm) Dark brown pitted patination very similar to 1, and could be opposite ends of the same object. Length 59mm, thickness 6.5mm, weight 18g.\n\n\n\n4. Blade fragment of a socketed chisel, flaring from 15mm to 27mm over its 41mm extant length. Broken towards the butt end with the thin-walled socket (0.9mm) pushed in from one side causing a crease down towards the blade end. The socket neck at the point of fracture was originally oval, extending to a maximum depth of 33mm into the 41mm extant length of the chisel. Weight 14.72g. \n\n\n\n5. Amorphous sub-ovoid globule with matching patination and colouration to other objects. Maximum length 18mm, maximum thickness 9.2mm, weight 10g.\n\n\n\n6. Unidentified fragment with exposed uncorroded scraped bare metal on both faces, probably as a result of recent cultivation damage. The object has some form, with what appear to be original edges, but the parent object cannot be determined. Length 58mm, maximum width 18mm, weight 38g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion and Date: Objects 1 to 3 are possibly Middle Bronze Age in date, but as fragments the diagnostic features that position them more precisely in the period are missing. Socketed chisels (object 4) are known in the late Middle Bronze Age and are transitional into the late Bronze Age. Items 5 and 6 cannot be identified, but although these are largely amorphous and cannot be identified in isolation as part of the hoard, the proximity within the group and the nature of the material strongly suggests they are an integral part of the deposition made in the late Middle Bronze Age. It is possible, however, that they were gathered together at a later date.","fourFigureLat":"52.39685663","fourFigureLon":"1.04109525","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1001","notes":"The finds are all of Bronze Age date and as they represent a single find of two or more copper-alloy finds of prehistoric date, they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"February 22, 2019","datefound2":"April 03, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"","quantity":"6","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bressingham","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/63363_833D15_MBA_Palstave1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
