The decoration consists of three longitudinal panels, each one made from a pair of relief lines or creases with  corresponding grooves on the reverse, so either pushed out from the reverse (the repoussé technique) or hammered over a  shaped former or patrix.  Each of the panels is filled with two longitudinal rows of punched dots, some set in pairs and others offset to give a zig-zag effect. The punch used was circular and round-ended.\n\n\n\nEach short edge is broken, but each straight long edge has about 2mm in width neatly folded over to the reverse; the fold runs along the outermost of the relief lines. The entire object is now crumpled.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Maximum surviving length 40mm. The width varies due to the crumpled condition, from a minimum of 13mm in the centre to a maximum of 17mm at one end. The sheet is perhaps 0.25mm thick and the folded areas are a maximum of 1.5mm thick. It weighs 3.0g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion and Date: Rectangular gold strips with dot or pointillé decoration have been recorded on the PAS database at BUC-4313C7, PAS-35C8A8 and WAW-FF1E9A, and longitudinal creases have been recorded at WILT-34D958. This example has relatively complex decoration, but otherwise fits well into a group of ribbon or strip ornaments of early to middle Bronze Age date, c. 2350 to 1000 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.77234469","fourFigureLon":"1.12653068","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-1000","notes":"As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\n\nENF145877\n\n\n\nDrawing by Jason Gibbons","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Helen Geake","datefound1":"March 02, 2019","datefound2":"March 02, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Adrian Marsden","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Salle","county":"Norfolk","district":"Broadland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/PFd_29231_342C53_AMD042019_BA_Diadem.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"40"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
