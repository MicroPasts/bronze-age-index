In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentic cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It is proceed by a double raised collar. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have been worked down either through hammering or filing/polishing, but remain fairly prominant particularly towards the collar end. The blade edge has some wear but remains in good conditions. The side loop remains on one side. The axehead has a dark greenish well formed patina with some slightly lighter mottling in places, but is fairly restricted although may be areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Length of 91mm, with a width (at widest) 39.8mm wide, thickness 31.5mm and a weight: 164g","fourFigureLat":"51.21579719","fourFigureLon":"1.14876081","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"February 28, 1998","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston","county":"Kent","district":"Canterbury","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTC1D0F3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"91"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
