Probably a ribbed South Eastern variant. The axehead is complete and has suffered little damage, however some of the surface bronze has been lost from the blade edge. The blade edge is crescentic with both outer tips complete - there appears to have been little if any use of the blade. The axehead's socket is rectangular at the mouth and tapers through the length of the socket. Casting seams are prominent within the socket but are not visible externally. The socket has a rasied lip which slopes sharply and evenly to the main section of the axe. Externally there are three rasied ribs from the back of the socket towards the middle of the main body - the centre of the these ribs corresponds with the internal casting seam. There is a single side loop on one edge of the axehead.\n\n\n\nThe axe head measures 84.9mm long, 43mm wide (blade) and the internal socket width is 22.5mm. The axehead weighs 167.5 grams.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017259.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"84.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
