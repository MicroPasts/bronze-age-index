The mouth of the socket is almost a square, with rounded corners and convex sides. On two interior edges, opposite each other, there is a slight semi-circular moulded platform. The socket is 92.31mm deep and tapers in depth more than it tapers in width. The rim of the mouth is abraded and undulating because of the abrasion. The socketed mouth moulding on the exterior just has a single sub-triangular sectioned collar.\n\n\n\nThe sides of the axe have a slender casting seam, with the seam, on one face, curving over the integral loop. The loop s D-shaped with a sub-oval perforation which has traces of the casting seam within it. The faces of the axe are slightly narrower than the sides, causing the sides to be slightly faceted and rounded. The sides taper towards the blade edge\n\n\n\nThe axe faces appear to be flat and undecorated. There is surface abrasion and the faces have lost some of their patina. The edges of the faces have parallel sides and a splayed cutting edge. The blade tips are rounded and the cutting edge is abraded, very worn and is slightly convex. The cutting edge may have been sharpened extensively as the blade edge is quite thick and does not have the bevel you occasionally see. There is not decoration on the axe.\n\n\n\nThe axe measures 111.27mm long, 66.05mm wide across the blade tips, 40.08mm thick across the mouth moulding and weighs 324g. The socket mouth interior measurements are 27.82mm long and 27.49mm wide.\n\n\n\nDr Dot Boughton considers the axe to be transitional late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, therefore dated c. 900-700 BC and that it is a late chunky Ewart Park type with a square to sub-rectangular mouth.","fourFigureLat":"52.32742301","fourFigureLon":"-2.39760518","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"September 30, 2016","datefound2":"January 12, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"40.08","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rock","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wyre Forest","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWBA32B4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"111.27"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
