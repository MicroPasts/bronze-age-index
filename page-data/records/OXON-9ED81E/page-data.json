They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). &#39;Awl&#39; is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as &quot;pointed punches&quot; by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin.","fourFigureLat":"51.64410719","fourFigureLon":"-1.59674678","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"January 01, 2022","datefound2":"August 17, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.62","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Faringdon","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ambolton/OXON9ED81E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"59.56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
