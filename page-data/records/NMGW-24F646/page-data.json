The butt has suffered a little damage making the type identification difficult and slightly speculative, but appears to have been straight with a surviving width of 32.9mm and a thickness of 4.5mm. The sides of the axe are comparatively straight and are very slightly concave. The sides are also straight across their thickness, giving the axe a rectangular profile. The axe has a maximum width at the blade of 66.21mm. The blade edge has a shallow curve and is unexpanded. Both faces of the axe are convex, producing a lenticular long profile, with a maximum thickness 38mm from the blade of 12.89mm. The surface of the axe has differential preservation, with a pale green to pale brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.977015","fourFigureLon":"-4.928003","fromdate":"-2400","todate":"-2200","notes":"Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency and to make the analyses comparable with other results. Results obtained suggest the axe has a composition made up nearly entirely of copper and is broadly consistent with Northover's (1980, pp 230) metal type 'A'. Metallurgical sampling of the axe may provide greater accuracy on the metallurgical composition. Axes of this type can be attributed to Metalwork Assemblage II, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 1 of the British Bronze Age. The axe is likely to date to between c. 2,400 - 2,200BC","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cwm Gwaun","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200666.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"98.55"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
