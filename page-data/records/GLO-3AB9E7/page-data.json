The blades of the spearhead are leaf-shaped; both blades have a wide and curved base (20mm in diameter) that narrow to the pointed tip. Separating the two blades is a diamond cross-section spine/rib (7mm high in the middle) that runs the runs down the length of the head. Below the socket is circular in cross-section and expands outwards to the aperture (15mm in diameter). Halfway down the socket, on both sides, is a shallow convex projecting loop that has a very narrow rectangular aperture (3.5mm long by 1.5mm wide)\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar spears are HESH-CFC925, HESH-CE6980 and WAW-DC8222. These records note that similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age, specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).\n\n\n\nWAW-DC8222 also comments that the loops on socketed spearheads would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.","fourFigureLat":"51.41011217","fourFigureLon":"-2.46148235","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"March 31, 2018","datefound2":"August 31, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Saltford","county":"Bath and North East Somerset","district":"Bath and North East Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO3AB9E7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"107"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
