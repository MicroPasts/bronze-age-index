Only the tip of the blade survives, and this tapers from 45.3 mm wide at the tip to 37.3 mm at the break. Part of the socket survives as a sub-rectangular recess in the centre of the blade at the break. Wear and an even patina at the break suggests that this occurred in antiquity. The surface of the axe head is worn and pitted, and has a dark green to black patina. Not enough of the axe survives to allow definitive classification, but the form of the fragment suggests that is from a socketed axe head of the late Bronze Age, from circa 1150-800 BC. The fragment is 45.3 mm wide, 11.2 mm thick, 23.6 mm long and weighs 38.7 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.714499","fourFigureLon":"-2.193876","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"July 31, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lapley, Stretton and Wheaton Aston","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/axehead fragment reduced.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"23.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
