The end of the circular socket is present at the break (where it has a surviving depth of 17.6mm and an internal diameter at the break of 7.0mm). The socket continues along the blade as a prominent and rounded midrib (giving a maximum surviving thickness of 9.2mm at the break), which gradually narrows and thins towards the tip. The blade edges have been lost and the current blade edge is near-straight or slightly convex. A subtle blade facet is discernible where the surface is preserved, before a flat area, running parallel to the midrib (with a width of 1.4mm). The surface has a dark green patina where it survives and elsewhere is pale green.\n\n\nSocketed spearheads begin in the Acton Park metalworking industry dated to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age and continue to the Llyn Fawr Industry at the very end of the Bronze Age, although spearheads of the Llyn Fawr industry are rarely recovered, with most spearheads dating to the Ewart Park phase or before. Needham (1997) dates the corresponding Industries from his Period 5, begging c. 1500BC to the end of Period 7 at c. 750BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.419422","fourFigureLon":"-1.627488","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"July 20, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ramsbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.42.1i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"50.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
