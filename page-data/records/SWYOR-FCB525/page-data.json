The remaining portion consists of a short length of the socket and the U shaped blade. The interior of the socket is circular and 9.9mm deep; the exterior is sub-rectangular. The blade tapers from the socket to a rounded cutting edge. The gouge is concave on one face and convex on the other. It has a dark green patina and the breaks are very abraded. It is 39.9mm long, 14.1mm wide and 13.9mm thick. It weighs 22.8gm. The socket is 7.8mm in diameter, the groove is 35.4mm long and the cutting edge is 11.1mm wide.\n\n\n\nCompare SUR-7898C5 which notes that: \"Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).\"","fourFigureLat":"54.12480562","fourFigureLon":"-1.49656027","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-650","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"August 31, 2014","datefound2":"September 14, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bridge Hewick","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2382_gouge.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"39.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
