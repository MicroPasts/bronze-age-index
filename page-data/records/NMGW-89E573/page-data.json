The butt is square with a width of 24mm and is tapered to a thickness of 3mm. The sides are divergent and are straight for some 50mm before they become concave to the expanded blade. The sides are moderately flat across their thickness, but appear to have been hammered towards the centre. The axe is thickest near its centre at 11.5mm. The blade is wide at 88.69mm with only a slightly curved blade edge. The blade facet begins 10mm from the current (eroded) blade edge. Both faces are gently convex and no decoration is evident. One face has a prominent casting flaw, probably caused by an air bubble (8mm diameter, 3.4mm deep) within a hollowed area. The axe has a green brown patina with peripheral areas of surface loss (light to mid green colour). One face is currently suffering from active bronze corrosion.\n\n\n\nNote - Peter Reavill - 18/5/21.\n\n\n\nThis axe appears in Stuart Needham 2017: The Classification of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age Copper and Bronze Axe-head from Souther Britain.as his Cat No: 32","fourFigureLat":"51.55470943","fourFigureLon":"-4.06404546","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-2050","notes":"Aquired by Roger Mcilroy who reported the find to Swansea Museum. More than 30 Migdale flat axes have been recorded from Wales, with a concentration in south-east Wales (Savory 1980, pp 43) .
