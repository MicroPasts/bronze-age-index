The upper is flat and the bottom is convex. Only a small section remains with a part of the original edge and very worn irregular breaks on the other sides. The section of the outside edge is too small to idenify the complete diameter. The ingot is pitted likely due to a mix of impurities in its matrix and the uneven natural material used to create the bowl in which it was cast.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is 65.4mm by 51.2mm and 23.8mm thick; it weighs 291g.\n\n\n\nBowl furnaces were developed during the Mediterranean Bronze Age, becoming popular in Britain in the Late Bronze Age and were used intermittently to the modern era for many types of metal.","fourFigureLat":"51.2493853","fourFigureLon":"0.89307981","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"This fragment was found in the same area as several hoards containing ingots, 2017 897, 898 and 901, however it is not clear which, if any it is assocated with. The very worn, patinated breaks sugest this has not recently been disturbed from a hoard. On the advice of the Kent FLO this has therefore not been reported under the Treasure Act 1996 as it is not certain it was original deposited with or in association with any of the other pieces.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"September 15, 2017","datefound2":"September 16, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Badlesmere","county":"Kent","district":"Swale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elburnett/SOMC304F9.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"65.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
