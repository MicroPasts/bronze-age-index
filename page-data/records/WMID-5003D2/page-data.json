BC 1500 to c. BC 1150.\n\n\n\nThe object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a blunt point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There are traces of small sides loops. There is damage to both edges of the blade.\n\n\n\nIt measures 59.8 mm in length, 14.2 mm wide (base), 11.6 mm wide (tip) and 11.8 mm thick. The walls are 2.5 mm thick. The side loops are 14.6 mm long by 3.0 mm wide. They extend 2.5 mm away from the body of the spear head. The socket has a surviving depth of 53.7 mm. It weighs 18.5 g.\n\n\n\nThe spear head is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThis object has lost most of it's diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult. However similar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including SWYOR-1F74C1, SF-C557DC and WMID-270D2F. All have been dated to the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"52.62446714","fourFigureLon":"-1.73552837","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"The 3D model has been generated using the mobile phone scanning application Qlone.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"September 16, 2017","datefound2":"September 16, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fazeley","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/wmid5003d2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"59.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
