The cutting edge has a pronounced crescentic form with the tips re-curving back onto the expanding form of the blade body. The body has a well-defined stop ridge just short of midway down its length and the flanges extend and taper, down to the blade section. There are clear casting lines down each side of the axe, there are no other design elements to be seen. There is a loop to one side at the juncture between blade and septum.\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic features of this palstave are its long thing blade, only slightly crescent stopridge, a wide but shallow midrib and an attatchment loop. These are all characteristics highlighted by Schmidt and Burgess (1981: pl 62) for the Shelf variant of transtional palstaves. similarly Rowlands (1976: plate 32) illustrates similar forms all categorised as narrow bladed palstaves. Both studies suggest a late Middle Bronze age date in the Penard to Wilburton/Wallington phase of the Bronze Agec.1250 -1000 cal BC.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lewknor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bertie123/BERKBAB433Looped.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"178.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
