The axe has broken near the base of the socket (with a length of 31.0mm, a surviving width of 9.9mm and a maximum surviving depth of 9.1mm). The axe is of sub-rectangular section at the break (where the axe has a width of 41mm and a maximum thickness of 18.0mm). The casting flashes are clear and raised on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The sides curve outwards a little to produce a slightly expanded edge (producing a surviving blade width of 46.9mm). The blade faces are convex across both their lengths and width with no discernible blade facets and the original blade edge has been lost. There are no ribs extending onto the blade fragment. Where the surface survives, sharpening striations are evident running along the blade edge. Hammering facets are also discernible on both faces. The surface has a dark brown patination and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion.\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the axe makes typological identification difficult; the form of the fragment is consistent with South Wales Type socketed axes. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although most recovered socketed axes, including the South Wales type are of the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"May 04, 2010","datefound2":"June 18, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Myddfai","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.130.1i.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"33.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
