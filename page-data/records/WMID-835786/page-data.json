The transverse butt is slightly uneven and incomplete.  The septum is flat on both sides of the palstave. Flanges surround the septum, except at the butt.  These flanges increase in height towards the blade, with the zenith at the curved stop.  The protruding stop is positioned over a third of the way down the palstave.  There is a loop between the stop and the blade on one of the sides of the palstave.  There is some visible evidence of casting flashes running down the centre of both sides, but this is rather indistinct.  Below the stop the blade flares outwards towards the curved blade tips which are splayed. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge.  Below the butt, and running approximately half way down the blade, is a decoration formed by a raised “V” with a raised sub-triangular design nested within. This points towards the blade.\n\nThe palstave has a dark brown patina. It is in very good condition other than a number of pitted areas of the surface, an incision on one side of the blade, and some damage to the cutting edge, blade tip, and butt.  The maximum dimensions of the Palstave are 138.5mm long, 66.6 mm wide at the blade, and 34.9mm wide across the butt. It is above the maximum weight of the scales used.\n\nBuilding on work by Smith (1959), Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p128) identify a group of palstaves as Early Palstaves Group III: Low Flanged (Broad Blade) Palstaves.  These always have a broad blade, splaying to a fan shape, and wide at the edge.  The palstave described in this record appears to fit most closely within this category.  Furthermore, within Group III, this palstave appears to most closely fit into the Type Carleton.  These are looped low flanged palstaves with an expanded edge and protruding blade tips.  The decoration is usually a version of the trident pattern, either an all ribbed trident or a long rib bisecting a shield.  A similar example to the palstave described in this record is catalogue reference 829, in Schmidt and Burgess (1981, plate 60), although this has a more distinct midrib than the example described in this record.\n\nSchmidt and Burgess (1981) argue that the Low Flanged (Broad Blade) palstaves were a logical development from the shield pattern and early midribbed palstaves which preceeded them. They also suggest that, based on evidence of hoards, the type were superseded by Smith’s (1959) transitional form.\n\nThe palstave fits within Needham’s Period 5 (Middle Bronze Age,1500-1150).","fourFigureLat":"52.893604","fourFigureLon":"-2.447362","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Duncan Slarke","datefound1":"June 20, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Duncan Slarke","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"34.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Loggerheads","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Newcastle-under-Lyme","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/WMID-835786.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"138.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
