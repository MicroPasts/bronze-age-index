There were also in the same find spot 2 sherds of pottery both Roman, 1 fragment of vitrified glass one lithic implement probably a microlith. The Roman finds are invasive and therefore do not form part of the treasure case likewise the microlith is likely to be Mesolithic and residual. All were discovered together in a pit with large sub-rectangular sandstones some of which were utilised to weigh down the objects.\n\n\n\nAt the bottom of the pit were three spearheads all laid out in a line with two large heavy rings adjacent to the left. One of the socketed axes was between two sandstones. Then armrings and two wrist torcs were sandwiched between two socketed axe heads underneath and was another socketed axe head on top a socketed chisel.\n\n\n\nMixed in the soil of the deposition were a number of finds. A wood fragment was recovered measuring in length 52mm, with a width of 15mm, thicknessof 6mm and weighing 2.96g, it could relate to the hafting of one of the axes or spears. Also discovered with the deposition were two fragments of pottery one a creamy fabric with a shell temper measuring 30mm in length, 25mm in width, is 11mm thick and weighing 12.61g. The fabric is slightly soft with a powdery surface. It is an off-white colour and has a fine texture. The sherd was probably made at Mancetter, Warwickshire. Mortaria from Mancetter dates to the 2nd to 4th centuries (Tyers 1996). The sherd is slightly abraded and is only a fragment of the complete vessel. The other sherd measuring 39mm in length, 27mm in width, is 8mm thick and weighng 12.70g probably a sherd of Roman Black Burnished ware dating to the period c. AD 43 - 410. Possibly from a WA Type 20 \"dog-dish\" (Seagar-Smith 1993). The fabric is a black with a shell temper. Also discovered was a fragment of Roman vitirified glass measuring in length 20mm, width 8mm, thickness 4mm and weighing 2.0g. The glass is severely affected by extreme burning and is now vitrified. The fragment is irregularly shaped and exhibits a series of breaks. A further find of a lithic implement microlith was also discovered which is probably residual measuring in length, 11mm with a width of 4mm, thickness 2mm and weighing 0.19g. Probably a Mesolithic microlith barb of honey coloured flint dating to between c8000 amd c4000 BC. These finds are probably residual or invasive do not form part of this treasure case.\n\n\n\nAlso from the field but 40m away is a palstave axe previously found in 1990 now in Lancaster City Museum. The deposition appears to have been in the side of a large burnt mound around 10m in diameter. On the other side of the canal, a socketed axe is also on the database and a palstave 200m away on the same side of the canal as the deposition.\n\n\n\nThe metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).\n\n\n\nThe copper alloy artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases, dating to between 1100-800BC (Needham et al 1997). It is intended to attempt to ascertain radiocarbon dates for the deposition of the hoard and undertake an investigation into the find spot.\n\n\n\n​\n\n\n\n1. Copper alloy socketed axe\n\n\n\nThe axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, very chipped and jagged, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in recent and ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 28mm, internal length 32mm, external width 39mm, external length 42mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).\n\n\n\nA moulded collar decorates the axe 8mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 31mm in length. The ribs are worn. The front and back faces of the axe are very slightly faceted at the socket end.\n\n\n\nAlong the centre of each side of the axe is a pronounced casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 14mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.\n\n\n\nThe axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125).\n\n\n\nAxes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).\n\n\n\nLength: 83mm, Width: 50mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 181.06g.\n\n\n\n2. Copper alloy socketed axe\n\n\n\nThe axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is crescentic, chipped and jagged in the centre although the rest of the blade is in good condition. The cutting edge measures 58mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe socket has a square mouth (internal width 26mm, internal length 26mm, external width 38mm, external length 38mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).\n\n\n\nA moulded collar decorates the axe 22mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are two fluted ridges measuring 54mm in length.\n\n\n\nAlong the sides of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have not been filed down and are off centre to the left. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 14mm in width and 22mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam does not run over the side loop. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nThe axe closely resembles the Type Portree, variant Alford as identified by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, 188-190 and Plates 75 and 76).\n\n\n\nLength: 90mm. Width: 59mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 260.64g.\n\n\n\n3. Complete copper alloy spearhead\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.\n\n\n\nLength: 152mm. Width: 44mm. Thickness socket: 24mm and the weight: 131.28g.\n\n\n\n4. Cast copper alloy socketed axe complete and in good condition.\n\n\n\nThe axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, chipped and jagged at the corners, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 25mm, internal length 28mm, external width 37mm, external length 40mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).\n\n\n\nA very worn moulded collar decorates the axe 15mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 32mm in length. The ribs are worn.\n\n\n\nAlong the centre of each side of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded very narrow side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.\n\n\n\nThe axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125). Axes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).\n\n\n\nA fragment of a pressed flower was discovered in the bottom of the socket presumably for attachment. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nLength: 86mm; the blade width is 50mm. Thickness socket: 26mm and the weight is 219.14g.\n\n\n\n5. Copper alloy socketed chisel or unlooped socketed axe\n\n\n\nThe socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 25mm, external width 28mm, external length 32mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).\n\n\n\nOn the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away and are almost invisible. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nThe blade is crescentic in good condition. The cutting edge measures 54mm in width and is 1.0mm thick. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (57mm wide) which appear to have been deliberately recessed.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axe is unlooped, making it highly unusual and very rare. There are no comparable axes in the corpus of axes covering northern Britain by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and neither are there comparable socketed chisels in the corpus of woodworking tools in southern England by Lee (2014). However, Eogan (2000, 215-16 and Plate 111) highlights the few examples found in Ireland with one parallel with the provenance only of \"County Armagh\" being the closest (No. U15).\n\n\n\nLength: 110mm, Width: 53mm, Thickness socket: 25mm, Weight: 152.07g\n\n\n\n6.Copper alloy spearhead\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in fine condition with blades still sharp and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.\n\n\n\nLength: 150mm. Width: 43mm; Thickness socket: 20mm and weight 130.79g.\n\n\n\n7. Complete copper alloy axe\n\n\n\nThe socketed axe is slender and faceted in form with a collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade. The mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nThe socket has a sub circular mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 24mm, external width 29mm, external length 31mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).\n\n\n\nThe mouth of the axe tapers and the loop is relatively small in a low position set well beneath the collar. Directly above the loop is a cast decorative circumferential ridge and above this on one face of the axe is a peg hole 4mm in diameter there may have been another on the other face but this area is covered with corrosion. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section.\n\n\n\nOn the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (50mm wide). The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away bur is still visible on and at the base of the side loop. The cutting edge is crescent shaped edge and regular suggesting little evidence of wear / sustained use. Apart from the groove below the collar there is no evidence of other ornamentation on the axe.\n\n\n\nInside the axe a complete pressed flower was inserted possibly a type of thistle.\n\n\n\nLength: 97mm. Width: 52mm; blade: Thickness socket: 24mm and weight 148.01g.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axe can be classified as Type Meldreth (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204-211 and Plate 82). It is closely comparable to axes found singly at Knotty Ash, Lancashire (No. 1226), Newham, Northumberland (No. 1227) and Pendle Hill, Lancashire (No. 1229).\n\n\n\n8. Copper alloy penannular bracelet\n\n\n\nThe bracelet has expanded oval-shaped terminals. The body is broken in one place. The surface has a green patina.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 60mm. Thickness: 8mm. Terminals diameter: 9mm and weight 20.33g.\n\n\n\n9. Copper alloy penannular bracelet\n\n\n\nThe penannular bracelet has two expanded oval-shaped terminals. It is in two fragments with one fragment missing that would have joined the terminal fragment to the body of the bracelet. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 54mm. Thickness: 4mm. Terminals length 5mm, width 2mm and weight 6.89g.\n\n\n\n10. Copper alloy spearhead\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 116-123 and Plates 75-77) as Group 11: Generic Type 11E Short, splayed socket.\n\n\n\nLength: 123mm. Width: 46mm; blade: Thickness socket: 23mm and weight 91.86g.\n\n\n\n11. Copper alloy annular armring\n\n\n\nThe annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. This armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 90mm. Thickness: 3mm; and weight 15.79 g.\n\n\n\n12. Copper alloy annular armring\n\n\n\nThe annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. The armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 67mm. Thickness: 3mm; and weight 13.99g.\n\n\n\n13. Copper alloy annular ring\n\n\n\nThe annular ring is circular in shape and has a lozenge-shaped cross section. There are three defined circumferential ridges running parallel around one section of the ring.\n\n\n\nThe three circumferential ridges as well as the form of the ring are comparable to the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron of Class A1 (Type Tul-na-cross) and Class B1 (Types Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg) (Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g)., or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire. Similar rings have been recorded from the Hindon hoard (PAS WILT-9439A7).\n\n\n\nThe form of the annular rings - though not the decoration - are also closely paralleled in copper alloy horse gear, most notably at Horsehope Manor, Peebleshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 146, nos. 3-9) and Monmore, Killin, Perthshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 141, no. 6).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 65mm. Thickness: 12mm; and weight 57.18g.\n\n\n\n14. Copper alloy annular ring\n\n\n\nThe annular ring is circular in shape and has a lozenge-shaped cross section. There are three defined circumferential ridges running parallel around one section of the ring.\n\n\n\nThe three circumferential ridges as well as the form of the ring are comparable to the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron of Class A1 (Type Tul-na-cross) and Class B1 (Types Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg) (Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g)., or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire. Similar rings have been recorded from the Hindon hoard (PAS WILT-9439A7).\n\n\n\nThe form of the annular rings - though not the decoration - are also closely paralleled in copper alloy horse gear, most notably at Horsehope Manor, Peebleshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 146, nos. 3-9) and Monmore, Killin, Perthshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 141, no. 6).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 63mm. Thickness:11mm; and weight 85.37g.\n\n\n\n15. Copper alloy annular armring\n\n\n\nA complete copper alloy annular armring, broken into 4 fragments post-deposition. It is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. The armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 87mm. Thickness: 4mm; and weight14.29 g.\n\n\n\n16. Complete copper alloy annular armring\n\n\n\nThe annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod as a visible attachment seam is retained, which is uneven. Small linear file marks are visible on the flattened surface near to the join, with a few smaller marks on the opposing flattened side. The armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).\n\n\n\nDiameter: 87mm. Thickness: 3mm; and weight 18.43g.\n\n\n\n17. Wood fragment, hazel nut shells and a pressed flower\n\n\n\nDiscovered within the deposition they relate to deposition containers and possibly the hafting of one of the axes or spears.\n\n\n\nLength: 52mm. Width 15mm: Thickness 6mm and the weight 2.96g.\n\n\n\nThe insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard, Suffolk (PAS SF-BDA986) is comparable to the to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park metalwork phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nWith the exception of the 2 Roman ceramic sherds, the vitrified glass and the flint microlith, which is probably of an earlier Mesolithic date, the objects listed above belong to a single deposit, dating to the Late Bronze Age (Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases c. 1100-800 BC) and, on the balance of probabilities, should be treated as a single find of more than two objects of prehistoric copper alloy. Whilst all of the individual object types have been found in northern Britain, it is the quantity and diversity of objects in the Late Bronze Age hoard from Scotforth, Lancashire makes it a distinctive and rare discovery. The insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. It is however extremely rare, if not unique, to discover inserted pressed flowers. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in other hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard is comparable to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nConsequently, these finds qualify as Treasure under the 2002 Amendment to the Treasure Act of 1996 (Category 2), which stipulates that any group of two or more metallic objects of any composition of any prehistoric date that come from the same find and found after 1 January 2003, qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nDavis, R. 2015.
