It has a wide convex cutting edge and a narrower convex butt end. The two side edges connecting these&nbsp;are longitudinally concave and flaring but transversally convex. Viewed from either of the side edges&nbsp;the axehead is lentoid: thickest in the middle and tapering convexly to a point at the cutting and butt ends. It is virtually complete, with two small but noticeable deformations at the cutting edge and another at the butt end, most probably caused&nbsp;by&nbsp;impact. \n\nBoth faces have a similar cast-in decoration or texture resembling wrinkles or fibres, which are very broadly linear, oriented along the longitudinal axis. They appear at six millimetres from the butt edge and continue up to ten millimetres before the cutting edge, spanning the full width of each face and spreading outwards as the width of the axehead expands. The side edges are not decorated. c. 2350-1500 BC\n\nLength: 88.0mm. Width: 58.3mm. Thickness: 10.0mm.
