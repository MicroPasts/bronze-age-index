The object can be classified as fitting into the Ewart Park phase of metalwork. The object has been broken and just the tip, including the deepest part of the socket survives.\n\n\n\nThe object is sub-rectangular in plan with the cutting edge flaring outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is almost complete but is very abraded. It measures 41mm in width, and is 1.4mm thick. At the incomplete socket end the object measures 34.8mm in width and is 12.1mm thick. The remaining socket is 2.5mm deep. The edges of the socket are broken irregularly.\n\n\n\nPatches of a glossy dark brown patina remain on each face however the majority of the surface is pitted and abraded due to movement within the plough soil. Some small patches of light green corrosion are present.\n\n\n\nSocketed axes are most common during the Ewart park phase of metal work which corresponds with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC. This would date the axe from about 1000 - 800 BC. However socketed axes were also known during the Wilburton phase of metalwork and due to the incompleteness of this example an earlier date cannot be ruled out.\n\n\n\nThe axe fragment is 25.7mm long and weighs 37.4g.
