The object has a prominent rounded midrib, which narrows at the narrower end. Although there is damage and erosion to both sides, there is the suggestion that the object was originally wider one end and is also thicker on the narrowest side (with a maximum thickness of 7.7mm and thickness on the opposite end of 7.2mm). There is a suggestion of slight curvature on the fragment, possibly indicating the implement was bent prior to breaking. The fragment has a pale green surface patina with blackened areas, indicating burning.\n\n\nThe small fragmentary nature of the artefact makes any identification   speculative, but the shape and form are consistent with a shoulder to   hilt fragment from a Late Bronze Age sword. It is possible that the   peripheral damage to one side may have incorporated a rivet hole.","fourFigureLat":"51.482315","fourFigureLon":"-1.612575","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 18, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aldbourne","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2009.232i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"26.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
