The mouth has external dimensions of 44.0 x 37.6mm and has the four casting runner stubs visible. The socket has an oval profile at the mouth with internal dimensions of 30 x 26.5mm and is 58.4mm deep. The axe has a single mouth moulding, which tapers to the face. The loop springs from the base of the moulding. The casting flashes are prominent on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The axe body has a more rounded form than is usual for the type with a sub-rectangular section of 37mm width below the loop. Both faces are decorated with three, widely spaced converging weak ribs. The blade is recurved, producing a rounded blade edge with a length of 45.5mm. The axe has a green to brown patina and has recently been coated in a varnish.","fourFigureLat":"51.491894","fourFigureLon":"-3.45619","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"This axe possesses a combination of features typically of two well-established axe types. Stylistically this axe shares many properties with Yorkshire-type axes, which are defined by widely-spaced ribs descending from a fairly prominent, slightly everted collar, and often have a small, stumpy appearance with an expanded blade edge (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 223). However, ribs on Yorkshire type axes typically run parallel or slightly diverge; no examples could be found in Schmidt and Burgess's corpus of Yorkshire axes possessing converging ribs. Similarly, the rounded socket is unusual. Furthermore, the four runner casting technology is a feature found solely in the production of South Wales axes. South Wales axes often have prominent casting seams, as seen on the Penllyn axe, and converging ribs, though these are typically not as widely-spaced.\n\n\n\nThis axe is thus best seen as a hybrid of two axe-making traditions. In form it most closely parallels Yorkshire axes, but it was produced using South Wales production methods and incorporates features of this latter axe type. These axes were in contemporary production in different regions and thus it is not inconceivably that the technologies might permeate into other areas. Yorkshire-type socketed axes have been found alongside South Wales axes in the hoards from Llantilio Crossenny 2, Monmouthshire (NMGW-AFDAE8), Tal y garn 2, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt and Lodwick 2003), and Llangwm, Monmouthsire (Lodwick and Gwilt 2001). The hoards from Tal y garn and Llangwm also contain South Wales variants, which combine features seen on other axes, while a Croxton-type axe from the Llantilio Crossenny 1 hoard possesses affinities with the Yorkshire type.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/DSCN2701.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"72.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
