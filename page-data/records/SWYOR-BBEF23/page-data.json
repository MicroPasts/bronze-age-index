It would have originally tapered off to a thinner butt. The blade is significantly flared, however the shape of the side flanges cannot be determined due to the break. It measures 68.59mm x 58.76mm x 13.65mm, weighing 174.91g. The axe seems to fall into class IV of Needham's chronology. It may possibly belong to the Arreton group; dating from circa 1700-1500BC (S. Needham, 2004, unpublished), though with only the blade to work from it is difficult to assign a confident date. The surface of the axe is green, pitted and corroded, with a glossy patina surviving in a few places. The break is also patinated.","fourFigureLat":"53.559409","fourFigureLon":"-1.775028","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Ward","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.65","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Holme Valley","county":"Kirklees","district":"Kirklees","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 880 axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"68.59"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
