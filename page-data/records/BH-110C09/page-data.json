The larger fragment comprising roughly a quarter of the upper shaft is broadly trapezoidal in plan and wedge-shaped in profile. The axe has a double mouth moulding which is very worn. The surviving body of the axe is broadly rectangular with gently tapering sides. On one face there is a semi-circular shaped loop with an oval perforation infilled with deposition residue. The fragment is broken along the upper casting seam but unevenly along the other sections of the body. The fragment measures 40mm in length, a maximum of 26mm in width at the socket end and is 5.5mm thick. It weighs 27.80 grams.\n\n\n\nThe smaller fragment is a broken section of the axe's sub-square shaped socketed body. The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan and broadly rectangular in section, and is angled at one end. The small fragment does not attatch in any obvious way to the larger fragment but the material and composition indicate that they are both from the same object. The fragment measures 25mm in length, 20mm in width and a maximum of 5.5mm in thickness. The fragment weighs 14.08 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.65926267","fourFigureLon":"-1.09062348","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"June 15, 2018","datefound2":"June 15, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"2","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chalgrove","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH110C09.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
