Probably Metalwork Stage IX, Needham Period 5; Taunton metalwork assemblage. The axe is complete. It has high triangular flanges which form a diamond when viewed from the side. It has just a slight thickening in place of a stop ridge and only a hint of a shield pattern on the haft end of the blade, on both faces. The blade is splayed but the tips of the cutting edge are damaged. There is a slight facet along the cutting edge on both faces. There is no visible decoration. The axe has a smooth brown patina with some pitting, and patches of green lumpy corrosion, particularly at the butt end which is damaged. The sides are parallel. The axe is 153mm long, 62mm wide and 43mm thick. 467g. Winged axes are more common in Northern England in the Taunton Metalwork assemblage.
