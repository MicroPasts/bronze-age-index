The axehead is flat on both faces, and both faces show signs of re-sharpening at the blade end. One face has a scar running roughly diagonally across the axehead; this may be a casting mark, or possibly occurs due to later damage. The blade is crescentic in shape. In profile, the butt end of the axe is rectangular with rounded edges. It is not clear if there is a break at the butt end (now worn very smooth), however it is likely that the original overall length was at least a little longer in order for it to be attached securely to a handle. Overall length: 52mm; cutting blade length: 50mm; butt end length: 26mm; butt end thickness: 8mm. The axehead can be approximately dated between 2150 BC to 1500 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.661273","fourFigureLon":"-3.699172","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Danielle Wootton","datefound1":"May 24, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Danielle Wootton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bridford","county":"Devon","district":"Teignbridge","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwootton/Keith Wells flat axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
