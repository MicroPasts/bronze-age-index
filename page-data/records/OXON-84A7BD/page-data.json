It is circular and formed by two coils of an oval cross-sectioned metal wire; both ends taper and flatten slightly. The patina is corroded in patches of dark and pale green. The outside surface is very abraded and heavily pitted, while the inside of the ring is smoother.\n\n\n\nIt is difficult or impossible to tell Bronze Age from Iron Age from Roman spiral finger-rings. It is possible that earlier examples of prehistoric finger-rings may have more turns around the finger and be thicker than later examples. It is therefore a possibility that this finger-ring can be dated to the Bronze Age period.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects has been recorded on the PAS database as HAMP-7556B3, SF-4497E7 and SF-761FF6 , see also examples of spiral finger-rings in the Near Lewes hoard (SUSS-C5D042) and the Ockham hoard (SUR-B41DB6), both Middle Bronze Age in date.\n\n\n\nDiameter: 29.37 mm, Thickness: 2.5mm, Weight: 3.4g.","fourFigureLat":"51.64345412","fourFigureLon":"-1.43778401","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"180","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"29.3","edge":null,"thickness":"2.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lyford","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bertie123/OXON84A7BDSpiralRing.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
