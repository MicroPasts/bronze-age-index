The knife or dirk would have been triangular in shape. Traces of rivet holes are present at the top of the top fragment. A median rib is present on both fragments. Blade facets are present along the edge but the original edges have been damaged. The middle section has been decorated by stippling. The break between the fragments is patinated, indicating that it was broken prior to deposition.\n\n\n\nThe upper fragment measures 50.1 mm in length, 34.4 mm wide and 4.2 mm thick. The blade edges are 2.2 mm thick. It weighs 25.3 g. \n\nThe lower fragment measures 70.3 mm in length, 23.6 mm wide and 5.1 mm thick. The blade edges are 2.0 mm thick. The point is 6.7 mm wide. It weighs 25.1 g.\n\nTogether they weigh 50.4 g.\n\n\n\nBoth fragments are a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.","fourFigureLat":"52.92976981","fourFigureLon":"-2.38822964","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"September 18, 2021","datefound2":"September 18, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"2","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Loggerheads","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Newcastle-under-Lyme","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID891FAC_combined.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
