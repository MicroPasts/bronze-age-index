The head of the pin is globular with a hollow terminal that could have held a stone. The edge of the hollow appears to possibly have been crimped so as to enable it to be compressed and thus hold the stone in place. The head has a diameter of 8.49mm, whilst the diameter of the shaft immediately beneath it is 5.15mm. This increases to 5.67mm over a distance of 10.63mm, after which there is a central swelling decorated with alternating grooves and ridges (11 grooves, 10 ridges) that run circumferentially around the swelling, with a maximum diameter of 7.14mm in the centre of the swelling. This then tapers to 4.99mm before the break. There is the remnant of a loop that would have protruded from the shaft. The object has a Verdigris patina.\n\n&quot;Sally Worrell (PAS adviser) says that these pins &quot;Represent a valuable addition to the small dataset found in Britain and elsewhere in the north European Plain. These pins are mostly, but not always decorated and may be perforated or looped or neither and share common features such as the shape of the head, the swelling of the neck and decoration in the form of incised linear motifs. They occur within the &#39;Ornament horizon&#39; phase of the late Taunton or early Penard phase of the later mid Bronze Age, approximately 1400-1250 BC&quot;.&quot;\n- Byard, A (2009) BERK-2E4E35: A BRONZE AGE PIN Web page available at: https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/254946 [Accessed: 11 Oct 2022 12:33:27].","fourFigureLat":"53.61986799","fourFigureLon":"-1.20022324","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"May 01, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Malcolm Adams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"7.14","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norton","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/madams/WAW555009.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"43.07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
