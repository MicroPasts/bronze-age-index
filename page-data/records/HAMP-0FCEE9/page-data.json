It comprises a crumpled strip of sheet or ribbon gold around 63.7mm in length, decorated with around 10 parallel ridges running along its length across one side; the reverse is undecorated. There is a partial tear across the mid section, probably from post depositional damage. The object has a rounded terminal with a ragged pierced oval hole. The other end of the object tapers into a narrow square-sectioned hook which curves under the plate and ends up 2mm wide. The surface of this terminal is smooth and undecorated, with the ridged decoration stopping short of it.  \n\n\n\nLength: 63.7mm; Width: 9.8mm; Thickness: 0.3mm; Weight: 3.5g.","fourFigureLat":"51.26626234","fourFigureLon":"-1.54272791","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-800","notes":"This appears to be a flattened item of personal adornment, originally secured in a loop using the hook and piercing and perhaps used as an earring, or finger ring. The presence of these features places this example into a less common group of Bronze Age ribbon gold artefacts found with fittings. Eogan (1994) has categorised these objects as ‘Tress’-rings, including them in his discussion of gold working in the mid to late Bronze Age. More generally, there are a range of comparable ribbon gold ornaments known from the duration of the Bronze Age, particularly from the 'ornament horizon' of the Taunton and Penard phases of the Middle Bronze Age (Roberts 2007).  This object also however finds parallels in its form within the earlier Bronze Age sheet gold tradition and an excavated example found in Oxford in a sealed alluvial deposit along with a Beaker period flint scraper and pottery (Palmer 1980) suggests that an early Bronze Age date for this type of artefact is entirely possible. A number of similar objects have been reported as potential Treasure and are recorded on the PAS database, including HAMP-B9814B (2018T700), SUR-DE6DF2 (2017T644) and BH-1BE953 (2014T901).","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"July 30, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tangley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMP0FCEE9.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"63.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
