The axe is complete, except for the broken side loop, and in good condition. The body of the palstave is narrow but splays down the blade eventually flaring at the blade edge which is wide. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which may well have been hammered. The butt is squared, tapering with narrow flanges on both sides. The broken side loop is adjacent to the stop ridge. The length is 183mm, the width of blade is 90mm, width of butt is 22mm thickness 40mm and the weight too heavy for scales. There is a median thin rib from the stop ridge to the blade facet that flares into a fan shape. Similar to NLM-EE77E7, LEIC-6799A2. Similar to Read (1995: p.3 fig 3) dated 1450 - 1250BC.\n\n\n\nType Silsden side-looped palstaves are commonly found in the northern Britain and are especially widespread in Yorkshire. The closest comparable hoard is the Silsden hoard, Yorkshire which also contained two palstaves. (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 616, no. 923-4). The two Type Silsden side-looped palstaves can be dated to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 161). They are classified within the broader 'Late Palstave' type but are typologically close to 'Transitional Palstaves' such as Type Shelf (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160).\n\n\n\nSchmidt P. and Burgess C. 1981, The axes of Scotland and Northern England Prahistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX.
