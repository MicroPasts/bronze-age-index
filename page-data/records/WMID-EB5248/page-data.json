The fragment is sub rectangular in plan, and triangular in section. The socket is rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along both of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at the sides. Possible filemarks are present on the front and back of the axehead.\n\n\nThe socketed axehead fragment measures 33.83 mm in length, 52.77 mm wide (at the blade), 41.23 mm wide (at the body), 19.62 mm thick (at the body), 3.46 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 15.13 mm deep. It weighs 67.3 g.\n\n\nThe socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.\n\n\nPeter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) comments that it is late BA rather than Middle - as in post Wilburton - Llyn Fawr phase (1150-750 BC).  Almost all socketed axes are from the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC). It looks as if it comes from a narrow bladed axe - something like a Yorkshire or Meldrith type - but there is just not enough to say one way or the other (definitely not a Swales Axe).","fourFigureLat":"52.77750833","fourFigureLon":"-2.13485881","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"November 01, 2006","datefound2":"November 30, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.62","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hyde Lea","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-EB5248.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"33.83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
