The break is ancient and possibly cut - the section is very smooth at this point, although the metal does appear to hava been treated, which may account for this.\n\nThe fragment is 56.5mm long and weighs 15.51g. At the break it is 17mm wide (although one edge is worn) and 8mm thick at the mid-rib. At the point, which is worn, it is 3mm wide and 2.5mm thick.\n\nThe rib becomes less pronounced c.10mm from the tip, where the blade becomes more lozengiform in section. At the break, the rib is very pronounced, with a slight depression flanking either side.\n\nIn shape, the spearhead is triangular and the edges bevelled. One edge is particularly worn. The patina is mostly intact and shiny brown, except on the edges and mid-rib.","fourFigureLat":"52.53782543","fourFigureLon":"-0.11418288","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"August 20, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittlesey","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"Fenland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/CambsSpearView2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society","length":"56.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
