The remaining portion is a short length of the socket with a tapered U-shaped blade. The socket is oval in cross section with projecting ridges running down each side which are the remains of casting flashes. The object tapers in width and thickness from its socket to a rounded cutting/gouging edge which is concave on one of its surfaces. The gouging edge has worn well rounded chips at its tip. The casting lines are visible for the whole length of the object on both sides. The surface is greyish green, indicating a probable high tin alloy.\n\nDate: Bronze Age - corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7, and dated to c. 950 - 750BC\n\nDimensions: 56.08 mm x c18.45 mm x 17.45 mm\n\nWeight: 21.49 g\n\n\n\nComparable socketed gouges have been recorded on the PAS database. For examples see: SOM-D46055, YORYM-316F81, YORYM-CD7FFB, SWYOR-FCB525, NMGW-62C84F, DUR-06F0E8, IOW-EC25A7 and SUR-7898C5.\n\n\n\nIn database record SOM-D46055 Ed Caswell comments: The missing mouth makes typological identification difficult, Savory (1980, p 55) suggests that the earliest socketed gouges such as those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings, whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68). This gouge is most likely of Ewart Park metalworking, phases which correspond to Needham's (1996) Period 7","fourFigureLat":"50.89844543","fourFigureLon":"-2.08668912","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.45","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tarrant Hinton","county":"Dorset","district":"North Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucybev/DORD8B5CD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"56.08"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
