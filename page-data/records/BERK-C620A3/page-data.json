The object is flat copper-alloy rod with a rectangular cross section. One end tapers to a rounded point. The other end flares to a flanged chisel end. The cross section is unusual for a chisel of the Bronze Age, which are usually lentoid in section. Apart from the general shape the object is rather undiagnostic and a general date of Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age is suggested. Along the length of the object are small, circular depressions which might be the result of shaping the object.","fourFigureLat":"51.53965988","fourFigureLon":"-0.79020479","fromdate":"-1750","todate":"43","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Smither","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Smither","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bisham","county":"Windsor and Maidenhead","district":"Windsor and Maidenhead","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERKC620A3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"87.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
