Both long sides taper gradually towards a rounded terminal which is now hooked over. The corners of the  opposite end are both bent over and flattened. Multiple transverse ridges suggest that the ribbon has been folded multiply at some point in its life and then rolled flat again. No ornament is present.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 44.84mm; width 11.12mm; weight 1.83g.\n\n\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken by the Science department at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 89-92% gold, 7-10% silver, the rest being copper.","fourFigureLat":"51.26589508","fourFigureLon":"-1.45673378","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"It is difficult to identify this fragment as a particular object type, although it may belong to a range of ribbon or strip ornaments of Bronze Age date. Several precedents and parallels are available, for instance see Treasure case 2013 T674 (from Oxfordshire), and reference and comparanda there within.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This object is more than 300 years old and is composed of more than 10% precious metal. It therefore should be considered Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"June 28, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Mary Bourne","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF9134.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"44.84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
