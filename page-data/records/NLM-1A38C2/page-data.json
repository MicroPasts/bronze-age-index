Cast butt and ridges or flanges - more on one side than on the other, giving a partial I-section - from the end of a palstave axe, of comparable form to others from the locality (e.g. NLM-EE9650 and NLM-EE77E7) which are described as Type Silsden side-looped palstaves. The end of the butt is rounded, presumably by wear. The surface where this object was detached from the rest of the axe is rough and shows the pale green signs of recent corrosion. This probably represents a recent break.
