The object consists of part of the open socket and one loop and part of the body of the probable axe. There is a casting seam visible that runs through and beyond the centre of the looped handle. The head-end of the object is flaring slightly, which is why it is assumed that this object represents a miniature axehead rather and any other type of tool. The patina and condition of this object suggests a Bronze Age date and although miniature objects were being made into the Roman period, full-sized axe heads of this type are known from the later Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.7565422","fourFigureLon":"-0.90032521","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aston Sandford","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013927.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"25.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
