It consists of a metal rod, rectangular in cross section, with a wedge shaped, round ended, terminal at one end, and a pointed end at the other. The rod tapers towards each end.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 44.4mm in length; c 5mm x c 4mm across the section. It weighs 3.42g.\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to date such a non-diagnostic item, and although it might possibly be Bronze Age in date (as may be suggested by the patina) it could equally be later. cf.
