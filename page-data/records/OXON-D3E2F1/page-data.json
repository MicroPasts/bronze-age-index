The spearhead has a short but slender kite-shaped blade with rounded shoulders. The edges are bevelled but are now damaged and blunt. The socket is circular and tapers from the open mouth into the shaft between the blade's wings. There are two lozenge-shaped drilled 'loops' located between the socket mouth and the blade. Both of the spear wings have corrosion adhering to them, one side more so than the other. This is strongly indicative of deposition in a watery or saturated context. Slithers of what appears to be carbonised wood is visible in the socket.\n\n\n\nThe spear is 155.8mm long, 40.9mm wide, the blade is 14.9mm thick, the socket has a diameter of 18.9mm. The spear weighs 125.2 grams.\n\n\n\nSide-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis'  (1909) Class IV which they date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Davis (2012) has recently provided a more thorough typology of Bronze Age spearheads in Britain in which he dates side looped forms to The Acton Park Phase (1550-1400 cal BC) (Davis 2012: 108) with the suggestion that in some areas this use may be extended slightly into the Taunton Phase (Davis 2012: 108) (1400-1250 cal BC) their exact position in these periods being dependent on the form of the blade. This spear blade most closely fits his Class 6b (Davis 2012: 82) including Nos.309, 311 and 313..\n\n\n\n\n\nThis portion of the spear being missing a date of c. 1550 to 1400 cal BC is most appropriate (following Needham et al. 1997).","fourFigureLat":"51.69625418","fourFigureLon":"-1.23456981","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"November 25, 2018","datefound2":"November 25, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"18.9","edge":null,"thickness":"14.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sandford-on-Thames","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXOND3E2F1_new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"155.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
