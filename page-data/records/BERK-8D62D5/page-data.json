Socketed looped axehead with a single sub-rectangular mouth moulding and a additional collar moulding below. There are three raised moulded ribs on either side. Ewart Park tradition (Burgess Metalworking phase XII). This corresponds to Needhamâ€™s (1996) Period 7 circa 950-750 CAL. BC. There is a fairly even mid-green patina all over and a small break on the blade, but is otherwise complete. There is also a small crack running from the socket along one side but this could be modern damage. Poor casting but that the axe is finished and the majority of the casting flashes are trimmed and hammered flat.\n\n\n\nLength: 89.6mm. Width: 46.1mm. Thick: 36.6mm.
