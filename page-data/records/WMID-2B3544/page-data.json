The axehead is complete but has suffered from considerable abrasion and  the blade is no longer sharp. The axehead is sub-triangular in plan and  lozenge shaped in profile, with a thickness of 8.62 mm thick in the  centre, tapering down to 2.95 mm at the blade end and 2.5 mm at the  butt. The axe flares gradually from 10.3 mm wide at the butt to 80.65 mm  at the widest point, just before the edge of the blade. It measures 168.5 mm in length and weighs 374.8 grams. The surface is pitted through abrasion and corrosion and has a predominantly pale brown patina with areas of green where the surface patina has been damaged. \n\n\nBronze Age flat axes are amongst the earliest types of metal artefacts recovered in Britain, and are the earliest form of metal axes used.","fourFigureLat":"52.768417","fourFigureLon":"-1.793943","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"July 02, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.62","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Yoxall","county":"Staffordshire","district":"East Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-2B3544.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"168.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
