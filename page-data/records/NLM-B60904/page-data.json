About half of a cast round-section ring, slightly flattened buy hammering on its upper and lower surfaces. One end is broken, the other flat, apparently as made, suggesting this to be a fragment of an originally penannular object. The object is too small and thick to qualify as a member of the common class of harness rings or brooches, and is possibly a fragment of a Prehistoric object, such as a penannular base metal ring, or the base metal core of a ring of precious metal (though if the latter, no trace of precious metal remains).
