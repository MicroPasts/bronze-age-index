The fragment is sub-oval in section and rectangular in plan. The fragment appears to represent the mid-section of a small rapier or dagger. The remains of the section appear to be slightly wider at one end than the opposite, thus representing a section further up towards the hilt. The cutting edges are chipped and worn. There is a central mid-rib apparent on both faces of the blade. The object has a brownish-green patina and shows signs of corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe overall dimensions are as follows: 65.11mm in length, 22.12mm in width, 4.97mm in thickness and 21.65g in weight.","fourFigureLat":"52.38182525","fourFigureLon":"-2.2217963","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford","datefound1":"September 28, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.97","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Offmore and Comberton","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wyre Forest","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sburford/bronzeagedagger.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"65.11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
