It measures 26.32x(max)10.87mm and weighs 7.21g. Its internal depth is 13.72mm. The object is cone-shaped, its walls c.2.3mm in thickness. The walls are heavily pitted and have two apertures, one 5.3mm long and the other 1.1mm in diameter. They are likely to be the result of a casting fault caused by the metal not properly filling the mould leaving the ferrule possibly unfinished (Kevin Leahy pers.comm. February 2014). It is impossible to determine the original length of the object but the jagged open end is very worn. The closed end is c.4mm in diameter.\n\n\n\nA similar ferrule can be found on the database; GLO-428CF4","fourFigureLat":"51.2125222","fourFigureLon":"-1.6005255","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Eleana Vandyk","datefound1":"January 01, 2014","datefound2":"January 31, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Eleana Vandyk","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"10.87","edge":null,"thickness":"10.87","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kimpton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ellysg1/HAMP-A36D91Ferrule.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"26.32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
