May also date to the Roman period if it is not a casting jet, therefore a wider date is given from 950 BC to AD 410. \n\n\n\nThe object is broadly rectangular in plan. The upper edge is flat and the underside has a 'U' shaped concave recess. Two circular-sectioned runners project from the upper edge of the object. The runners protrude beyond th eedges of the main body. The object has a mid-green patina with an abraded and pitted surface with areas of active corrosion.\n\n\n\nCasting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below. An alternative suggestion by Dot Boughton is a very worn object with tubular fitting or socket. \n\n\n\nThe object measures 41.54 mm in length, 26.90 mm in width, 18.98 mm in thickness and weighs 23.7 grams.","fourFigureLat":"53.28766282","fourFigureLon":"-4.64177522","fromdate":"-950","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Victoria Allnatt","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.98","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Trearddur","county":"Isle of Anglesey","district":"Isle of Anglesey","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/vallnatt/WMIDEFB938.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"41.54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
