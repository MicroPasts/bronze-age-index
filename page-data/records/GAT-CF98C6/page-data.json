Bandon axes are distinguished by their small size, a rectangular, slightly tapering parallel sided body, convex sides developing into low hammered side flanges, a faintly defined proto stop ridge and a sharp lower body flare expanding into a deep crescentic blade with pointed blade tips. This specimen corresponds in most of the listed attributes but differs in the following manner. A very faint outline of a stop ridge can be discerned on one face but, most importantly, the side flanges were formed on this same single face. The obverse face is featureless and therefore defeats the object of creating an efficient hafting facility on the axe. In this capacity the specimen may be considered as an unfinished object which leads to the question why it was discarded rather than being recycled. Although not analysed the most likely composition of the axe is bronze. The object was discovered during metal detecting by an employee of the landowner and the context of burial is therefore not known.\n\n\n\nIn the Welsh corpus of Developed axes there are nine Bandon and Bandon affiliated examples from Wales with four representatives from northern Wales, respectively Crug (Bethel), Caerwys (Flintshire), Overton, (Wrexham) and Rhuallt (Denbigh). The Crug axe, the nearest geographically to Llanfaglan, is closely similar but has an extended body and is characterised by panelling on the face a feature unique to this axe. The closest parallels to the Llanfaglan axe are two axes from south Wales, namely the small, slightly damaged example from Llanfabon (Nelson - Caerphilly) and the example from Penllyn near Bridgend, one of a small group which appear to be associated with the location of a former lake.\n\n\n\nThe dimensions of the axe are - length 81.23mm; blade width 48.60mm; butt width 21.87mm; maximum body thickness 11.97mm, weight 151.6 gms.\n\n\n\nDeveloped flat axes belong to metalworking assemblage IV, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 3 and can probably be dated to the interval between circa 2000 and 1750BC.
