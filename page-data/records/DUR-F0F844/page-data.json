The parallel sides are relatively straight, expanding towards a curved shaped blade that has a width of 32.04mm.The sides have been slightly flattened to enable the blade to be fixed to a wooden shaft. Both ends have been worked to produce a sharp cutting surface. The surafce of the metal is slightly corroded and pitted with a dull pale brown patina with some pale green patches.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and thus one of the earliest phases of metalworking in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, corresponding to Needham's (1996)  Period 1-3 c.2500-2050 cal.BC, or slightly later.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples on the PAS database have been recorded under various types, including miniature object e.g. YORYM-CE8933 (59.01 mm), flat axe e.g. KENT-CF6F79 (80.6 mm) and YORYM-D53C89, chisel e.g. SUSS-9B7F13 (65.17 mm) and flat axehead e.g. LVPL-03D15C (61.5 mm).\n\n\n\nNeedham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age , Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140","fourFigureLat":"54.65514818","fourFigureLon":"-1.52102916","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-2050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Des Murphy","datefound1":"September 28, 2021","datefound2":"September 28, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Des Murphy","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bradbury and the Isle","county":"County Durham","district":"County Durham","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/benwestwood/DURF0F844.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"77.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
