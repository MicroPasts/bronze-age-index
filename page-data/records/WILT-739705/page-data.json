It measures 83.62mm in length and weighs 213.39g.\n\nThe axe has a faceted, short, broad and baggy body with a gentle curve at the sides extending into a flared trumpet shaped mouth at one end and expanded cutting edge at the other. Both cutting edge and mouth are of similar width, making the axehead rather symmetrical.\n\nThe mouth is circular in shape and measures c.43mm in diameter. It has a deep flaring collar which has a moulded rim at the edge. The socket is rather more oval in shape, measuring 32.8x29.61mm. It is 67mm deep.\n\nThe loop projects just beneath the flaring collar, where the body measures 37x34mm. From here, the sides drop with a very gentle curve to the expanded cutting edge, 48.97mm wide. The facets extend inwards of the edge in a deep curve, which straightens to a vertical roughly half way along the body of the axe.\n\nThe surface is extremely pitted though the patina is preserved in some areas, notably the cutting edge which has obviously had additional work in its lifetime. The casting flashes around the loop have been smoothed but area still visible, unlike the join on the other side where they are not visible. There also appear to be casting flashes around the mouth moulding (possibly an additional, thinner moulding below that of the open end) but this seems unfinished, or else obscured by pitting.\n\nThe inside of the socket shows two prominent ribs from the corresponding grooves of the core.\n\nThis axe is of a type which is known as Type Gillespie, which Burgess and Schmidt suggest is associated with later Wilburton metalworking traditions and Ewart Park tradition. It has been suggested that this form of facet axe continues production into the Llyn Fawr tradition (which is the transitional period between the metalwork of the Bronze and Iron Ages).\n\nCf.
