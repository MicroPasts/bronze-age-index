The socket is near-circular (with a diameter of 27.9mm - 28.6mm, 25.4mm internal and 110.1mm deep). There is no evidence for a lip at the mouth or decoration around the socket. The sides of the circular socket are conical, gradually converging to the tip and define a rounded midrib along the blade. Approximately midway between the mouth and the start of the blade are the sub-circular attachment holes (of 7.2mm and 7.8mm diameter), which are raised or burred on the interior of the socket. The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly fettled and mostly removed but with a discernible ridge surviving. The blade is leaf-shaped and reaches its maximum width approximately one-third of the blade length (with a length of 114mm and a maximum width of 38.3mm). The blade facets are evident and mostly survive (with a length of 4mm and a thickness of 0.6mm). There is the suggestion of some striations running along the blade facets, possibly the result of sharpening. There are striations evident inside the socket (7mm from the mouth). The surface has a dark-brown patina with some areas of pale-brown and green surface loss.\n\n\n\nThe sediment was removed from the socket in the museum and contained root material but no discernible surviving wooden shaft. A void was observed immediately above the peg holes.\n\n\n\nSpearheads of pegged type have been shown to date from Wilburton metalwork, dated from 1150BC, the majority of associated spearheads are found with Ewart Park metalwork (950 - 750BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.50123654","fourFigureLon":"-3.4276731","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"28.6","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/201471jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"159"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
