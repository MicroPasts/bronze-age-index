The relatively broad butt appears slightly damaged and is convex with rounded shoulders and has a width of 34.2mm. The sides are straight across the thickness of the axe, giving the axe a rectangular body section. Across its length, the sides are concave and slightly curved. The blade is damaged and the blade tip to blade edge only survives on one side, and suggests a moderately-expanded blade edge. There is the suggestion of a poorly-preserved blade facet, beginning 4mm from the current blade edge. The axe has a maximum thickness of 14.2mm at a point 75mm from the butt. The axe has poor surface preservation and is heavily pitted with a mid-green patina. Where the surface is damaged the axe surface has a pale green colour and has areas of purple, where the damage is deepest. Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefacts was carried out using aCamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The objects were examined whole within the specimen chamber and were analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. All the results presented are semi-quantitative. The results demonstrated that the axe is pure copper, with no other elements detected. The axe has relatively advanced features within the copper axe sequence; the relatively broad butt and the axe being thicker nearer the blade, suggests affinities to Type Dunnottar (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 31), which are some of the earliest tin-bronze axes. The axe form suggests a chronological position towards the end of copper axe types, perhaps dated to approximately 2,200 - 2,00BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.950472","fourFigureLon":"-3.456451","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Yscir","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20079.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"126.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
