The axe-head is represented by the blade and base of the socket only, none of the original surface survives. The axe blade would have been comparatively slender and has a gently curving blade edge. The sides are rounded and no remnants of casting flashes survive. Neither face shows evidence of ribs, although they may not be expected to be seen at the level of the fragment.","fourFigureLat":"51.703356","fourFigureLon":"-3.014357","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"A large variety of complete and fragmentary socketed axes were deposited as single finds and in hoards during the Ewart Park metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC). The fragmentation of blade ends broken across the internal socket aperture is a common occurrence and may have been deliberate. For instance, four socketed axe blade ends are known in the Late Bronze Age hoard from St. Nicholas, Vale of Glamorgan.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"May 31, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"New Inn","county":"Torfaen","district":"Torfaen","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1403.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"22.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
