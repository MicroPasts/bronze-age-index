The fragment is sub-rectangular, rectangular in cross-section and consists of the cutting-edge and approximately one third of the blade. The cutting-edge is angular and narrow, with one damaged corner. The sides of the axe are triangular, tapering towards the cutting-edge, with visible casting seams present on both sides. The break is uneven on both faces and the lower portion of the socket is visible at the break, consisting of a narrow, sub-rectangular hollow.\n\n\n\nIt measures 33.8 mm in length. 35.6 mm wide, 15.4 mm thick and weighs 64.6 g.\n\n\n\nDue to the fragmentary nature of this object, it is very difficult to confidently assign a Type of socketed axe.","fourFigureLat":"51.26789682","fourFigureLon":"0.47847318","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Chestnutt","datefound1":"December 13, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Chestnutt","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Heath","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cchestnutt/KENTECBAFE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"33.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
