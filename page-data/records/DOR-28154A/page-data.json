The butt is narrow and rounded and measures 22mm in width and is 3.4mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than cast flanges .The expanded blade measures 43.64mm in width and is 2.4mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe axe is in good condition although there is some damage to the blade. The object has a green patina and the surface is slightly pitted. A small area of the original cutting surface survives on the central part of the blade but there is some damage towards the peripheries of the cutting edge. The sides of the axe are raised, with distinct but very low flanges extending from the base of the blade to near the butt. There is no evidence of casting seams which would indicate that the axehead has been reworked after casting to produce the raised flanges.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 96.19mm in length, 43.64mm in width (at the blade) is 11.4mm thick and weighs 131.04g.\n\n\n\nIn HESH-3AFE67 Peter Reavill comments that the axehead is best described as coming from the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 420, 423and 413). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.","fourFigureLat":"50.8157883","fourFigureLon":"-2.64012903","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sarah Kelman","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rampisham","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sarahk/28154A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"96.19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
