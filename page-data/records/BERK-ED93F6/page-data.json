The fragment consists of only the very tip of the spear, and although the tip is sharp the edges are very worn and the whole object appears heavily rolled (P. Reavill. pers. comm.). The spearhead has a lozenge-shaped cross section, broken towards the tip of the socket. There is the mineralised remains of a wooden object or element on one face of the spearhead; it appears that a casting flaw resulted in a hollow and that the mineralised wood is the remains of packing to keep the shaft in place. Peter Reavill, FLO for Shropshire & Herefordshire comments that the survival of the wood \"would be odd...given the [rolled] condition of the spear.\"","fourFigureLat":"51.471674","fourFigureLon":"-1.267128","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"\nThanks are extended to Peter Reavill & Dr. Esther Cameron for their help in identifying the spearhead and inclusion.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.98","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hampstead Norreys","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2011513.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"55.84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
