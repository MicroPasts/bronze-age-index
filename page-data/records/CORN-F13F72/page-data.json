Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is at the end that tapers towards the tip, as any raised area has flattened out in section. The smooth dark green patina survives better on one face of the blade than the other, which has an uneven surface of raised areas of corrosion product.\n\n\nThe lozenge-shaped section of the blade without a defined central mid-rib suggests that this might be part of a sword from the Late Wilburton or Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age, c.1140-800 BC.\n\n\nNeedham & Rohl (1998) illustrate two similar lozenge-shaped sections of Ewart Park swords on page 135, Fig.37, Nos.386-7.\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar sections from a Ewart Park and a Late Wilburton sword, from Cranborne in Dorset, on page 665, Plate 104, Nos.365-6.","fourFigureLat":"50.355174","fourFigureLon":"-4.672329","fromdate":"-1140","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"November 01, 2011","datefound2":"November 30, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Sampson","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8158.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"30"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
