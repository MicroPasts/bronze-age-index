A gold example from Gloucestershire, GLO-46CA05 (2014T358) has also been reported and the record by Kurt Adams comments: \"The gold bead is likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC) based on several close comparanda. The three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham, hoard are similar in form, size and weight to the Salthouse bead (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts (including bronze palstaves) that allow it to be dated to c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid.). The bead is also similar to those from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire and Harlow, Essex, the former from a stratified Middle Bronze Age context (Varndell 2000, 12, no.1; 2005/6, 17, 270, no.6), and Buriton, Hampshire (HAMP-72E451).\n\n\n\nMiddle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. forthcoming) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).\"","fourFigureLat":"51.24464032","fourFigureLon":"-0.96988184","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Heather Beeton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Heather Beeton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.34","edge":null,"thickness":"5.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Odiham","county":"Hampshire","district":"Hart","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/heatherbeeton/LVPL09555C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
