The entire axehead is 135mm in length, with a maximum width across the flanges measuring 35.2mm.  \n\nThe blade has a mid-ridge in very low relief, and the blade expands very slightly out from the centre of the head, with the blade tips expanding out from the rest of the blade very dramatically.  The edge is cresent shaped.  In length, the blade is 67.02mm, and 113.24mm thick at its base and 1.04mm thick at the edge.\n\nThe flanges expand from the top and bottom of the septum in a sub-triangular fashion, peaking nearer to the blade than the butt.  In length, each flange measures 55.3mm and is 13.24mm wide from the septum to outer edge.\n\nThe septum is 8.5mm thick, 62.79mm long from the base of the blade to the butt, and 25.08mm in height/breadth.  The butt is slightly rounded with visible casting marks.\n\nThe object has an even green patina.","fourFigureLat":"54.197965","fourFigureLon":"-0.545289","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"July 31, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.24","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wykeham","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Scarborough","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/Collinson palstave axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of Antiquities of the University and Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne","length":"135"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
