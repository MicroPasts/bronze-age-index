Cast lunate cutting edge from a socketed axe; the hollow socketed form is confirmed by a rectangular cavity measuring 28.5mm by 9mm revealed by its breakage behind the edge of the blade. The fracture surface is rough and pale green compared to the patinated external surface features which may indicate a fairly recent break. The marked inswing where the blade narrows to join the middle part of the axe (lost) contrasts with the form of other socketed axes reported from the vicinity, where the body widens only slightly before meeting the blade (e.g. NLM-6ABEB8) .
