The shoulders are eroded but appear to have been comparatively broad (with a surviving width of 48.2mm) and is better preserved on one side. The original form of the hilt is now uncertain although it may have been of trapezoidal form with differential corrosion to the apex of the butt, which now has convergent sides. There are no definite rivet holes evident but there is a notch at the central apex, which may have aided the hafting or attachment. The butt is thinned (with a thickness at the apex of 0.6mm) and may have been reworked. Below the shoulders, the sides are concave and convergent (for approximately 26mm). The blade is then near straight and convergent (for approximately 17mm with a width of 26-18mm) after which, the blade is straight and only slightly convergent before the tip. The blade is of lozenge section and gradually thickens to reach a maximum near the tip (of 4.1mm). The blade edge has been lost and is now rounded. The surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-brown to black patina and with an area of pale-green corrosion. There is no surviving evidence for a hilt mark on the surface\n\n\n\nThe corrosion makes it difficult to confidently identify the blade typologically with the scheme as outlined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981) but would seem to best fit the Group IV weapons with damaged or reworked butts. Group IV blades belong to Taunton to Penard Metalworking industry of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC.\n\n\n\n1.
