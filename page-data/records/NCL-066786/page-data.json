The lock-ring is decorated with a series of incised concentric lines. One edge of the lock-ring is broken in a ragged edge, the other follows a neat line that may represent the original edge or a cut mark. The lock-ring is in a moderate condition, with cuts and distortion across its faces. There is evidence of tubing holding the two faces together (this has lifted in one section to reveal this construction technique). Around 1 quarter of the object is now missing and it is unclear from the initial inspection whether the small gold fragments form part of the broken edge or whether they are remains of other elements within the lock-ring construction. More investigation of this piece is required. \n\nDimensions: Weight 2.62g; Diameter: 29.6mm\n\nScientific Analysis\n\nAnalysis was carried out by the Department of Scientific Research at The British Museum. \n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis indicated a surface composition of approximately 80-82% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being copper. \n\nDiscussion\n\nThis Late Bronze Age gold &lsquo;lock-ring&rsquo; dates to the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC). Lock-rings are known in relatively small numbers from Ireland, Britain and western France (Eogan 1969). A small number of examples are known from the North of England and the South of Scotland (see Eogan 1994, figure 41). Most of the finest examples have been found in Ireland. The find from &lsquo;Near Errington&rsquo; is a fine example of its kind and, despite its moderate condition, deserves to be acquired and studied in further detail. \n\nConclusion\n\nDue to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","fourFigureLat":"55.04249122","fourFigureLon":"-2.06412989","fromdate":"1000","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"","datefound1":"January 27, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Andrew Agate","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"29.62","edge":null,"thickness":"2.86","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wall","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/andyagate/DDS_0017_1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Tyne and Wear Museums","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
