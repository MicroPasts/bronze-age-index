The blade is lentoid in section and sub-rectangular in shape, flaring outwards nearer the blade edge. The blade edge is now missing.\n\n\n\nThe stop-ridge is rectangular in shape, though the depression in one face is deeper than the other. The butt portion of the axe is also missing.\n\n\n\nThe thickest portion of the item is the junction between blade and stop-ridge where flanges rise to meet at the centre.\n\n\n\nThe surface is very worn and the axe appears to be heavily damaged. The patina is a dark green and dark brown mottled colour, with iron staining on the blade portion.\n\n\n\nDimensions: weight: 177.73g, length: 99mm, width: 38mm, thickness: 18mm","fourFigureLat":"51.88585181","fourFigureLon":"0.97739227","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sophie Flynn","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sophie Flynn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Elmstead","county":"Essex","district":"Tendring","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/slflynn/ESS17C46C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"99"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
