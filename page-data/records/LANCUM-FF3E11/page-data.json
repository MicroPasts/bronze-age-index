The axe is a heavy implement for its size and complete with the two flanges and a crescent-shaped blade with up-turned corners. It is part of the Taunton metalwork assemblage. The axe has two triangular flanges (diamond-shaped from the side). The casting flashes are visible and have been filed but are still slightly raised and with its small, worn semi-circular stop-ridge it could be related to the shield-pattern palstaves of the Acton Park metalwork assemblage to which it bears some resemblance. It has a dull brown patina. The axe blade is bevelled and appears to have been re-sharpened. The patina is a dull blackish-green. A similar, less complete palstave was recorded here: LANCUM-F8B182. The length is 158mm, the width is 72mm, thickness 50mm and the weight too heavy for scales.","fourFigureLat":"53.62862536","fourFigureLon":"-2.8331336","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"May 31, 2017","datefound2":"May 31, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"50","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pendleton","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMFF3E11.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"158"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
