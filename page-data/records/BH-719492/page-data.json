The ring is in the shape of a oval-sectioned loop which tapers slightly towards the terminals. One terminal has a shallow rectangular shaped recess in the centre of its face. The obect is otherwise plain and undecorated. The ring measures 17mm in diameter, while the bar itself is a maximum of 4.5mm in thickness. The ring weighs 9.68 grams\n\n\n\nSuch objects are often termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al. 2008; O'Connor et al. 2008). Their function is uncertain but they may have been personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange' (Mark Lodwick and Mary Davis in record NMGW-04216C / 2013 TW13; references therein).","fourFigureLat":"51.94489934","fourFigureLon":"-0.85207885","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"Due to this object being of prehistoric, Bronze Age date, the presence of any precious metal would qualify this item as Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.
