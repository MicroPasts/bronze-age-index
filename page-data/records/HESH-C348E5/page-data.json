The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade. The hollow socket is near complete with a small area of relatively modern damage at the base. Two single cast ‘string’ side loops  are present, one on either edge. The spearhead measures 102.5mm length, has a maximum width (across base of socket) 15.5mm and maximum thickness of 15.4mm (across same place). The depth of the socket is 75.9mm. The spearhead weighs 30.21 grams. \n\nThe tip of the spearhead is complete however the side blades have been much abraded in the soil, loosing most of their shape and also the cutting edges. However, the overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The surviving width of the blade is 14.8mm. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib, which projects further on one face than the other. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear and is best described as being conical in shape. At the mouth of the socket it has a diameter of 15.5mm and a thickness of 1.5mm. The base of the socket is feathered by abrasion. The central raised line of the mid-rib does not extend into the socket as a decorative feature. Positioned approximately 1/3 of the length of the socket parallel with the blade are two oval shaped string loops. The loop has a maximum length of 10.4mm, width 2.6mm, and thickness of 1mm. The internal diameter of the loop measures 4.2mm x 2mm. The cross section is lentoid. Both loops are filled to some extent with an orange corrosion product, probably an iron pan, due to the burial conditions. These loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams on either edge of the spear have trimmed and hammered flat. \n\nThe spearhead is a mid-brown green colour with an even but much corroded patina. The patina has been abraded in several areas and there are several areas with an unstable surface. Some of these unstable surfaces have been caused by corrosion, which has caused the metal to laminate slightly. There are a number of concreated areas of iron staining, probably due to burial conditions. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket. \n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham’s Period 5 (c. 1500 – 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Peter Reavill","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wem Rural","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-C348E5_5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"102.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
