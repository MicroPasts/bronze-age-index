The ring is a Late Bronze Age example that has a triangular cross section. It is hollow and was constructed around a now lost organic core (possibly wood or wax: see La Niece and Cartwright 2009). The ring has flat terminals and is decorated on both outer facing surfaces with incised striations. These decorative lines are set at angles to one another in a triangular pattern.\n\n\n\nDimensions:\n\nWidth: 4.55 mm\n\nThickness: 5.56 mm\n\nWeight: 2.97 g\n\nDiameter: 20.65 mm\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nLock-rings are Late Bronze Age ornaments made from gold plates, secured together by a binding strips to create a hollow and incomplete ring. The three gold plates, technically termed face plates, are sometimes decorated with repouss√© decoration or with fine concentric incised lines imitating fine wire work. More infrequently, lock-rings are made from face plates formed or constructed from individual gold wires fused together or from striped twisted gold wires soldered together (Murgia et al. 2014). The Hambledon lock-ring is an example of solid face plates decorated with incised decoration. These are relatively rare. Eogan (1969) recorded only three examples (Ibid., fig.4, nos. 39-40, 43) and only two of these (both found between Haverhill and Saffron Walden in Essex) carry decoration that closely resembles the Hambledon find: interlocking chevrons.\n\n\n\nA similar example of a triangular cross sectioned lock-ring can be found in ESS-5ECCA2 as well as three examples from LANCUM-C98FBF and two from LVPL-5DFE32.\n\n\n\nLock-rings are known across Britain, Ireland and North-West France (see Eogan 1994, fig. 41). The find is therefore consistent with the known distribution pattern.","fourFigureLat":"50.93967503","fourFigureLon":"-1.06203026","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"As this object is more than 10% precious metal and is probably over 300 years old, The ring will fall under the Treasure Act of 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Edwin Wood","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20.65","edge":null,"thickness":"5.56","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hambledon","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/PenRingSUSS5EA230.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
