The form most likely corresponds to Davis' (2017) group 11, probably a product of the Wilburton or Ewart Park Metalwork Assemblages and dating to c.1200- 800 BC. The socket is incomplete, but what remains is a maximum 23.7mm diameter and tapers seamlessly into a thick round midrib. The blade is leaf shaped and tapers regularly to a thin triangular point. The cross section is lenticular with no clear distinction between midrib and wing. There is a remnant of a narrow flange around the blade edge on one side at the widest point suggesting a stepped or bevelled blade edge which has mostly been lost to corrosion. Much of the original surface is retained; there is no trace of decoration apparent.","fourFigureLat":"51.13941002","fourFigureLon":"-2.65888987","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"23.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Pennard","county":"Somerset","district":"Mendip","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR9CD5A3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"184"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
