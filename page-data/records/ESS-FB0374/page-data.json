Is an early palstave of ‘Group I: Primary Shield Pattern’ type, probably dated to the Middle Bronze Age.  All parts of the palstave are present and include a probable bar stop and a shield-shaped depression on the blade just below the stop.  The shield is transfixed by a long central ridge running from it to the cutting edge, this forms a primitive version of the ‘trident’ pattern.  The palstave also has roughly parallel sides above the stop and a widely splayed blade.  The cutting edge and blade tips are worn but intact.  The palstave has a mid to dark green patina but is slightly abraded with light green exposed areas.  There is also some slight gouging to the blade.  There is no casting seam.  It measures 138.9mm long and is 54.28mm wide (from tip to tip).  Palstaves of this type can be found in Schmidt, P. and Burgess, C. 1981. The Axes of Scotland and Northern England, pages 117-125, ref. 770-787A.","fourFigureLat":"51.992949","fourFigureLon":"0.634863","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"Found during a metal detecting rally on 2nd April 2006.
