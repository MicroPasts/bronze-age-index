It is sub-rectangular in plan with a slightly curved blade. The sides, adjacent to the cutting edge, taper inwards towards the break. In section the fragment is sub-triangular. The fragment measures 51mm width, 26mm length, and is 11mm thick. It weighs 46.24 grams. \n\n\n      The cutting edge of the axe fragment, although corroded and slightly abraded by the soil, is worn and shows areas of possible sharpening and hammering. The break at the top is old. It is also corroded and abraded, however, a shallow partial elipsical / sub-oval hollow is visible. This is probably the base of the socket. The patination on the majority of this axe fragment is a mid-green colour. However, there are a number of patches of light green powdery (active) corrosion present.","fourFigureLat":"52.118952","fourFigureLon":"-2.746267","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"February 09, 2004","datefound2":"January 01, 2003","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wellington","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/axe frag.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
