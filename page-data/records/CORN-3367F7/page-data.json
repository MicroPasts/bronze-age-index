Beyond these protrusions there are on either side about 10 mm of the base of the blade in the form of a slight ridge. The blades would have been leaf-shaped and bevelled. The ferrule has a long hollow socket which is circular in section and tapers towards the broken blade end. The opposite end of the socket is also damaged but the surface of the ferrule is in good condition, having a rich green shiny patina.\n\nSimilar examples can be found in Pearce (1983) from Lynton in Devon on page 448, Plate 34, No.270, and from Pimperne in Dorset on page 478, Plate 54, No.430b. The latter was found with a side-looped palstave. These types of spear-head are generally dated to the Penard phase (c.1300-1150 BC), as is an example from Maentwog, Gwynedd in Pearce (1984) page 38, Plate 10, which was found in a hoard with flat-ribbed rapiers.\n\nNeedham (1998) also illustrates a similar but complete example in his group of Penard metalwork on page 132, Fig.34, No.188.","fourFigureLat":"51.22064139","fourFigureLon":"-2.60277345","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"August 07, 1998","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"26.5","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Cuthbert Out","county":"Somerset","district":"Mendip","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Powellfinds 101.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"122"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
