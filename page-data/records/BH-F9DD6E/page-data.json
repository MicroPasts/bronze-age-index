The fragment is a small part of the head and pointed, now worn and rounded, tip. It is lozenge-form in cross-section with a pronounced midrib extending longitudinally along the central axis of the body. The blades either side thin towards the worn rounded edges, and all of these, as well as the tip and broken lower edge, are damaged and abraded. There are some areas of lamination across the surfaces that have light-green patination but otherwise the rest of the surfaces are mid-green in colour.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 37.2mm in length, a maximum of 13.8mm in width and 6.5mm in thickness, and weighs 8.55 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.65425724","fourFigureLon":"-0.58477423","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"January 01, 2019","datefound2":"November 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Amersham","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Chiltern","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BHF9DD6E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"37.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
