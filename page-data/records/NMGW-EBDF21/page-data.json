The tang is pointed at its apex ad below is square to rectangular sectioned, with straight sides gradually diverging towards the blade (reaching a maximum thickness of 5.6mm at the top of the blade, where the gouge has a width of 9.8mm). The sides of the blade are also straight and diverge more markedly to the blade edge. There are no lugs or mouldings on the sides. The blade edge is straight (with a width of 23.4mm and, a depth of 4.2mm). The flute gradually both deepens and widens along the blade (with a length of 37mm). The surface is heavily-corroded and is stripped to the red-brown metal with traces of pale to dark-green patina. \n\n\n\nMetallurgical analysis was conducted on the gouge using X-Ray Fluorescence and suggested that the metal composition is largely copper. \n\n\n\nThe gouge is of an unusual form and cannot easily be paralleled in Bronze Age metalwork. Gouges generally are of socketed form and date to the Late Bronze Age. Very few tanged gouges are recorded, with one of the few instances in the Carlton Rode (Norwich) hoard[1] of Ewart Park metalworking, although the examples are of significantly different form, being slender and collared. Tanged chisels are easier to parallel and also date to the Late Bronze Age but also generally have a collar or side lugs. Simple ‘chisels’ of similar form have been recovered, including the ‘axe-chisel’ from Llandyfan (Anglesey) associated with an Early Bronze Age Food Vessel urn (Savory 1980, no. 334)[2]. The suggested copper composition would be very unusual for Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts and if Bronze Age, a Late Bronze Age date may be expected for the gouge. Therefore it is perhaps unlikely that the gouge dates to the Bronze Age but cannot be discounted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] NHER Number: 1002\n\n\n\n[2] Savory, H.; 1980; A Guide Collection of the Bronze Age Collections; National Museum of Wales","fourFigureLat":"51.98453178","fourFigureLon":"-4.98675713","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fishguard and Goodwick","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/gougenew.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"86.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
