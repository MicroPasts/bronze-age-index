Altogether there are 10 of these celts.  The measurements do not vary more than 1 or 2mm. 6 of them are so similar in detail (and flaws) that they are obviously from the same mould.  The other 4 are slightly smaller (23mm edge 73mm long and 20mm socket) and moreover have a second ridge near the haft as indicated in sketch. These 4 are from one mould. The dotted lines show the necessary adjustment for the four smaller celts.","fourFigureLat":"NA","fourFigureLon":"NA","fromdate":null,"todate":null,"notes":null,"materialTerm":null,"identifier":null,"datefound1":null,"datefound2":null,"subsequentActionTerm":null,"recorder":null,"gridSource":null,"quantity":"NA","height":null,"diameter":null,"edge":"25","thickness":"20","discoveryContext":"","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":null,"country":"","patina":"","surface":"","other":"Site: unspecified location in Scandinavia - geolocation not accurate to 10 kms,Width: edge 25mm; socket 20mm,Thickness: socket 20mm,Weight: 85.05 gms","composition":"","associations":"","publications":"","inputBy":"Joellen McGann","imageURL":"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/13306367025_4ba6b102fa_b.jpg","flickrURL":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/MicroPasts/13306367025","project":"drawB8","rightCorner":"","collection":"Liverpool Museum,88.72.88,purchased with Scandinavian Flint Specimens","site":"scandinavia?","toSearch":"Sweden","gridRef":"","dateDiscoveryDay":"NA","dateDiscoveryMonth":"NA","dateDiscoveryYear":"NA","remarks":"","museumCollection":"Liverpool Museum","museumID":"88.72.88","collectionIdentifier":"","stolenStatus":"","imageCopyrightHolder":null,"length":"75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
