The butt of the axe has been broken off in antiquity. There is some evidence that the axe was deliberately damaged; the profile has been slightly bent at the butt end, implying considerable force, and there are linear marks on both butt end surfaces aligned at right angles to the axis of the blade. These would appear to be deliberate blows from a narrow bladed implement, such as another axe. The blade edge is extremely eroded and the axe surface is heavily pock marked, having a green patina, with patches of lighter green carbonate deposit. This may be identified as a bronze flat axe of the Type Migdale/Class 3 belonging to period 2 of the Early Bronze Age (circa 2300 - 2050 cal BC) in Britain (Needham 1983; 1996; Schmidt & Burgess 1981). These are the earliest bronze axes of Britain, which were in use at the same time as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Parallels for this axe, within the National Collection are examples from Usk, Monmouthshire and Whitchurch, Pembrokeshire (Savory 1980, Cat Nos. 106 & 107).","fourFigureLat":"51.516584","fourFigureLon":"-3.629929","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2050","notes":"Flat axes are usually found as single finds and separate from settlement and burials of this time. As a consequence, it proves very difficult to date them because of the lack of associations with other material culture and human activity. At present, less than 100 flat axes have been recorded from Wales, spanning a time period from 1500-1900 BC. Therefore each single new find adds significantly to the picture of early metal use here (Gwilt 1999). The probable evidence of deliberate breakage of this axe is interesting, suggesting either breakage prior to recycling and re-smelting or deliberate breakage as part of a ritual involving the burial of the axe within the ground. It is unlikely that a modern plough would have caused such focussed and directional damage to the axe. It is probable that this axe was cast and made in Britain; axes of this shape may be found all over Wales, Scotland and England. In Wales, Bronze Age copper mines have been located and excavated on Anglesey, at the Great Orme, near Llandudno and on Copa Hill Cwmystwyth in mid Wales. However, the earliest radiocarbon dated activity at the Welsh mines belongs to the middle of the Early Bronze Age (circa 1900cal BC), which is after the currency of the Type Migdale flat axe. The earliest copper mining evidence from Northern Europe comes from Ross Island in County Kerry in Western Ireland, with mining occurring between 2500 - 2150BC. However these mines probably supplied ore to make the earliest copper axe types, which are particularly common in Ireland, yet rare in Britain. A mould for making flat axes has been found at Betws-y-Coed, Conwy, showing the technology did exist for flat axe production and casting in Wales, even if the metal source remains speculative.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"December 01, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cefn Cribwr","county":"Bridgend","district":"Bridgend","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
