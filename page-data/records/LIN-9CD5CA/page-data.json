The sides are bowed. It is trapezoidal and wedge-shaped in cross-section with a flaring cutting edge and narrowed shaft. The sides descend from the butt almost vertically then expand in a smooth curve to produce a cutting edge. \n\n\n\nLength: 28.54 mm; Width: 14.08 mm; Thickness: 3.81 mm; Weight: 4.97g\n\n\n\nDiminutive axes are often associated with Roman votive offerings. However, the axe recorded here is clearly of a Bronze Age form. Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are becoming established. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function. Other examples of diminutive axes can be seen in Needham (unpublished; figures 77, 82 and 91). Other examples can also be seen in Needham 1988, 'Selective deposition in the British Early Bronze Age', World Archaeology, volume 20, number 2, figure 4. These all illustrate the range in size and form of Bronze Age diminutive axes, enhancing the possibility that this object is in fact of Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"53.14779383","fourFigureLon":"-0.02774891","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lisa Brundle","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lisa Brundle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.81","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"East Kirkby","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lisabrundle/LIN9CD5CA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28.54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
