The chape is sub triangular or ogival in shape, and lozenge shaped in cross section. At the open end the chape curves upwards into two convex arms, creating a crescent shape. The outside edges curve down gradually to half way down the chape, before narrowing at a more steep angle. The chape terminates with a rounded knop, at the end of which is a circular hole and rivet to attach the knop. Running down the centre of the chape on both sides is a raised ridge, this slopes gradually down to the edge of the chape, this is raised round the outside edge of the object. On both sides at half-length there is a circular perforation to the right of the raised central ridge. The inside of the chape is hollow. The chape has a light green patina, with patches of brown and bronze showing through. It measures 85.2mm in length, 40.9mm in width, 14.4mm in thickness, and weighs 48.02g.\n\n\n\nSimilar scabbard chapes can be seen in Savory 1980, page 185, figure 37, number 56. These chapes are part of the Guilsfield hoard, and have been dated to the late Bronze Age.
