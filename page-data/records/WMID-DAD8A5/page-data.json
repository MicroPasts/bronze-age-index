The septum (length: 50.1mm) is much shorter than the blade (83.4mm), with a stop dividing the two.  The flange stops are very low, with a height of approximately 3-4mm.  There is a midrib clearly down the centre of the blade's length on one side, with an indication of a worn midrib on the other side.  The blade tip and cutting edge are no longer visible due to corrosion and wear.  The flat side flanges extend from the butt to the blade edge, which seems to be a common appearance in what Rowlands classifies as a Class 2 type.  Medial ribs on the blade face are also a more common feature of this type (M J Rowlands, 'The Organisation of Middle Bronze Age Metalworking: Part I: Discussion', 1976, page 30).  The artefact is in a worn but fair condition.\n\nA similar example is illustrated in Rowland's publication (Plate 29, Ref no 650), and was found at Bardon Hill, Leicestershire.\n\nThis artefact was identified and recorded by Philip J Wise at Warwickshire Museum on 25/07/1991, who noted that is was the first prehistoric find from the Dunchurch area.  Additionally, he mentioned a similar palstave was recorded from Stechford, Birmingham, dating between 1400-1000 BC (the Middle Bronze Age).","fourFigureLat":"52.33508","fourFigureLon":"-1.31165","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"July 16, 1991","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dunchurch","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-DAD8A5  3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"138"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
