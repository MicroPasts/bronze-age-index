The blade portion of the axe remains with the broken edge traversing the axe and revealing the tip of the socket. The blade cutting edge is asymmetrical, rounded and blunt, and is convex in plan. The blade has slightly flared sides, and on these side faces the casting seams are still evident. The break edge of the axe is not recent as there are traces of a patina on the break that matches the traces of dark green patina on the surface of the axe. The surface of the axe is abraded with only traces of a well developed patina. From the cutting edge to the broken edge the axe measures 32.08mm, and from the corner of the blade to the broken edge it measures 57.91mm, across the broken edge it measures 15.92mm thick. It weighs 96.1g.\n\n\nThe axe is a socketed axe dating to the late Bronze Age, c.1150 to 700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.570332","fourFigureLon":"-2.340782","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.92","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Worfield","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-BAFA74.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"57.91"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
