The edges of the blade are lost. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a distinct bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is sub circular in shape and positioned toward one side of the section.\n\n\n\nAt the break the socket has an internal diameter of 6.00mm and the sockets depth is 12.17mm. The blade (sides) of the spearhead is incomplete having been heavily abraded in the burial environment. This damage has resulted in the loss of shape to the blade and the blunting / loss of the tip. The spear blades cutting edges have been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by an expanding (tip to base) lozenge sectioned shaped midrib. This midrib originally expanded into the socket of the spear. The central line of the mid-rib extends to break and is more distinct on one face. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a dark brown to mid green colour with an even but much corroded patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface and patina. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead fragment measures 65.57mm length, has a maximum width of 23.74mm and maximum thickness of 11.53mm. The spearhead weighs 33.1 grams\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above. Possibly Davis Group 6 of the developed side looped type.","fourFigureLat":"52.845319","fourFigureLon":"-2.996231","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.53","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittington","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/lvpl-b52337.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"65.57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
