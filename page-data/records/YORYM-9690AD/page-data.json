The fragment comprises a section of the upper part of the spearhead. It is trapezoidal in plan, the blade narrowing sharply towards the tip. A high rounded rib runs longitudinally down the centre of both sides. Each terminal ends in a worn break, and exhibits a lozengiform cross section with a pronounced buldge at the rib. At the lower terminal the cross section reveals the end section of the socket within the rib. A green patina is on the surface. The fragment has lost most of its diagnostic features and is therefore difficult to classify further, beyond a broad range of possible comparisons within Davis Groups 6-11.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 45.03mm in length, 27.99mm in width at its widest, 16.66mm in width at its narrowest, 11.23mm in thickness at the mid rib, and weighs 22.75g.\n\n\n\nCf. SWYOR-1F74C1 and SF-C557DC, which states that a high mid rib is more common on Middle Bronze Age spearheads.","fourFigureLat":"53.94009431","fourFigureLon":"-0.79802777","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Denise Wilding","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Denise Wilding","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.23","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Yapham","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/denisewilding/CWC0107.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"45.03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
