The long thin blade expands in width at the top to form a sub-semi-circular shape.  At the top of this are two incomplete perforations.  The rapier is bent at an obtuse angle midway down its length, the end of the blade is broken and missing.  Very similar examples are reported in the middle Bronze Age hoards found at Taunton and Penard (Rohl & Needham 1998:129, 131).    Dimensions: Length 198.5mm; width 44.01mm; width of blade: 14.92mm; thickness: 4.43mm; weight 89g  Reference: Rohl, B. and Needham, S. 1998.
