The rounded stop-ridge is well-defined and a clear individual mid-rib runs from the stop-ridge towards the cutting edge of the blade (the terminus of the rib is unclear due to surface corrosion). Both features are extant on either side of the palstave, but are heavily eroded on one face only. The butt has also suffered significant damage from corrosion.\n \nThe palstave was cast-in-one and the total length would have been c. 145-50mm. The blade is sub-oval shape in cross-section with a protrusion in the centre of each face where the mid-rib runs across the surface. \n \nThe fracture does not appear fresh, although it is unclear whether the item was found in two separate pieces or whether the break has occurred since its discovery. The surface appears to have been cleaned with an abrasive item such as wire wool, although a dark grey patina remains in places. The majority of the surface is pitted with green-tinged depressions and the palstave appears to have developed a defined waist as a result of corrosion c. 20mm from the stop-ridge.\n \nThe palstave appears to belong to the Acton Park industry, which emerged in north Wales at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. Although fine detail is difficult to discern on this item, it bears similarities to unlooped palstaves found at Holyhead Mountain, Ynys MÃ´n; Fron-hir, Llanbister, Radnorshire; and those from Acton, Denbigh.
