The blade is angular, possibly due to wear/breakage. It has a square cross-section with a raised collar at the mouth. The surface is worn and so it is not possible to tell how many ribs there were. There is a casting seam on the side where the loop is. There are also 2 casting seams visible on the inside of the axe. \n\nIt has a green/brown patina with patches of orange which may indicate there was iron buried nearby.","fourFigureLat":"52.818479","fourFigureLon":"-2.980778","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"March 09, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Felton","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fmcintosh/moulsdale socketed axe- LVPL-9285F7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Liverpool","length":"78"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
