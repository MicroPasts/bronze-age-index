These pins are mostly, but not always decorated and may be perforated or looped or neither and share common features such as the shape of the head, the swelling of the neck and decoration in the form of incised linear motifs. They occur within the 'Ornament horizon' phase of the late Taunton or early Penard phase of the later mid Bronze Age, approximately 1400-1250 BC\".","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"September 30, 2011","datefound2":"October 31, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/caht/thing.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"58.93"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
