It is sub oval in section. It appears undecorated but on one side there are two faint incised diagonal lines 7mm and 11mm from one end (the left end on the image) of the fragment. There is also a 3.5mm long horizontal incised line on the outer edge that starts at the break. The break itself is much cleaner than at the other end. There are three short horizontal scars on the inside of the bracelet. These look like they are either attempts to cut the bracelet with a chisel or where material has been removed to assist in producing the ring's curve. Probably dates to between c1600 and c800 BC.\n\n\n\nThe length is 36mm, diameter 4mm, and the weight 3.58g.","fourFigureLat":"52.80334507","fourFigureLon":"-0.44391672","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alex Whitlock","datefound1":"December 05, 2017","datefound2":"December 05, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alex Whitlock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Edenham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"South Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/AlexIdris/LANCUM701BB4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
