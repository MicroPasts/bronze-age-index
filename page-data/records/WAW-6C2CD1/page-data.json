The portion which remains is the butt which is a sub-trapezoid in plan. The terminal has rounded edges, whereas the opposite edge is broken. This break is not recent has the patina covers the break. The break reveals are large void which may have weakened the object and caused it to break in use. In profile the object is triangular, tapering towards the butt. The fragment is in fair condition, but has been abraded and only has patches of a heavy dark shiny brown patina. It measures 20.65mm long, 22.24mm wide and 6.83mm thick. It weighs 11g.\n\nPhil Watson (Principal Curator, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) suggest the fragment is dated to the late Bronze Age (-1150 to -800) as the butt is particularly narrow compared to earlier examples.","fourFigureLat":"52.183383","fourFigureLon":"-1.548012","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Phil Watson","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"February 01, 2007","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.83","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Moreton Morrell","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-6C2CD1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"20.65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
