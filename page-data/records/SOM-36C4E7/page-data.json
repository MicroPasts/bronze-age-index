Only the blade edge survives intact, the remainder now missing due to old breaks. The fragment measures 8.94mm long, 30.97 wide and has a maximum thickness of 5.55m. It weighs 3.96g.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is 'D' or crescent shaped in plan with a curved cutting edge, and has a straight inner edge. In cross section this inner edge is a pointed oval. The blade edge thickens evenly either side from the cutting edge towards the main section of the axe. Internally the blade is solid at this point. The blade edge has one small chip likely to be post-depositional, the chip showing a clean break.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is light green in colour and much of its original surface is covered by dark brown well-formed patina.\n\n\n\nGiven the extent of the curve of the blade and the even thickening towards the centre in cross section, the fragment is likely to be from a Late Bronze Age (c.1150 - 800 cal BC) socketed axehead, although it is not possible to rule out that it was a Middle Bronze Age Palstave. (c.1600 - 1150 cal BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.83281208","fourFigureLon":"-1.56604031","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"September 02, 2018","datefound2":"November 05, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leafield","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elburnett/SOM36C4E7.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"8.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
