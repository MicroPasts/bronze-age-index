The fragment is triangular in plan and slightly curved in section. The edges are rounded and worn. One end is thicker than the other. It has a well developed green patina. Though it is not possible to say what object this is part of, the wear, metal and patina suggest a Bronze Age date. Though not associated, the fact that a Bronze Age spear tip was found in an adjacent field may be significant.","fourFigureLat":"54.019167","fourFigureLon":"-0.627852","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"October 02, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wetwang","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1263_BA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"23.68"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
