The spearhead has a short but slender kite-shaped blade with rounded shoulders. The edges are bevelled and the blade is still very sharp. Fine filing or polishing striations can be seen all over both sides of the blade. The socket is circular and tapers from the open mouth in to the shaft between the blade's wings. There are two lozenge-shaped, undrilled 'loops' located equidistantly between the socket mouth and the blade. The mouth of the socket has slight damage in three areas, and a small hole (a casting flaw?) can be seen below one of the 'loops'. There are fine linear filing or finishing striations all over the length and circumference of the socket. These lines have been created by filing from opposing angles which has created triangular and cross-hatched patterns. Around the 'loops' are striations that follow the shape of each lozenge and overlies the cross-hatching, showing the filing of the loops was one of the last processes to be undertaken. Overall the spearhead is in extremely good condition. It appears to have no wear on it and it is possible it was made to be a votive deposit rather than a functional item.\n\nA small number of similar spearheads with undrilled loops have recently been recorded from across Oxfordshire; from Kingston Bagpuize (BERK-5BCE29), from Cherwell (BERK-D20304), Bampton (BERK-44F126) and another example found in AD 1871 in Fyfield now in the Ashmolean Museum (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706). It would be interesting to compare these examples.\n\nThe socket diameter is 19.3mm with an internal diameter of 16.8mm.","fourFigureLat":"51.86677597","fourFigureLon":"-1.18810963","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.8","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wendlebury","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2018655.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"158"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
