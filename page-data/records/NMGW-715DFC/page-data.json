The socket is circular (with an internal diameter of 17.2mm and an external diameter of 20.2mm) and has a rounded step just above the mouth. The socket has not been completely cleaned-out (and has a current depth of 23mm) and contains bronze corrosion. The sides of the socket are near-straight and convergent towards the blade. The loops are flat topped of sub-lozenge shape (14mm long by 6mm wide), which begin 21mm from the socket mouth. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval, containing sediment (4.0-5.7mm long and 2mm high). Both sides have a ridge, running between the mouth and the loop and between the top of the loop and the base of the blade, resulting from the careful finishing of the casting seams. There appear to be decorative grooves flanking the loops.\n\n\n\nThe short blade can be described as \"kite-shaped\" (with a maximum width near its base of 23.0mm and a length of 48mm) with flat blade edges. The socket continues into the blade as a narrowing and more angular midrib. Weak blade facets are discernible but are now worn. The spearhead has been very neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is preserved with a dark green patina. Deep sharpening striations are evident beneath the patina running along both sides of the blade and onto the midrib on both faces.","fourFigureLat":"51.39301857","fourFigureLon":"-3.45304809","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"Davis (2012, 53f.) presents plain side-looped spearheads with a kite-shaped blade as his Group 4 for Britain. These are further sub-divided into two types, based on the overall size of the spearhead and the shape of the loop plates. The present examples can be classed as Type 4A due to it being over 90mm and having lozenge-shaped loop plates. Davis (2012) records 21 Type 4A spearheads, though this example is the first from a secure context in Wales. Previously, one was known from the Museum of Aberystwyth, but without any provenance. A spearhead of a similar form was found at Marbury cum Quoisley in Cheshire (PAS LVPL-69F851).\n\n\n\nA similar side-looped spearhead was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London , and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31) to 1680 - 1400BC (with 95% confidence).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantwit Major","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/20141711jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"103.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
