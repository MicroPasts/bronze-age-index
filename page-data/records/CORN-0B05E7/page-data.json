The sides of the axe were once straight but are now abraded and taper towards the narrow butt end which is worn to almost a point. The surface of the roughout has developed a dark brown patina and the sides have exposed the light green corrosion product beneath through wear and damage since deposition.\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar rough flat axes with narrow butt ends and straight sides from Birnie, Morayshire and Angus in Scotland in plate 21, nos.258-259, which are unclassified but close to Type Migdale associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition c.2200-2000 BC of the Early Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nNeedham (2017) illustrates a similar axe-like blank or ingot on page 61, no.119 which are found within the Irish flat axe corpus but are more crudely shaped ingots in the flat axe form, presumably created in an open mould but perhaps incomplete.","fourFigureLat":"50.14759941","fourFigureLon":"-5.6827182","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-2000","notes":"Material has been drilled out of the side of the axehead for analysis by the finder which was analysed by Dr Jens Andersen of Camborne School of Mines using the Scanning Electron Microscope.
