It probably can be assigned to Davis's Group 6 'Developed side looped' type (Davis 2017). It has a narrow blade measuring 45 mm in length. The tip is missing and the break is very worn and patinated suggesting it broke in antiquity. Only circa 12-15 mm of the tip appears to be missing. The blade wings are highly abraded and irregular, though much of this appears to have occurred post-deposition since the breaks are a different patina to the rest of the object. A maximum width of 7mm remains of the the blade wings. There is a hollow cylindrical socket at the blade base. The base of the socket is incomplete, and no side loops are visible.\n\n\n\nThe total length of the spearhead is 66 mm and the maximum width (from blade wing to wing) is 21 mm. The maximum thickness is 14 mm. The diameter of the socket at the base is 14 mm. The spearhead weighs 23.82g.\n\n\n\nDavis (2017) notes that \"Spearheads from the earlier MBA were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket. They date to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC.\"\n\n\n\nDavis R (2017) Later Prehistoric Finds Group Object Datasheet No.5; A Short Guide to Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads","fourFigureLat":"53.22547899","fourFigureLon":"-0.41367588","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fiskerton","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN1CDF13.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"66"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
