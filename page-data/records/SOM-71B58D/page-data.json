The internal diameter of the socket is 17.9mm. The socket appears to be filled with concreted material, possibly organic 'fossils' imbuded with copper alloy salts..\n\n\n\nThe spear's blade is leaf-shaped (a stretched oval) and has narrow incorporated loops with flat plates, with no decoration, on either side at the base of the blade. A large proportion of the spear is covered in a green and brown copper corrosion and concreted material however enough of the blade is visible to discount the presence of channels along the spear. There also appear to be no defined edge bevels although the edges are sharp. The tip of the spear is broken off about 82.2mm from the base of the blade. The edges of the blade at the break are very chipped and fragmented. The break is unworn but patinated.\n\n\n\nThe concreted material on the surfaces appears to be organic material that was adjacent to the blade when deposited and has become concreted to it with the organics becoming imbuded with metal salts and preserved as 'fossils'.\n\n\n\nLength 133.8mm, midpoint at 42.22mm from base of blade width 34.1mm, thickness 22.0. The midrib at the break at the tip end is 10.1mm thick and 6.6mm wide. The diameter of the socket mouth is between 20.3mm and 22.41. It weighs 91.58 grams.\n\n\n\nThe spear tip's poor preservation makes it difficult to precisely identify the length of the blade. If its tip was near the broken end of the spear the point of the blade's maximum width would lie between 40% and 50% of the blade as measured from its blade/socket junction. This would define the spear as a Davis type 2 (2006, 26). However, it is also possible that the blade extended further, or even became concave in form, which would change the classification of this blade to either the flame (type 3) or ogival (type 4) form respectively. The lozenge shaped midrib with its rounded corners would be consistent with these classes (Davis 2006, 33)\n\n\n\nRegardless Davis's review of the dating evidence (ibid. p.49) concluded that, Type 2 and 3 'originated in the Acton park phase, and had its main period of use in the Taunton phase' (ibid. p.50), so around c.1500-1250 cal BC. However, there is also a limited amount of evidence to suggest that a few spearheads were in use beyond this period into the late Bronze Age, perhaps passed down from generation to generation as heirlooms (ibid.).","fourFigureLat":"51.10193381","fourFigureLon":"-2.88687454","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"September 05, 2018","datefound2":"December 06, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Middlezoy","county":"Somerset","district":"Sedgemoor","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM71B58D.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"133.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
