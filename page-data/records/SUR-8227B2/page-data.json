It appears to be either a very late specimen belonging to the Penard metalwork assemblage of the late Middle Bronze Age (i.e. a transitional palstave) or, more likely, it was part of the Wilburton metalwork assemblage (earlier phase of the Late Bronze Age, i.e. a late palstave). The palstave is complete and the casting seams have been filed down. The length of the axe is 158mm and the internal length of the socket is 67mm. The width of the body below the stop ridge is 18.4mm.The palstave is complete, but has a very pitted, mottled green surface. It looks like it was cast and prepared for use as well as used and subsequently re-sharpened; there are striations towards the edge of the blade. On one side there is a number of scratches between the wings/flanges on the outer surface of the palstave. These may have come from hafting it, but as the scratches look fresh it is more likely that they were plough damage.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is probably of Type Worthing; it strongly resembles a palstave from Worthing, Sussex (Schmidt and Burgess1981, 160ff; no. 916)","fourFigureLat":"51.19797728","fourFigureLon":"-0.11215586","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1000","notes":"The axe was found c1970 by a farm worker","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"December 31, 1969","datefound2":"December 30, 1970","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.15","discoveryContext":"Agricultural or drainage work","parish":"Outwood","county":"Surrey","district":"Tandridge","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF3904.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"158"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
