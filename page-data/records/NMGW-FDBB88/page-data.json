Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase. The axe appears to have lost the majority of its original surface, and problems in identifying surface detail are further enhanced by a thick coating of glossy varnish applied by the finder. The butt is thin and rounded and both sides are slightly concave and curve outwards to the blade tips to define an expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The flange facets are comparatively low, and define thin-pointed oval.sides. A stop is now only barely discernible on one face, and is positioned approximately mid way along the axe. Blade facets are evident on both faces. No decoration is discernible on any of the faces or sides.","fourFigureLat":"51.464384","fourFigureLon":"-3.498502","fromdate":"-1950","todate":"-1700","notes":"The axe can be paralleled with a number of similar, but slightly larger axes, found near the findspot (NMGW unpublished records). Within the National Museum of Wales' collections similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750-1600 BC.\n\n\n\nClass 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain, with examples similar to the Llandow axe known from Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire (Needham 1983, Ca 8, Ca 10, Li 15/2). In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known. Several are decorated (e.g. Llanbradig, Isle of Anglesey NMGW-6152E8), but the majority are undecorated. Comparable examples have been found at Nelson, Caerphilly (NMGW-E6DCD2) and Caerwys, Flintshire (Green 1985, 275, Fig.1).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llandow","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1744.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums and Galleries of Wales","length":"73.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
