(c 1100 - 600 BC)\n\n\n\nThe blade, cutting edge and part of the body survive. The blade is a shallow crescent slightly flared from the body, the socket is rectangular, and the body walls are thin cast (1.8 mm). The side view shows a wedge-shaped profile with a casting seam. There is a blunt projecting spur on one side 55 mm from the blade; this could be an abraded stump of a loop or casting flash.\n\n\n\nThe obverse shows the beginning of three ribs, without pellets, at 47 mm from the blade. The body terminates in jagged breaks 62 mm to 69 mm from the blade.\n\n\n\nThe axehead bears some resemblance to transitional and early Iron Age axes illustrated in Fig 4, Object Datasheet 2 of the LPFG, but due to the break, the collar, loop and final form of the socket cannot be identified.\n\n\n\nOverall length is 69 mm, width at cutting edge 36 mm, 28 mm at break.
