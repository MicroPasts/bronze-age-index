Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face of the ingot is smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and coppery red areas of decay, and light green powdering which is bronze disease. The sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, plate 36, nos.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork, and an ingot fragment from Churston Ferrers, Torbay on page 457, plate 40, no.306b, which was found with a larger plano-convex ingot, no.306a.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate another similar ingot fragment from Churston Ferrers in Devon on page 79, pl.6, no.123b, which is recorded in DEV-D9F1E2 on the database.","fourFigureLat":"50.55601234","fourFigureLon":"-4.92371266","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Mitchell","datefound1":"December 06, 2015","datefound2":"December 06, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Mitchell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"30.3","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Minver Lowlands","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/July16finds003.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"68.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
