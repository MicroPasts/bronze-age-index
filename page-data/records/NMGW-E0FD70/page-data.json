Much of the blade edges are missing, particularly on one side. The blade is lenticular in section, with no bevels. The blade edges appear to taper in a convex curve to the tip.\n\n\n\nDue to the fragmentary nature of this object, it cannot be confidently assigned to an object type or metalworking phase, although the narrow width of the blade suggests that it likely formed the tip of a rapier or dirk.\n\n\n\nLength: 27.5 mm\n\n\n\nWidth: 13.3 mm\n\n\n\nThickness: 3.3 mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 4.19 g","fourFigureLat":"51.63310725","fourFigureLon":"-2.79605823","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"George Whatley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Caerwent","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/NMWPA2022211.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"27.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
