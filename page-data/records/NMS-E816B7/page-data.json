The butt is slightly concave, possibly as a result of post-depositional damage. It exhibits a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The transverse stop ridge expands on both faces and forms the widest point of the palstave. Below, on both faces is a vertical rib which extends to the central point of the upper cutting edge. The blade has expanding sides and a convex cutting edge, now heavily worn. \n\n\n\nThe palstave has a mottled dark grey patina largely obscured by green corrosion product and pitting. \n\n\n\nEarly Midribbed Palstaves belongs to the Acton Park Phase II of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. This example is similar to Group II - Early Midribbed Type Chepstow; similar to an example from Kilnoterie, Scotland (p127 cat no 794 plate 58, No. 789).\n\n\n\nSee: Schmidt, P. K. and Burgess, C.
