In plan it is almost rectangular as the blade and terminal are so worn. In the side view the flanges still protrude. \nThe patina is mostly brown due to mud but there are patches of light green which is indicative of corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"53.91634","fourFigureLon":"-1.179345","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"November 01, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Askham Richard","county":"York","district":"York","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fmcintosh/LVPL-73FD92.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Liverpool","length":"74"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
