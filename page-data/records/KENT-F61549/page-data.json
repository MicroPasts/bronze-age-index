The point is missing but it appears likely to have been pointed rather than rounded. The blade is a rough narrow triangle in plan flaring slightly towards the hilt end. There is a slightly raised mid-rib along the blades length. At the hilt end are the remains of two semi-circular or rivet holes, these have broken cross their width, one side has broken more extensively than the other. This leave the hilt end as a rectangular tab below the blade. The hilt end would likely have fitted an organic holt was attached via the two now missing rivets. It has a heavily patinated surface with some copper-alloy corrosion in progress. It remains a mottled mid-light green colour.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 68.2mm long, 22.5mm wide, 1.5mm thick (at thickest remaining) and 13g in weight.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: Due to the incomplete and worn nature of the dagger it is uncertain as to which type or metalwork phase it belongs. A number of similar copper-alloy daggers have been recorded on the PAS database: LANCUM-C6A25A, WMID-9A6CB5, DOR-065301 etc.","fourFigureLat":"51.21844927","fourFigureLon":"1.04868362","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Petham","county":"Kent","district":"Canterbury","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTF61549.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"68.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
