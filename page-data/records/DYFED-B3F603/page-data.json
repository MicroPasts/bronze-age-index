It has a sub-triangular notch missing from one corner of the cutting edge where it has broken off, suggesting use and wear and tear. There is a small depression along one of the flared edges, it is uncertain whether this due to use or an accident in the casting. It is covered in a very rough green patina which has many small nodules and bumps possibly from the casting.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"\nNo spatial data available as none received.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"","district":"","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mpage/DSC01430.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"82"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
