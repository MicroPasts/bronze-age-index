The object is in fair condition with a green patina and weighs 9.08 grams. It is sub triangular in section and its curves forming almost an S shape. It starts with a curved edge, 1mm wide, then from here it widens to 9mm. The widest surface has a raised lip at each edge which curves to form the almost S shape, between each lip the surface is formed of a semi-circular depression. At one end the two lips and the underside converge in a curved point. At  the other end the two lips converge but the object carries on. At this point the object has snapped and it has one almost straight edge and one with a shallow crescent shape.  The object is reminiscent of the leaf like protrusions on Iron age terret rings, but the metal 'looks' Bronze age.","fourFigureLat":"52.506361","fourFigureLon":"-1.397378","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"January 23, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Burton Hastings","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/DSCN0493.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
