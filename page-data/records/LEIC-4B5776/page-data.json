The blade of the palstave is broadly sub-triangular in plan with relatively straight (but with slightly expanded) sides and a expanding convex cutting edge (fantailed). In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Directly below the stop ridge on both sides is a concave depression which is divided vertically in the centre by a raised rib. The rear part of the axe, from the stop ridge to the butt, is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge, it has a central rectangular shaped septum.
