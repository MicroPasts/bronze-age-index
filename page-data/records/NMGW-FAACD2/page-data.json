The butt is rounded at the corners and the sides diverge slightly (with a width at the butt of 17mm) to the start of the flanges. The flanges begin 23mm from the butt and rise to a maximum height (of 30.3mm) before the stop. The sides are straight and parallel (with a width of 25.1mm) until the blade, where the sides are concave and divergent. The casting seams are evident on both sides and appear to be raised on the sides of the blade. The blade tips are slightly eroded (producing a blade width of 54.6mm) and the blade edge has an expanded blade edge. The septum is gently concave (with a maximum depth of 12mm, a width of 17mm and a length of 64mm). The stops are slightly rounded and there is a casting flaw between the stop and septum on one face. The stops are raised above the blade faces (with a height of 8mm and an overall depth of 29.2mm). The blade faces are decorated with a prominent and comparatively short mid-rib (33m long). The blade faces are slightly raised at the sides, suggesting short side ribs. A blade facet is discernible (13m from the blade edge). Remnant traces of the original surface survive, mostly on the septum and within the flanges with a dark green to black patina; elsewhere the surface is pitted and is pale green.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has a narrow body similar to Type Liswerry, although the flange extensions are comparatively short, similar to Type Chepstow. The dating of Group II palstaves corresponds to the ActonPark metalworking industry, equating to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1,500 - 1,150BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
