In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. There are multiple abrasions and missing portions of the edges. The fragment terminated in an old abraded transverse break. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing and the retained portions has a shallow concave aspect expose by the break.\n\n\n\nThe metal is a mid-green in colour with a pitted and corroded patina.\n\n\n\nAs this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).\n\n\n\nSimilar objects can be found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database: NLM-99D791, IOW-F3883D, SUR-BB2595\n\n\n\nLength: 46.67mm, Width: 13.02mm, Thickness: 12.44mm, Thickness (tip): 7.54mm, Weight: 9.6g","fourFigureLat":"52.09954861","fourFigureLon":"-0.26412757","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.44","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Biggleswade","county":"Central Bedfordshire","district":"Central Bedfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC8E2968.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46.67"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
