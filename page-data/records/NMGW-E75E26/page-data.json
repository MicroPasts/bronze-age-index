The axe fragment is heavily corroded, with none of the original external surface surviving. The axe has broken in antiquity, and only the bottom blade part is represented. One face has broken at the base of the socket, while the other face is present for approximately a little over half of its original length. The axe is comparatively small and slender, with the sides gently diverging to the blade. No evidence for a splayed blade survives. The more complete face exhibits the remnants of ribs, and appears to have had four (rather than three) parallel or slightly converging ribs. The casting seam may be discerned on both sides, and considering the degree of surface loss, must have been fairly prominent. The blade edge does not survive. The interior of the socket has much better surface preservation and has patches of black colouring, possibly remnants of tenorite.","fourFigureLat":"51.51057249","fourFigureLon":"-3.39914405","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Socketed axes of a variety of types are prolific in south Wales as both single and hoarded objects. South Wales axes are the most common, with over 120 examples now known. Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).\n\nSocketed axes of a variety of forms belong to the Ewart Park phase of the British Late Bronze Age (Needham 1981, 32-37). Recently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800BC cal (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"May 31, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pont-y-Clun","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn1184.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
