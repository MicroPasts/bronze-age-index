However, the complete absence of ridges or a flange, is problematic, leaving the item open to further interpretation. There is an oval depression/void within the body of the piece, at the break point. The fragment has a green/blue, smooth patina and the break is from antiquity.","fourFigureLat":"51.54441301","fourFigureLon":"-1.41016417","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"September 05, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.39","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wantage","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/DSCN6833.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"26.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
