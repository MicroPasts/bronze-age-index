The butt end is comparatively straight with some damage and thins to a blunt edge (with a width of 19.0mm and a thickness of 1.5mm). The sides are straight and slightly divergent for their short lengths to the break (with a maximum width of 24.4mm and a thickness of 4.7mm). The sides are rounded and convex across their thicknesses with the suggestion of a finished casting seam on the corroded and pitted surface. The flanges begin just below the butt and are just emerging before the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 7.2mm with a height above the septum of 1.3mm). The break occurred in antiquity. The surface has a dark-green patina with patches of pitting and corrosion. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with slender-butted Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981) from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.69725659","fourFigureLon":"-1.40818013","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fyfield and Tubney","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2015111.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"15.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
