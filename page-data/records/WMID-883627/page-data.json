The axe is in reasonable condition, although there is damage to the butt, some of which is missing, and other scuff marks on the blade and body of the axe. The palstave is fairly short and chunky with maximum dimensions of 96.86 mm long, 43.39 mm wide, 24.06 mm thick and 200.5 grams in weight. A U shaped flange is situated at the butt end of the axe, terminating in a stop ridge at the palstave's thickest point. On both sides, immediately after the stop ridge there are angled grooves which form a 'shield' or lozenge shaped central rib which continues in a subtle way down the blade of the axe after the grooves finish. The blade is slightly faceted and is crescent shaped in plan, triangular in profile. The axe has a dark grey patina with areas of green corrosion where it has been damaged, particularly on one edge, the blade and at the butt and septum, though it is pock marked with corrosion at many points.\n\n\n\nThe palstave has its closest parallel illustrated in Schmidt and Burgess (1981: pl. 61. no.833) which is a defined as a group 3 low flanged palstave dating to c. 1400-1150 cal BC. No exact parallels are illustrated by Rowlands (1976: pl. 86 hoard 73 item 5) although he considers recessed decoration similar in form to be a developed shield pattern found on Class 1 group 5 palstaves found typically in Hampshire. it is appropriate to suggest that this therefore fits within the larger developed shield pattern group within this study thought to also date to c, 1400-1150 cal BC.
