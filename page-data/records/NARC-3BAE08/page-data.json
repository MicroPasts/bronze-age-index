The object starts at a width of 17 mm and narrows to a width of 16 mm wide and so would presumably have come from a part of the blade which was fairly close to the stabbing end. The fragment has one flat surface which tapers to an edge on either side, making the item lozenge shaped in section.","fourFigureLat":"50.24407","fourFigureLon":"-4.806377","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"August 31, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-3BAE08 - blade fragment.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"18"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
