The breaks are patinated suggesting they are not recent. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded leaf-shaped blade. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge however both are incomplete. Running either side of the loops along the length of the object there is some evidence for casting seams. The spearhead has lozenge-shape cross section across the blade before rounding to create a sub-circular cross section at the socket. The spearhead measures 48.86 mm length, has a maximum width of 11.3mm. The spearhead weighs 13.28 grams. There is some organic material in the socket however it is unclear if this is related to the use of the object. \n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a string loop type, which suggests later middle Bronze Age to early late Bronze Age date. Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Acton Park II industry. Similar examples are recorded on the PAS database, see for example LVPL-68BF43 and SWYOR-CE9339.","fourFigureLat":"54.493933","fourFigureLon":"-2.3102816","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"William Pickering","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"William Pickering","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kaber","county":"Cumbria","district":"Eden","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/a8622912/DURCCF592.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"48.86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
