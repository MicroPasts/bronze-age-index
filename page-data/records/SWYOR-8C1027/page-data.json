Only the butt end and the two side loops survive intact; the remainder of the object is now missing due to old breaks. It is cylindrical in form, tapering towards the now missing blade end. On each side is an integrally cast loop that are pointed oval in form and flattened against the side of the spear perhaps as a result of post-depositional damage. The loops are 16.5mm long, 6.5mm wide and project 3.5mm from the wall of the socket. The entire object has a worn dark brown patina with patches of turquoise corrosion. The internal diameter of the socket at the the complete attachment end is 16mm. The walls are 2.2mm -2.6mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"53.52912776","fourFigureLon":"-1.08124565","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"November 22, 2012","datefound2":"November 21, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Armthorpe","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2269_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"51.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
