The break between the two pieces is probably recent and reveals a slightly purple crystalline matrix with many air bubbles. The edges of the breaks are not abraded but crisp. The butt is a slender trapezoidal with two rivet holes across the lower edge. There is a copper alloy rivet within each rivet hole. From these rivet holes the sides of the rapier expand into the shoulders of the blade. The maximum width of these shoulders is 31.03mm. From the shoulders the edge of the rapier narrows into the blade. From this point the blade itself tapers in width more gradually to almost have straight edges towards a broken edge. This break also feels fresh with crisp edges.  The blade is an elongated lozenge in cross-section with no clearly defined mid-rib or edge bevels.\n\n\n\nThe object has a matte mid-dark green-brown patina.\n\n\n\nThe length of the rapier measures 82.58mm, 31.03mm wide, 13.05mm thick at the rivets, 4.81mm thick at the blade break and together they weigh 35.3g. its maximum thickness is 6.8mm. \n\n\n\nThe object is likely a Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV (1981) and dating to the period c. 1500-c. 1150 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.34415366","fourFigureLon":"-1.32618873","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"March 31, 2019","datefound2":"June 27, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dunchurch","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW3B927C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"82.58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
