The blade edge has a nick out of one corner but is relatively complete and short typical of the type. The axehead is fairly worn but appears to be poorly finished with casting flash and seam lines still prominent along the sides. The section of the socketed axehead towards the socket is mostly missing, this appears to have occurred prior to the loop and rim of the mouth. It has a dark grey-green patination.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: The Axehead measures 56.8mm by 28.7mm by 16.1mm and weighs 82.78g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The axehead dates to the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age 950 - 750 BC and due to the straight sides the date range may also fit with Bronze - Iron Age transition period known as Llyn Fawr which extends the date range to c. 650 BC. Needham (1996) period 7-8 Metalworking stage XII - XIII.  The form roughly fits the South-Eastern types illustrated in Schmidt & Burgess (1981).","fourFigureLat":"51.19510472","fourFigureLon":"1.24755845","fromdate":"-750","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mat Honeysett","datefound1":"September 05, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mat Honeysett","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eythorne","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/PUBLIC1E42D1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"56.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
