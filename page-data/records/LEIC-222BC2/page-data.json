Only the tip survives. It is very damaged and corroded, but roughly sub-triangular in form and with a lozenge section and a wide hemispherical rib running along the centre of each face. The flattened sections to either side of this are very damaged and the tip is missing. At the other end is an irregular break with a slight dimple in the centre suggesting that the spear had a socket. There is a thick brown patina that is missing in a few places revealling a green inner core. It is likely to be of middle to late Bronze Age date (1500-800 BC) due to the socket and the lozenge section, although it lacks many key diagnostic features.\n\n\n\nLength: 35.0mm, width: 12.5mm, thickness: 6.5mm, weight: 6.91g","fourFigureLat":"52.72065744","fourFigureLon":"-1.15754429","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"December 10, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Booth","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mountsorrel","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Charnwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/annab/LEIC-222BC2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
