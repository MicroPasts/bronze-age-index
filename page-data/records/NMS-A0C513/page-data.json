It has a central narrowed constriction, undecorated and with a vertical step down to it, which is curved on the top and has a rounded hollow on the underneath, c. 5mm in diameter. The constriction measures c. 5mm in thickness and 8mm in width. To either side is a thicker, tapering, drooping element, D-shaped in cross-section although slightly rounded rather than completely flat on the underside. The strongly curved upper surface of each half is decorated with worn ridges and grooves, which continue almost to the pointed ends; just before the end, they stop and the end is a little concave. In side view the object is widely angled, with the two halves extending outwards rather than downwards and joining each other at an angle of about a hundred degrees.\n\n\n\nThe whole object is worn and detail is hard to see. It is 32mm from end to end, 9.5mm wide when viewed from the top, and measures 14mm from top to bottom when viewed from the side. It weighs 10.96g. There is little dating evidence available for these enigmatic objects. An example was found with the Salisbury Hoard, indicating a Bronze or Iron Age date; the style might suggest an Iron Age date.\n\n\n\nCompare NARC-6A4546, LVPL-B000C6, HAMP-6F4C45, PUBLIC-E9E1C5, NARC-925E14, WILT-616785, KENT-77A0BF and SF-722CF5.","fourFigureLat":"52.68711934","fourFigureLon":"0.94284499","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"40","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Geake","datefound1":"October 12, 2019","datefound2":"November 11, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Geake","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dereham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/56899_A0C513_BA_UnidentifiedObject.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
