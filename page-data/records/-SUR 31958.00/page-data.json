The spear is well preserved and has very sharp blade edges. The tip and the socket are both broken and there are the remains of one side loop. The spearhead has a sharp ridge between the blades. The socket length is 47.59mm.\n\n\n\nRichard Davis suggests that this spearhead can be identified as a Group 6 Developed Side-looped spearhead. It may be dated to the MBA - the later Acton Park and Taunton phases, and possibly the early part of the Penard phase. The lozenge shaped midrib and the prominent midrib ridge are typical of this type. There are remains of the top of the side loop at the bottom of the lower part of the socket remaining. Davis argues further that it appears that the spearhead was purposely damaged in antiquity with the tip and lower socket broken off, and the hole pierced in the lower midrib. This suggests some form of ritual destruction, possibly the weapon of a defeated opponent.
