The blade is triangular, with a pair of small loops at the junction between the lower blade edge and the socket. The root of the blade juts out at right angles from these loops. The socket is conical, continuing along the blade as a broad rib with circular cross section, with the flat blade projecting to either side. There are possibly small ribs running along the blade from the ends of the loops which are aligned with the midrib, however the condition of the object makes these very difficult to see clearly. The patina is dark, with pale patches of corrosion / encrustation typical of long exposure to a riverine environment. This spearhead is likely to date from circa 1200 to 1050 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.47793502","fourFigureLon":"-0.18702426","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1050","notes":"The style can potentially be identified as Davis Type 9c (also identifiable as Greenwell and Brewis IIIa) and is seen as an indigenous development from earlier leaf-shaped Middle Bronze Age forms which is associated with the Penard industry. This dates to the transition from the middle to late Bronze Age. This is a relatively rare tradition, with finds typically concentrated in the lower Thames Valley (Pearce, 1984: 41; Ehrenberg, 1977: 11), as with this example, which was a foreshore find from the Thames and may have originally comprised a votive deposit in the river. Similar examples from the upper Thames valley are published in Ehrenberg (1977: Fig 17) and more generally in Langmaid (1976, 52; 18a/b). This is an unusually small example of the type.\n\n\n\nRecorded from details emailed by the finder.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"February 27, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Queen's Gate","county":"Greater London Authority","district":"Kensington and Chelsea","regionName":"London","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURCB84D2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"106.35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
