It is broken in 3 pieces. The handle is socketed, consisting of a tube with a hollow be-conical pommel, the apex of which is pierced by a hole. This hole, which appears to be the result of a fracture, may indicate the position of a loop to hold a ring for suspension. The middle portion of the handle is missing, but it is suggested that the 4 hollow bronze rings were once suspended from it, as in the well known example from Dunaverney Bog.","fourFigureLat":"50.637345","fourFigureLon":"-2.284178","fromdate":null,"todate":null,"notes":null,"materialTerm":null,"identifier":null,"datefound1":null,"datefound2":null,"subsequentActionTerm":null,"recorder":null,"gridSource":null,"quantity":"NA","height":null,"diameter":null,"edge":"","thickness":"","discoveryContext":"farm","parish":"Winfrith Newburgh","county":"Dorset","district":"","regionName":null,"country":"England","patina":"Dull green, metal rubbed bright in places.","surface":"Smooth, generally, some rough patches, dented in places.","other":"Length: Head: 193mm; Handle: 105mm; Rings: c. 37 outer and 24 inner diameter","composition":"Bronze","associations":"Other objects in hoard, see Antiquaries Journal, supra.","publications":"Proceedings, Dorset Field Club, XXV, xxxiii,Antiquaries Journal, XV, 449 H, Fig. 1","inputBy":"Joellen McGann","imageURL":"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3855/15176818976_8ce47f6a91_b.jpg","flickrURL":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/MicroPasts/15176818976","project":"A8tools","rightCorner":"C","collection":"Dorchester Museum, 1934.12-1.A-C,Loan from the late Herbert Welsh, F.S.A., Formerly at Lulworth Castle, Dorset","site":"England,Dorset,Winfrith Newburgh,In Coome Bolton below Sleight Buildings (or Randall's Farm) 1 3/4 mile S. of Winfrith, exact site lost.,1903","toSearch":"Winfrith Newburgh, Dorchester, Dorset DT2, UK","gridRef":"SY 80 82","dateDiscoveryDay":"NA","dateDiscoveryMonth":"NA","dateDiscoveryYear":"1903","remarks":"Part of \"The Lulworth Hoard.\",1b.
