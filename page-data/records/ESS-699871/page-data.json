It is subrectangular in plan, having short, straight sides typical of the Shoebury variant of the southeast axe type. The cutting edge of the axe is missing. Instead the axe ends in a semicircular shape that is blunted and very worn. The mouth is subcircular in section, appearing quite ‘squarish’ with an internal diameter of 22.14mm. The collar is broken and the moulding beneath almost rubbed away. The loop is missing and the remaining lugs are similarly very worn down. There is no decoration on the axe. The casting seams are visible on both sides of the axe. The patina is dark green with large areas of dark brown, inside and out. The Shoebury variant is one of the most common southeast axe forms and the eponymous find from Essex (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, The axes of Scotland and Northern Britain, pages 213-214).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Paul Sealey","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Essex","district":"","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/DSCN0062.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"71.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
