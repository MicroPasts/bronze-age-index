The object is broken in two large fragments and some small pieces are missing. Other than that, it appear complete. It has a long, narrow and slightly tapered tube with transverse linear groove decoration and with a blunted point at one end, and an open dome at the opposite end. This object is in two fragments and seems to have been broken off where the tube was perforated by a slit or hole. There is another small hole on the tube just underneath the round open end. Unfortunately, even though the object is complete, we do not its function. It is very likely that it was part of ta kit of Late Bronze Age feasting equipment, i.e. may have been part of a flesh hook or flesh fork.
