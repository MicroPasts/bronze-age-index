The blade appears to have been of lozenge of kite-shaped form and has broken on one side near its base and on the other side near its widest point. The socket interior is evident at the break (with a maximum surviving depth of 114.6mm, ending 35mm from the tip) and there is also a blade edge facet discernible, suggesting the blade has broken at its start. There is no suggestion of a loop-hole, suggesting the spearhead was not of a Basal Looped type. The blade edge appears to widen with a linear edge (for 43mm, where the spearhead has a maximum surviving width of 42.5mm), the blade edge then has a near-linear convergence to the tip. The socket position is marked by the circular-sectioned midrib on the faces (with a thickness at the break of 1.0mm and a maximum depth through the midrib of 12.6mm), which gradually narrows and thins towards the tip. The blade wings thin slightly towards the edge (with a maximum thickness at the midrib of 5.0mm and a thickness before the edge facet of 3.4mm).  The stepped blade bevel or blade facet is preserved along much of the surviving blade edge (with a maximum width of 5.7mm). Some of the damage to the blade edge may be contemporary with its use but much of the edge, particularly the shorter side is more recently damaged. The surface is somewhat pitted and corroded with a dark-brown patina. Linear striations running along the blade wings are preserved beneath the patina. There is a bend just above the widest point of the blade but a loss of patina and green corrosion at the bend may suggest that the damage occurred more recently.\n\n\n\nThe absence of the socket makes typological identification uncertain and the lozenge or kite-shaped blade form is also a little unusual. The more commonly–recovered types consistent with the form of the fragmentary spearhead are pegged, of Davis’ generic Group 11 (2015)[1], or possibly of a side-looped type, Davis’ (ibid) Group 6, although the blade would seem to be too large for a Group 6 spearhead. Socketed Spearheads of Davis’ Generic Group 11 can be dated to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated by Needham et al (1996)[2] to c. 1200 – 900BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Davis, R., 2015; The Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads of Britain, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung V.
