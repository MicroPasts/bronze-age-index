Five curved thin sheets with a highly polished dark green upper surface and a light green rough corroded lower surface. Four have straight defined edges. Refitting the fragments was not possible but angle of the curvature and the location of the edges implied an original flattened dome form.\n\nMax.

Type Yorkshire socketed axes are frequently found in hoards from East Anglia to Scotland (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 223) and Type Meldreth socketed axes are well known throughout Britain, Ireland and Western Europe (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204). Nail headed pins are rarer but are found throughout England, including the northeast with comparable pins found in Heathery Burn Cave, County Durham (Britton and Longworth 1968, nos. 95-108; O'Connor 1980, 200, list 180, map 63). Bar toggles are occasionally found in hoards in England (see Rafferty 1975; O'Connor 1980, 196 and List 169) and although the Stannington example lacks the distinguishing central loop or perforation, it is possible that this is due to the breakage on the rectangular protrusion.\n\nThe probable cauldron handle fragment is comparable in shape and dimensions to the two cauldron handles placed in a hoard with a two blade fragments and 11 socketed axes, including one of Type Yorkshire, at Kilkerran, Ayrshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, plate 147 and p. 225-226, no. 1383; for further discussion of Late Bronze Age cauldrons, buckets and their handles see Gerloff 2010). The probable phalara fragments are interpreted, as are the bar toggles, as horse gear and are found throughout England and beyond (O'Connor 1975; 1980, 197, list 171.) with two from the northeast at Heathery Burn cave and Eastgate, Co. Durham (O'Connor 1975, 220). The final object, a probable wagon fitting, has no straightforward parallel in Britain or beyond but is broadly comparable to sections of Late Bronze Age tubular wagon fittings found in the Hart a. d. Alz group in Central Europe (see Pare 1992, 18-42). Despite the relative rarity of certain object types in the hoard, the assemblage is comparable to parts of the Heathery Burn Cave, County Durham hoard(s) (Britton and Longworth 1968) and Kilkerran, Ayrshire hoard (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 225-226) amongst others.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe hoard fulfils the requirements for being considered Treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act (2002 Amendment).\n\nReferences\n\nBritton, D. and Longworth, I. 1968 Late Bronze Age finds in the Heathery Burn cave, Co.
