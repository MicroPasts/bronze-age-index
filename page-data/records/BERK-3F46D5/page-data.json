The object is three-dimensional and consists of a pair of drooping ovoid elements with pointed tips, hence 'moustache' shaped. These ovoids are decorated with multiple grooves running down the body of each ovoid but stopping before the tip. In the centre of the two drooping ovoids is a recessed band running around the waist of the object. On the underside is a rectangular hole; it appears that this hole may have continued through and perforated the top but this has been filled at some point with a small amount of copper alloy. \n\n\nThe use and date of these objects remains enigmatic. A number of these have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database, including WMID-CA9D04, BH-037A57 and SF-520513. There is some variation in these objects, some have very pronounced but slimmer ovoids with long tips, others are short and squat. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117), and as such they are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age, but without stratified examples this is unconfirmed. It is possible that these objects may have been dagger fittings, with the hole a rest for the tang, but again without any evidence this is speculation.
