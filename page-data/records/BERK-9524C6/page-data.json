The blade has a diamond-shaped cross-section and parallel-edges.  The midrib is separated from the edge bevels by a slight hollowing.  Both short edges of the fragment are breaks and the breaks have the same mid green patina as the rest of the surface suggesting the damage occurred in antiquity.  Similar blade fragments were recorded in the Petters late Bronze Age metalwork assemblage (Needham 1990:50-51).  Dimensions: length: 27.66mm; width: 14.41mm; weight: 5.63g.
