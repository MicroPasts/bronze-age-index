One of the rings is plain. The other is heavily corroded on the surfaces but appears to have ribbed decoration.\n\n\n\nThe uncorroded ring is 16.9mm in diameter, with a thickness of 5.7mm and a weight of 8.14 grans. The corroded ring is 19mm in diameter, 7mm thick and weighs 11.41 grams.\n\n\n\nThe probable Bronze Age awl is circular in section and tapers to a blunt point at one end and a rounder point at the other. The surface has a dark green patina with some small areas of fine pitting. \n\n\n\nThe awl measures 85.2mm in length, a maximum of 4.2mm in diameter and weighs 6.88 grams.\n\n\n\nAwls are difficult to date but most are probably the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as \"pointed punches\" by Coles (1963-64 117), they were presumably used for perforating leather.\n\n\n\nAs a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002). They note that although most awls are associated with leather working, some would have been used in woodworking, bone working and other crafts.","fourFigureLat":"52.03273862","fourFigureLon":"-0.0188803","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"Conclusion:  As the penannular rings are Bronze Age in date and made of gold, they qualify as treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996. Being found close to them and of similar date, it is possible that the awl is associated with them and qualifies as treasure as part of this case.\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nColes, J.M. (1964).
