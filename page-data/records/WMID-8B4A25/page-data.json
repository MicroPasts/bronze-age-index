The blade is leaf shaped (length of blade: 33mm; width and thickness: see above) with a lozenge-shaped section as well as badly corroded blade wings that protrude outwards to either side of the midrib (width of blade wings: 3.5mm). The tip of the blade is badly corroded and slightly incomplete. At approximately 50mm from the blade tip, the stumped and incomplete remains of the side loops remains to the left and right of the artefact. It is at this point that the section of the spearhead transforms from a lozenge shape to a circular socket (outer diameter of socket: see above; inner diameter of socket: 9mm). The artefact breaks immediately after the side loops begin to appear. Overall, the spearhead is in a very poor and heavily corroded condition with small areas of the dark green patina still visible.","fourFigureLat":"52.525042","fourFigureLon":"-2.443606","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"March 26, 2007","datefound2":"March 26, 2007","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"12.5","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bridgnorth","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-8B4A25.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"62.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
