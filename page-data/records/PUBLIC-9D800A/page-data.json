The axe fragment (triangular in section) consists the convex cutting edge of the object and a small portion of the sides as the edges flare inwards slightly, though the mid and upper sections of the body have been broken away in post-depositional damage which leaves only the base of the socket still extant. The object is preserved in relatively poor condition, with an uneven greenish patina interspersed with patches of brown covering most of its surfaces. It measures 52.27mm wide at the cutting edge, 39.11mm wide at its broken end, 30.95mm long and 13.11mm thick at its thickest point. It weighs 65.88 grammes.","fourFigureLat":"51.11426843","fourFigureLon":"-2.07280766","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Comparisons for this fragment can be found in Savory 1980, fig. 24, nos. 184-185 and 189, which are also dated to the Late Bronze Age","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alex Bliss as Finder","datefound1":"July 27, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alex Bliss as Finder","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stockton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/AxePUBLIC9D800A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"30.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
