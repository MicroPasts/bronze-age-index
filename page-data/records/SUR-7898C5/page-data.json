Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tilshead","county":"Surrey","district":"Guildford","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/margaretb/DSCN1827.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"70"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
