The blade of the object expands outwards to a crescentic cutting edge. The cutting edge measures 1mm thick. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the start of the flanges) is 37mm in length.\n\n\n\nAt the top of the blade below the flanges on each face of the object is an incised U-shaped groove which is probably an area of decoration typically described as shield shaped. The rear part of the axe (from the slight stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The flanges are worn and turn slightly inwards towards the septum where the handle would have been hafted.\n\n\n\nThe object has a dark black-brown patina and is heavily pitted in places with the pitting maintaining the same patina.\n\n\n\nMany short flanged axes of this type are very narrow and they are probably a specialist tool / chisel. They evolve into palstaves when the stop ridges fuse with the side flanges\n\n\n\nDimensions: 96mm in length, 16mm in width, 15mm thick, 86.1g","fourFigureLat":"52.52177586","fourFigureLon":"1.07920849","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Vanessa Oakden","datefound1":"August 17, 2016","datefound2":"August 20, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Vanessa Oakden","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wymondham","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/voakden/LVPLC78348.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
