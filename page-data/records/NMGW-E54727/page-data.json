The loop extends from beneath the moulding. Three near parallel but slightly bending longitudinal ribs extend from the underside of the mouth moulding down the blade faces.  Both external and internal socket mouth shapes are sub-rectangular.  Excess metal protrudes around the whole internal edge of the mouth, illustrating the absence of a four runner casting technology.  The sides of this axe are slightly divergent and concave, however there is minimal widening at the blade end and no recurving of the blade edge.  The axe is sub-rectangular in section with slight curvature of the edges.  Prominent casting flashes indicate the lack of axe preparation.  One blade surface is defined by a linear groove, beyind which is a bluntand unprepared cutting edge.  This appears to have been created by the mismatching of mould pieces during casting, since the opposite blade surface bevels evenly to the cutting edge.  The blade edge is flat rather than curved, also suggesting its lack of preparation for use.  Further evidence mould mismatching is provided by an assymetric casting flash down the loop of the axe. No black patination visible.  Green patina with green carbonate encrustations.","fourFigureLat":"51.47427","fourFigureLon":"-3.426831","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"59","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"99.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
