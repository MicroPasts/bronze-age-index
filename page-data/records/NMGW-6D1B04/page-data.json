The broken end does not show any evidence of a socket. The surviving blade edge is gently curved. The blade width is slender, with the sides gently expanding to the blade. The slender dimensions of the fragment suggests the piece may have come from a late palstave or socketed axe, although some of the width may have been lost through erosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.482905","fourFigureLon":"-3.455904","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0474.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"19.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
