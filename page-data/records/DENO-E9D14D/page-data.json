The axehead is broken just above the deep end of the socket. The fragment is trapezoidal in plan with a convex cutting edge, which appears complete. The object is covered with a green patina, mostly light green but with dark, shiny patches. The patina also covers the break surface, suggesting that the break is an ancient one. Apart from the break the object shows relatively little abrasion or damage.\n\n\n\nThe object is 35mm wide at the break, flaring to 46mm at the cutting edge, and 24mm in length, It is 8mm thick at the break, tapering to less than 1 mm at the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects on this database include SWYOR-BECF02 and SWYOR-7C54E2.","fourFigureLat":"52.91633463","fourFigureLon":"-0.90092487","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Nicholson","datefound1":"January 01, 2016","datefound2":"January 31, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Nicholson","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Granby","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Rushcliffe","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENOE9D14D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"24"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
