Only a portion of the blade remains.\n\n\n\nThe large fragment is from the body of the blade. It has a hexagonal shaped cross section with wide flat faces and then bevelled blades edges which have been abraded and chipped. A thick dark green patina covers the majority of the fragment although it is chipped away in places revealing a green patina below. The small fragment is the tip of the blade. It is also abraded, chipped and rounded at the end.\n\n\n\nWhile a more recent Roman or Medieval date should not be excluded the form of this fragment is consistent with many other rapier fragments recorded by the PAS including NMGW-587A08, SUR-BCF0BA and DENO-0EAF9\n\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\n\nLength: 24.6 mm\n\nWidth: 19.2 mm\n\nThickness: 2.5 mm\n\nWeight: 4.84 g\n\n\n\nPart 2:\n\n\n\nLength: 11.2mm\n\nWidth: 16.4 mm\n\nThickness: 1.5 mm\n\nWeight: 1.08 g","fourFigureLat":"51.62442395","fourFigureLon":"-1.25022451","fromdate":"1600","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Smither","datefound1":"October 24, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Smither","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Hagbourne","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK394E39.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"24.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
