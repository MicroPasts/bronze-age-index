The condition of the object makes any identification speculative. The fragment is of sub-triangular section, resembling the blade of an axe. The sides are not present and the faces are flat. The blade edge has been lost and there no surviving evidence for a socket base. The fragment has a dark green surface patina. The general shape of the bronze may suggest a Bronze Age axe blade fragment. The metallurgical composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.616577","fourFigureLon":"-4.124633","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanrhidian Higher","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.56.2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"15.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
