The axehead is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with an extended crescentic blade where the corners turn back on themselves. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The stop ridge is 4 mm thick and 20 mm wide and 62 mm from the butt end and 72 mm from the blade edge. There are thirteen oblique ridges on each side flange of the axe, which range in length up to 20 mm long and are each about 7 mm apart. There are some patches of green corrosion product but the surface of the axe has survived well and its general condition is very good. Flat axes with flanges decorated with oblique ridges and crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig. 28, no.87).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar flanged axe with flanges decorated with oblique ridges from Gavel Moss Farm in plate 33, no.402, which is classified as a Type Balbirnie long flanged axe and dated from the Arreton metalwork phase.\n\n\n\nMoore and Rowlands (1972) illustrate a similar flanged axe with ridged flanges in plate VI, no.8, which is classified as having come from the Arreton Down tradition.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples of local Arreton flanged axes with crescentic blades and expanded flanges decorated with oblique ribs are illustrated in Pearce (1983) on pages 615, 640 & 687, pl.54, 79 & 130, nos.427 & 686c.\n\n\n\nThe Arreton phase is now dated from c.1725-1500 BC (Roberts et al. 2013, p.23, fig.2.2).","fourFigureLat":"54.23305164","fourFigureLon":"-1.60263254","fromdate":"-1725","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"January 01, 1981","datefound2":"December 31, 1981","subsequentActionTerm":"In a private collection, recorded for academic use","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Well","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June16finds181.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"139"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
