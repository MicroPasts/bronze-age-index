The axe is a Schmidt and Burgess (1981, pg. 65-8; pl. 30-1) Type Bandon, Variant Swinton, e.g. nos. 347-80. The surface of the axe is corroded and worn and appears to be displaying active copper corrosion, rendering identification of the surface, and any possible decoration, impossible.\n\n\nThe axe measures 84mm in length, 34mm in width and 11mm in thickness. It weighs 78.94g. Such axes were current in the Willerby Wold phase of the early Bronze Age, currently dated circa 1900-1700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.82822309","fourFigureLon":"1.11874264","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1700","notes":"This object was reported to Dr Paul Sealey, of Colchester and Ipswich Museums, and images of the axehead were obtained by scanning the object which were supplied to the FLO for recording. As a result the record may fall below the usual standards for objects reported to the FLO. Dr Sealey states that Early Bronze Age metalwork is rare in Essex, making the find of some interest and importance; in August 2013 the object was donated to Colchester Museum Service by the finder.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Paul Sealey","datefound1":"May 22, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Katie Marsden","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Little Clacton","county":"Essex","district":"Tendring","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kmarsden/ESS-36F125.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"84"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
