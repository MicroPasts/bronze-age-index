The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n\n\nPr√§historische Bronzefunde IV, 7 Beck: Munich).\n\n\n\nThe rapiers will be discussed as rapier A and rapier B.\n\n\n\nRapier A consists of six fragments of the blade along with six rivets from the handle. One of the breaks between two of the fragments may be deliberate, the other breaks appear to have occured during deposition. All of the fragments feature substantial damage along both edges of the blade. All of the fragments exhibit one surface with a smooth dark green patina with some pitting and one surface with a heavily pitted, rough dark green patina. The uppermost section comprises widened shoulders which measure 63.47mm at their widest point. They have been damaged along the top by a series of old breaks. The edge of one notch is visible along the break line. The blade then tapers to a width of 19.82mm and terminates in a jagged break point. The blade is lozengiform in cross-section and features a thick, prominent mid-rib.\n\n\n\nThe second fargment of rapier A has straight parallel sides and is lozengiform in cross-section. The blade is slightly curved along its length and terminates in an old break which may have been deliberate. This fragment measures 129.16mm in length, 20.77mm in width, tapering to a width of 18.39mm and is 7.37mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe third fragment tapers noticably along its length 77.64mm in length, 16.92mm in width, tapering to a width of 14.24mm. It is 6.51mm thick, narrowing to a thickness of 5.91mm. The fourth fragment measures 41.00mm in length, tapers from a width of 13.07mm to 11.95mm and is 5.43mm thick. The fifth fragment measures 15.28mm in length, 11.05mm in width and is 5.15mm thick. The sixth fragment comprises the tip of the blade and narrows markedly incomparison to the other fragments. measures 46.45mm in length, tapers from a width of 11.67mm to a width of 3.98mm and narrows from a thickness of 5.19mm to 3.47mm. It terminates in an old break.\n\n\n\nThe rivets are cylindrical in shape, each featuring a ridged collar at either terminal with rounded ends. They all feature an uneven dark green and brown patina. One terminates in an old break, however, the other five are all intact, save minor surface damage. The rivets vary in length from 21.44mm to 13.34mm and in diameter from 19.21mm to 11.78mm.\n\n\n\nRapier B comprises three fragments of the blade. It is missing the hilt and shoulders. The first fragment is rectangular in shape and lozengifrom in cross section. The blade has been faceted, with a prominent mid-rib and two additional ribs flanking, creating four facets on each surface. The faceting is also visible in the cross section. The fragment measures 131.72mm in length, 23.34mm in width, tapering to 20.91mm and is 7.29mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe second fragment tapers slightly along its length. The break point at one end seems to match with the break point of the first section. One surface has a deeply pitted dark greeen patina. The other surface exhibits a smooth dark green patina interspersed with uneven patches of green and brown corrosion product and some recent scratches where the original colour of the metal is visible. It measures 135.66mm in length, 21.17mm in width, tapering to 18.66mm and is 7.11mm thick, narrowing to 6.47mm.\n\n\n\nThe third fragment comprises the tip of the blade and commences with a deliberate break, visible where the blade has been bent out of shape and snapped. Unlike the first two fragments, this fragment only exhibits one thickened ridge running along its length, rather than the faceted surfaces of the other two fragments. Both surfaces feature a pitted and scratched dark green patina. The fragment measures 156.65mm in length, 23.36mm in width, tapering to 8.98mm and is 11.86mm thick, narrowing to 8.11mm.","fourFigureLat":"50.88026826","fourFigureLon":"-2.22879757","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"These two rapiers were found at the same farm at least 10 years ago, the finder is deceased.\n\n\n\nOn the balance of probability these finds constitute a hoard but were found prior to 1st Janurary 2003 and consequently would not be defined as treasure under the 1997 act or Treasure trove.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"2","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shillingstone","county":"Dorset","district":"North Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT-8CBFA4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
