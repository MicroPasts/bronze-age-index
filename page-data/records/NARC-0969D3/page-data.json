The object is composed of a triangular blade which tapers to a point and is lenticular in cross sections due to a broad mid-rib. The butt end is flat D-shaped butt-end with a crescentic notch to either side - the result of worn-through rivet holes. The butt-end also has a crescentic notch which appears intentional, also to accommodate a rivet\n\n\n\nLength: 66.77mm, Width: 20.76mm, Thickness: 3.34mm, Weight: 12.8g\n\n\n\nThis example falls into Burgess and Gerloff's group II, 'dirks with damaged or ill-formed blades modified for rehafting'\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark green in colour with a slightly pitted patina and areas of lighter green corrosion. \n\n\n\nSimilar examples of group II dirks have been recorded on the PAS database as WILT-B91985, BH-C79921, SF-E9C52D and WILT-530139. See also examples published in formal literature (Burgess, C. and Gerloff, S. 1981. The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland. Praehistorische Bronzefunde, IV, 7. Muenchen). The short nature of many dirks belonging to this group suggests that they were manufactured from fragments of larger blades.\n\n\n\nReference: Burgess, C. and Gerloff, S. 1981.
