The axe thins to the butt, which is convex and is moderately rounded (with a width of 35.2mm). The axe has a sub-rectangular to sub-oval body section, with some erosion of the edges. The faces are gently convex across both their lengths and widths without any suggestion of flanges at the sides.  Both sides are slightly concave, with the suggestion that they are beginning to flare-out more sharply at the break (where the axe has a maximum surviving width of 41.8mm and a maximum surviving thickness of 10.2mm). The break occurred in antiquity and is worn and rounded. The original surface survives in patches over the faces with a green brown patina and with no decoration, elsewhere the surface is pale green.\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the axe makes typological identification difficult; however visual inspection suggests that the metallurgical composition is bronze, rather than copper, and together with its comparatively large size, would seem to imply that the axe would be more likely to be of Type Migdale","fourFigureLat":"51.665917","fourFigureLon":"-3.172573","fromdate":"-2300","todate":"-2050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"July 28, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Newbridge","county":"Caerphilly","district":"Caerphilly","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"71.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
