The blade of the Dirk has a pointed oval cross section and a raised central rib. The blade edges appear to have suffered some corrosion as does the butt. The butt is quite rounded due to corrosion but would probably have been trapezoidal in shape and shows the remains of two rivet holes on the left and right side. The object weights 29.81g; the length measurement is 76.22mm; width across butt is 31.05mm; thickness of remaining blade is 3.9mm.","fourFigureLat":"53.854917","fourFigureLon":"-1.438993","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Marshall","datefound1":"January 16, 2004","datefound2":"January 16, 2004","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thorner","county":"Leeds","district":"Leeds","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/amarshall/dirk2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"76.22"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
