It is broadly sub trapezoid in plan, although the axe has lost too much of its original shape to confidently assign it to a type using Schmidt and Burgess (1981). No. 270, pg. 50, Plate 22 has a generally similar shape apart from its smaller, flatter butt. The axe itself has a fairly narrow and rounded butt (36.5mm wide) and appears to have relatively straight sides although one is slightly convex- again it is difficult to tell the original side shape due to the heavy corrosion. The cutting edge is strongly curved and unexpanded. The axe is flat lenticular in profile, and rectangular in section. \n\n\n\nThe axe is heavily corroded, with much of the surface covered with active corrosion and corrosion products. This corrosion has led to the total loss of the original surface, changing the shape of the axe. The parts of the axe not covered by corrosion bear a dull red brown patina of uneven, pitted texture. The dull red colour may suggest that the axe is made of copper rather than copper alloy, which would date it to the chalcolithic, the earliest part of the Bronze Age (c. 2500-2200 BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.82050768","fourFigureLon":"-4.27932397","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-1601","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper","identifier":"George Whatley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llandyfaelog","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/FlatAxe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"107.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
