In plan the fragment is almost D-shaped with a curved blade edge and sides which narrow slightly from this before ending at a very worn transverse break. The cross section at this  break is rectangular, bulging slightly at the waist. while in profile the axehead is more triangular, it narrowing evenly from the break to the blade edge. There is no trace of the socket at the broken end.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a pale green patina for the internal metal; at the surface it is a darker green-brown in colour and is delaminating.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is 34mm long, 33mm wide, 11mm thick and weighs 35.39 grams.\n\n\n\nThe fragment represents part of the blade end of a rectangular bodied socketed axe.
