None of the diagnostic features are present on the blade fragments, but the sword is likely to be a Ewart Park type sword of the Ewart Park metalworking tradition, c. 950 - 750BC. The sword blade is leaf-shaped and is widest at the centre of the fragment. The combined fragments (c. 300mm) probably represent a little over three quarters of the original blade length and approximately half the original length of the sword. The blade has a low lozenge shaped section, with a rounded mid-section and slightly concave outer section. The blade edges have been lost, but the start of the bevel is discernible in areas. The blade appears to have been bent prior to breaking, as evidenced by visible metal stress on the inside of the bend either side of the fracture. The sword bent by an angle of approximately 25 degrees before breaking. The bending has also resulted in both fragments being curved along their length. The sword was probably bent and broken prior to its deposition. One of the ends (probably the tip end) has deep parallel striations running along the blade on the mid section, which are also likely to have occurred in antiquity. The blade has a dark green patina, with small areas of surface loss. The fragments' length is 170mm hilt end and 132.5mm tip end. Its surviving width closest to the hilt is 26mm and its surviving width closest to tip is 23mm. The fragments' maximum width is 33.5mm. The thickness at the hilt end is 8.5mm and the thickness at the tip end (i.e. the minimum thickness) is 6.8mm. The overall maximum thickness is 8.8mm and the thickness at the break is 8.1mm. The blade fragments weigh 205 grams and 148.2 grams, hilt end and tip end respectively.","fourFigureLat":"51.500882","fourFigureLon":"-3.456477","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/DSCN2339.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"302.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
