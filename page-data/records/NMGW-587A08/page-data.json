The blade has no clearly defined midrib and is of lenticular section of consistent thickness (of 5.8mm – 6.3mm). The blade is comparatively slender and both original blade edges have been lost. The blade edges were straight and convergent to one end (with a maximum surviving blade width of 20.4mm and minimum width of 17.8mm). The short blade fragment has a gentle curve across its length, with the suggestion of bending prior to breaking. The surface is very heavily-corroded and much of the original surface with a dark grey-green patina over red-brown areas of surface loss.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively slender form of the blade may suggest that it’s derived from just above the tip of a sword although a rapier fragment is also possible. Rapiers date from the Middle Bronze Age while leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.","fourFigureLat":"51.50258281","fourFigureLon":"-3.31245204","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pentyrch","county":"Cardiff","district":"Cardiff","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/201738new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"31.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
