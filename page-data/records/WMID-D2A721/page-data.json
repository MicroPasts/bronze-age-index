Only this fragment of the socket remains with irregular breaks at both ends as well as a high degree of corrosion. On either side of the socket, the humped remains of two side loops are still visible. They are also of irregular size as one appears larger than the other (width: 5.9mm x 4.2mm).\n\n\n\nThere is a similar example illustrated in Watson's 'Catalogue of British & European Prehistoric Metal in Birmingham City Museums', 1993, page 11, ref no 87, found in Kingsbury, Warwickshire. There are other examples in Susan M. Pearce's publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain', Part ii, 1983, found in numerous areas, but most notably Hambledon Hill, Hod Hill, Cheddar, near Blandford Camp and near Glastonbury. H. N. Savory in 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections', 1980, pages 49-51, adds that 'side-looped' spearheads were heavily produced in local North Wales industries with loops further up the socket in comparison with previous examples as well as having leaf-shaped blades. These spearheads were also popular in southern England.\n\n\n\nThis example may have had a short stabbing blade (mostly likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age I between c. 1450-1250 BC) or a longer weapon (mostly likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age II period between c. 1250-1050 BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.939181","fourFigureLon":"-2.224639","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-1050","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"January 01, 2001","datefound2":"January 01, 2001","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"13.7","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Swynnerton","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-D2A721.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"52.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
