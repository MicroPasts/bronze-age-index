The surviving fragment comprises only of the blade-end, only surviving between the cutting edge and the end of the internal socket. The fragment is rectangular in plan and sub-triangular when viewed in profile. The sides of the axe are broadly parallel, tapering very slightly from the cutting edge, although without flaring blade tips. The cutting edge is slightly convex. Either lateral face of the axe has a pronounced, longitudinal casting seem, creating an elongated sub-hexagonal cross section. The socket is an elongated, sub-oval in cross section and either broad face is plain.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 45.3mm; width 38.9mm; thickness 13.6mm; weight 82.45g.\n\n\n\nAlthough too fragmentary for a certain attribution, the fragment probably belongs to the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119), a similar fragment of very similar form, also from the South Hams, has previously been recorded on this database: DEV-C9D5FD.","fourFigureLat":"50.26471213","fourFigureLon":"-3.75517237","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Charleton","county":"Devon","district":"South Hams","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEVFAC9D2.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"45.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
