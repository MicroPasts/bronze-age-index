The awl has a square cross section. Both ends taper to a sharp point. One point is slightly longer than the others and each of the four faces is slightly indented. There are some scratches on the rounded end. Some awls may have been hafted in to a wooden or bone handle however this example was probably used in the hand without hafting as both ends of the awl are useful, practical tools.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 27.08mm long, 4.59mm, 4.62mm and 1.56g in weight.\n\n\n\nDescription: From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as \"pointed punches\" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin.","fourFigureLat":"51.11893097","fourFigureLon":"1.07070705","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.59","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lyminge","county":"Kent","district":"Shepway","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTA73509.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"27.08"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
