It consisted of a central, ogival section flanked by two flukes. With the spearhead are fragments of wood which probably represent part of its shaft preserved by contact with copper. The small head seen on this weapon can be compared to an example from Lakenheath, Suffolk (Evans,1881, 322-323, fig. 395). Evans refers to an example from Cumberland with a still smaller blade but, at 124mm, it was still larger than this find. It is, however, of comparable proportions to the spearhead from Tidmarsh, Berkshire, BERK-9C5258.
