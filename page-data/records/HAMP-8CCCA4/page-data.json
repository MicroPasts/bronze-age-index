In plan, the end of the butt is damaged as the corners are clipped; it has a width of c. 20.3mm. Modern damage central to the end of the butt can be identified by the lack of patina. The long side-edges of the axe are slightly flanged (being c.0.5mm thicker at the very edge than just inside it), with the stop ridge on the surface being just off centre to the widest section of the flanged sides, 48.2mm from the butt and 59.0mm from the blade. The stop ridge is 9mm thick, tapering to either end where it measures 2.45mm at the butt and 3.20mm at the blade. In plan, the blade flares outwards to form a crescent shape and is evenly curved but slightly asymmetrical. This axe is abraded and pitted overall, and has small patches of a dark green patina. This patina shows numerous vertical scratches and it is uncertain whether this is the result of the metal working procedure, or post depositional. There is no indication of any decoration.\n\n\n\nAlthough a precise date can not be ascertained, the author believes this Early Bronze Age axe head to be dated between 2350 and 1700 BC. This encompasses two distinctive axe types:\n\n\n\n2350 - 2050 BC Migdale type: metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. Similar to LVPL-DA4598\n\n\n\n2050-1700 BC Aylesford type: metalworking tradition phase IV, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC.
