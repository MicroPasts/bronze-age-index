For most of its length it has a rounded cross-section with a maximum diameter of about 9mm.  It narrows towards each terminal, before expanding slightly into terminals with a squarish cross-section about 6-7mm across.  It is bent slightly out of shape.  This object is possibly of Bronze Age date, but its lack of diagnostic features makes this uncertain.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"Recovered from 'scrap box' five years after discovery.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Richardson","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Richardson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Kent","district":"Thanet","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/arichardson/KENT-58F468.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"111.76"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
