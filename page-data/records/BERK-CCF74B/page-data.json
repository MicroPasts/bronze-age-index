Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is likely between the hilt and the middle of the sword as this is where the blade tapers before expanding at the mid-point.  There may be some dot impression decoration on both surfaces which has a mottled dark green and brown patina.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is probably a fragment from a sword, dagger, knife or rapier of the Late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.67678072","fourFigureLon":"-1.03242226","fromdate":"1000","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","datefound1":"February 01, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dr. Lindsey Smith","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"6.5","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pyrton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bertie123/BERKCCF74B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"31.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
