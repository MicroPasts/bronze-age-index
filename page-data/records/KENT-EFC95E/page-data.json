The fragment is sub-oval and appears to be the cutting-edge of a socketed axehead; the interior of the socket is visible, forming a shallow sub-triangular hollow along the break, which is uneven. The cutting-edge is worn and is now rounded; the breaks are also worn. The entire object is covered with mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion and green and black patina.
