The object is covered in a pale yellowish green patina with patches of dark grey probably representing the dark silts in which it was found. There are very occasional small patches of bright copper metal showing. In profile, the sides of the axe are parallel flaring out abruptly to form a crescent shaped blade at one end and expanding slightly at the socketed end to produce a 'collar' around the mouth of the socket. Viewed on edge, the axe is a distinctly triangular shape with a prominent oval attachment loop projecting from one edge. Both edges show remnants of significant casting seams which are very rounded perhaps through wear or possibly through rough finishing during the manufacturing process. The blade is asymmetrical with one point of the blade noticeably longer than the other, possibly the result of sharpening over time.  The socket is a rounded rectangular shape narrowing to a lozenge shape towards the blade.  \n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nThe small size of the axe may indicate that it was intended for a more specialised activity such as carpentry rather than simply forest clearance.
