The fragment consists of the cutting edge and a small portion of the lower blade of a Mid - Late Bronze Age axe or palstave (1500 - 800 BC). The fragment is D or crescent shaped in plan with a curved convex cutting edge. In section the axe fragment is sub-triangular. The convex cutting edge of the axe fragment, although pitted through corrosion and slightly abraded by the soil, is worn and shows areas of possible sharpening. There is little evidence for the sides tapering inwards above the cutting edge. This is due to a large lateral break which has removed this part of the blade from the rest of the axe-head. This break seems to have occurred relatively recently as the edges are fresh, jagged and show no evidence of abrasion. The area of the break is heavily pitted with small hollows which may have weakened the structure of the blade at this point. The fragment of axe is a dark mid-green brown colour with an even but corroded patina. There are a number of patches of light green powdery (active) corrosion and areas of corrosive pitting present. The area around the break is a mid orange colour; this may be due to the burial conditions or the presence of iron objects in the plough soil. The fragment measures 59.2mm width, 18.7mm length, and is 7.7mm thick. It weighs 21.6 grams. It is very difficult with such a small fragment of metalwork to tell which type of axe it is from; it is most likely to be from either a palstave of Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150 BC) date or a socketed axe of the Late Bronze Age (1150â€“800BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.676474","fourFigureLon":"-2.726155","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"October 06, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Peter Reavill","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bayston Hill","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-A938D2 illustration.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Finder","length":"59.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
