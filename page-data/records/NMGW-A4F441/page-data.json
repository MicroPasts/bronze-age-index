The axe is of sub-hexagonal section at the break (with a width of 44.3mm and a thickness of 9.7mm). One face of the axe is considerably thicker than the other (4.8mm compared to 2.9mm) because of misalignment of the core during casting, which may have caused weaknesses in the axe. The sides are moderately straight to concave for the short surviving section before diverging to the blade edge. The casting seams are discernible on the sides and appear to have been hammer-finished. The blade edge has been lost but was curved (with a surviving width of 47.3mm). The socket of the axe is now closed and both faces are concave across their widths, indicating that the axes faces were crushed. Both faces also display numerous battering marks and the thinner face has torn through the battering. Sharpening striations are evident running along the blade. The surface has a dark green patina where it survives and is pale green elsewhere.\n\n\n\nSocketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC although most recovered socketed axes are of EwartPark phase. The axe may have been of South Wales (Stogursey) type although the blade is comparatively broad for the type.","fourFigureLat":"51.508954","fourFigureLon":"-3.528785","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 11, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pencoed","county":"Bridgend","district":"Bridgend","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.140.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"42.32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
