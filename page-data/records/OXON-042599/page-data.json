It is missing the majority of its blade to an abraded transverse break placed 14mm below the stopridge.\n\n\n\nThe butt of the axe is c.20.2mm wide, c.3.9mm thick and has a diagonal edge that is straight but worn.  The septum measures c.66.9mm in length and is mostly consistent in thickness along its length narrowing very slightly at the stop ridge due to two small casting flaws on each side. The flanges of this axe begin 11mm after the butt and widen in a slightly convex curve reaching their tallest point (c.26mm) 9mm before the stop ridge from which they are a consistent height. The stop ridge is a very shallow crescent shape.\n\n\n\nThe blade extends 14mm beyond the stop ridge before ending in an abraded break over which distance it is straight sided. It is thinner than the stop ridge being c.9.9mm thick creating a slight ledge marked by a concave curve. It narrows slightly along its length. The flanges continue along the outside edges of the axe creating two raised borders (flange extensions) which flank a pronounced a central raised midrib.\n\n\n\n Shallow but clear casting seams can be seen running along the middle of the axe down its length.\n\n\n\nThe axe has a dark orange brown patina that has been chipped in a few spots revealing light green colour underneath. There are some concreted iron pan deposits around the septum suggesting it was, at some point placed within waterlogged conditions.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is 89.7mm long, 25.5mm wide, 26mm thick if including the flanges and weighs 181 grams\n\n\n\nThe characteristic features of this palstave are the relatively straight stop ridge (rather than curved), convex and then stepped flanges which begin after the butt and which rise higher than the the stop ridge, and raised flange continuations flanking a midrib decorating the blade. The lack of a blade shape prevents a certain identification however these features are all shared by Primary phase palstaves of the Oxford type examples of which are illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981: pl.58 Nos 788-799).
