The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded sub-oval or leaf-shaped blades. The hollow socket is near complete and is slightly chamfered at the base.. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge. The tip of the spearhead is complete however the side blades have been broken. The overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) pointed midrib. This midrib expands to the socket of the spear. The central raised line of the mid-rib does not extend into the socket. The socket is roughly half the whole length of the spear. The cross section of the spear is lentoid and the socket is circular. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams have been filed or polished away. \n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 104.02mm length, has a maximum width (across base of socket) of 14 mm. The depth of the socket is 55 mm. The spearhead weighs 42.89 grams. The mouth of the socket has a diameter of 12.5mm and a thickness of 2 mm.\n\n\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).","fourFigureLat":"50.76330752","fourFigureLon":"-2.25658361","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rachel Mowbray","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rachel Mowbray","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bere Regis","county":"Dorset","district":"Purbeck","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/caht/1F4D7C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"104.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
