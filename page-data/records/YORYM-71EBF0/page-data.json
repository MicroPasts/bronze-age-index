The object is sub-rectangular in plan and section, tapering in width from cutting edge to butt. At the midpoint worn semi-circular lug like projections/trunnions extend to either side. The object is eroded by plough roll/abrasion.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-green patina and is worn. The chisel is 88.5mm long, 12.9mm tapering to 3.8mm wide, 5.5mm tapering to 2.9mm thick and weighs 23.6g.\n\n\n\nA similar example has been recorded as HESH-51B7E2 in which it states that such tools are dated to the metalworking tradition phase VIII - IX, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 5 circa 1500-1150 CAL. BC. This record also cites a number of published examples such as from Yattendon Berks (Evans 1881: p169 Fig. 196) and Harbledon, Kent (Rowlands 1976 cat no 1108 p 351/pl36). The latter reference also suggests the date range for these as being from the early Middle Bronze Age with a peak in the Middle Bronze Age with a few examples turning up within assemblages of late Bronze Age date (ibid p44). A distinct pattern of distribution is suggested in the West and in Ireland (ibid) with examples of these being discovered in Shropshire, Cheshire and Wrexham, specifically within the Meole Brace (Edgebold Brickyard) Hoard (Rowlands 1976 after Chitty 1925) and Broxton Cheshire (Evans 1881; 169) and now the Burton Hoard PAS-5B1745. All these examples are associated with either spearheads or palstaves reinforcing a Middle Bronze Age dating probably associated with Acton Park II or Taunton traditions / assemblages.","fourFigureLat":"54.01086308","fourFigureLon":"-0.68916734","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thixendale","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/CH0156.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"88.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
