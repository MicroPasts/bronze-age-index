The cutting edge measures 26.39mm in width and is 5.2mm thick. The cutting edge is blunt and damaged. In profile the blade is sub-rectangular and narrow slightly before the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge where ribs might be expected is no visible decoration. The surface of the opposite face is 'clean' and shows no indications of decoration.\n\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The butt end measures 21.46mm in width and is 3.4mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) measures 45.56mm in length. For one face the septum is prominent with a wide flange. The opposit face has a flat septum and no flange. The flanges may have been misscast or more likely have been lost due to abrasion. It is unclear if a side loop is present due to extreme wear and corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe object has a light green patina and has arough and pitted surface.\n\n\n\npatches of a dark brown surface but most of the axe has a mid-green patina that is roughly abraded and pitted.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 109.11mm; width 24.68mm; thickness 13.99m; weight 163.22g\n\n\n\nThis object is similar to the Type Nettleham axeheads illustrated in Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), plate 67, no 902, espeically if undecorated, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 - BC 950. Marking a transition between palstaves and socketed axeheads.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples on the PAS database include: LVPL-AB829B and WMID-306462","fourFigureLat":"53.69196497","fourFigureLon":"-1.22914592","fromdate":"-1050","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Heather Beeton","datefound1":"July 10, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Heather Beeton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.99","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Knottingley","county":"Wakefield","district":"Wakefield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/heatherbeeton/LVPL61E1DF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"109.11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
