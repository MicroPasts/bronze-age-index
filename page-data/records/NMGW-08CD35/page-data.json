The interior of the mouth is oval (27.2mm x 190mm) and the top irregular with the suggestion of four-runner casting. The exterior of the mouth is sub-rectangular (39.6mm x 27.5mm) with a prominent rounded mouth moulding or collar (3mm &ndash; 6mm thick and 10mm -13mm long) and has a noticeable shelf on the sides. The corners of the moulding are noticeably angular. The loop (19.4mm long, 11.0mm high and 7.0mm wide) springs from the base of the moulding. The sides of the axe are straight and near-parallel on their upper half and flat across the depths, producing a rectangular body section to the axe. The lower half of the axe sides are divergent, with the unlooped side being near-straight and the looped side gently concave. The flattened casting seams are evident on both sides and are both off-centre. The axe is widest across the expanded blade (with a blade width of 46.8mm) and has a moderate curvature (6mm deep).&nbsp; The faces are near-flat across their widths and convergent but convex across their lengths with no blade facets or ribs present. The surface is corroded with a rough corrosion product and dark-green patina. There is a clear discernible black surface beneath the corrosion on the upper two-thirds of the axe, probably tenorite.\n\nThe interior of the socket has at least two small fragments of copper alloy wedged at its base. One fragment appears to be plate bronze and may be an axe wall fragment or similar, the other fragment below is thicker with a right-angled corner, possibly a blade.&nbsp;&nbsp; \n\nThe axe appears to share some characteristics of early socketed axes, principally it&rsquo;s slender rectangular body section, mouth moulding and parallel sides. This axe also has some more developed features, such as the expanded blade with divergent sides above the blade. The angular corners of the moulding may be seen as similar to Amorican axes of Llyn Fawr metalworking but the mouth is clearly not of front-back form. An early, Wallington is possible but a later Ewart Park (c. 1000 &ndash; 700BC) date is perhaps more likely. \n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. &amp; Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern England, Pra&auml;historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
