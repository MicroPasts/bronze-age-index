There is a triple  mouth-moulding, of which the upper moulding is much more prominent. This has a small casting flaw at one point causing a slight step. The lowest moulding gives rise to a half-circular loop on one side of the body. In cross-section the body is sub-rectangular, the aperture is almost square with rounded corners, narrowing downwards to a blunt rectangle. In plan the body runs parallel for most of its length expanding from about two-thirds of the way down to the cutting edge which forms a very shallow curve with outside corners close to 45 degrees. In profile the axehead forms a long narrow triangle, with a casting ridge visible on both sides. On the side with the loop this ridge runs in an uninterrupted seam through the outside of the loop.  There is evidence of mineralised organic woven material on at least one face (when holding the axehead neck upwards loop to the left.","fourFigureLat":"50.661382","fourFigureLon":"-1.124177","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Part of a hoard of eleven implements.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"","datefound1":"February 01, 2002","datefound2":"March 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"44.43","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Sandown","county":"Isle of Wight","district":"Isle of Wight","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sworrell/IOW2002-26 Kirkton Hoard.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Finder","length":"134.46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
