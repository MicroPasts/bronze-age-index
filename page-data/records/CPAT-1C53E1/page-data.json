The butt is straight and narrow but is moderately thick (with a width of 19mm and a thickness of 5.5mm). The sides are markedly straight for their entire lengths, gradually diverging from the butt, towards the gently curved blade. There is some damage to the blade being heavily eroded - one blade tip having been lost. The more complete blade tip shows minimal flaring, producing a trapezoidal form. The axe form is unusual within the British and Irish traditions and is possibly a variant of copper trapezoidal axes with a continental European provenance. X-rays showed that there is a dense metal coating of the axe with high levels of silver, plus antimony and lead.\n\n\nThought to belong to the period of 2,300-1900BC (Lodwick.
