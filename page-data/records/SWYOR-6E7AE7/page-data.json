The cast axe is near-complete. It has expanding straight sides, flaring more at the cutting end into a curved cutting edge, which is slightly lopsided, possibly from use or damaged. The butt also has straight sides, tapering towards the rounded butt. There is a thickening in the centre of the axe; the start of a proto stop ridge, but no actual stop or flanges. The axe has a well developed green patina with some pitting.  The total length is 51.1mm, the length of the blade is 27.3mm, the length of the butt is 19.7mm.  The width of the blade is 15.7mm tapering to 10.7mm.  The width of the butt is 10.1mm tapering to 8.4mm.  The thickness of the blade is 4.8mm at the centre tapering towards the edges.  The weight is 12.88g.\n\n\n\nParallels on the database include HAMP-B3BE22 which is recorded under FLANGED AXEHEAD (Class: miniature) and is very similar in scale and shape to this example. Other items with similarities, such as HAMP-710DC5 are recorded as CHISEL, while further examples such as NMS-4436A4 are recorded as MINIATURE OBJECT. YORYM-3F6A11 is a miniature flat axe and the record suggests that it is too small to be functional, commenting that miniature axes modelled on later Bronze Age types (such as socketed axes) have been found on Iron Age and Roman sites in secure contexts. Compare also IOW-40D79C. Tanged chisels such as SUR-505F93 and SUSS-AEB91C are also similar but have a tang that terminates in a point. They are also very difficult to date, but the patina on this example is consistent with a Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"54.1018357","fourFigureLon":"-0.79335614","fromdate":"-2250","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andy Benbow","datefound1":"July 24, 2020","datefound2":"July 24, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andy Benbow","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norton-on-Derwent","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR6E7AE7BronzeAgeChiselikw.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"51.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
