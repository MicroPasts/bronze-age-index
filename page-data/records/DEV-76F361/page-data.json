In section, the axe head is lenticular in shape. In plan, the axe head is roughly triangular in shape; the butt end is narrow and has a rounded end, and the sides flare out towards the cutting edge. The cutting edge is cresentic in shape. There are signs of wear on the cutting edge, suggesting it has been used. There are also file marks visible on the surface of both faces, suggesting that the blade has been re-sharpened on the surface. Overall, the surface patina is smooth and dark green. A similar example, found in Dorset, can be seen on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database (DOR-422514), this example was compared to the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage by Kevin Leahy, and dated to 1600 to 1500 BC. As the Devon example has a similar form, it may be attributed to a similar date. Length: 155mm; Width of blade: 80mm; Width of butt end: 23mm; Thickness (at thickest point in middle): 10mm.","fourFigureLat":"50.40236128","fourFigureLon":"-3.56324672","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Danielle Wootton","datefound1":"June 29, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Danielle Wootton","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Churston-with-Galmpton","county":"Torbay","district":"Torbay","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwootton/Alan Miller flat axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
