The cutting edge is heavily abraded, as is the surface of the blade so not sure whether it is symmetrical or asymmetrical through use. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. There are no traces of a casting seam but this may be due to corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe palstave, on both faces, has a prominent straight stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. There are no hollows or ribs before the stop-ridge. The flange sides are a sub oval in profile with a flattened surface along the centre which was probably due to the removal of a casting seam.\n\n\n\nIn plan the septrum is rectangular and the butt has an abraded edge. The flange tops lean inwards over the septrum forming a convex exterior surface of the flange. \n\n\n\nThe palstave has a well-developed brown patina which is incomplete and abraded. \n\n\n\nThe palstave measures 155.16mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 61.33mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 27.81mm thick across the apex of the flanges. It weighs 466g.\n\n\n\nSimilar to Figure 19, No. 129 in Savoury (1980). The palstave is an early/primary example dates to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to c. 1500-1300 BC.\n\n\n\nSavory, H.N. 1980 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections National Museum of Wales: Cardiff","fourFigureLat":"51.87552279","fourFigureLon":"-4.22399228","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"August 30, 2017","datefound2":"October 03, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.81","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Abergwili","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW44B22D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"155.16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
