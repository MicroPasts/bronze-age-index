However, due to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from Bronze Age - Roman period (c. 1500 BC - 450 AD). This fragment is from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould. The casting waste is conical; being oval in plan and D shaped in cross section. In profile the edges of the waste taper relatively evenly. The base of the casting waste is irregular with the remains of two runners / casting jets being present. These jets / runners are heavily abraded. The sides show no evidence of casting seams although they are also similarly abraded. The upper surface is pitted and rough, although heavily patinated: at the centre of the upper surface is a slight depression. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. The casting waste is a mid green colour with a slight mid grey coloured corrosion product present in several areas. Casting waste is very hard to date in isolation but the patina and form might suggest a Bronze Age - Roman date. The fact that this mould comes to an oval broken edge may suggest that it was for casting a palstave or possibly a tool; it is most likely to date from the Middle Bronze Age. A direct comparison has not been found. The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.\n\n\n\nLength: 29.1mm, Width: 28.7mm, Thickness: 19.5mm, Weight: 50.93gms","fourFigureLat":"53.67609995","fourFigureLon":"-0.50277172","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Martin Foreman","datefound1":"April 10, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Undergoing further examination at a museum","recorder":"Martin Foreman","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"South Ferriby","county":"North Lincolnshire","district":"North Lincolnshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mforeman/NLM47138.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"North Lincolnshire Museum","length":"29.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
