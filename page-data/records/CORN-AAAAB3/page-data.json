The central rib is remaining and half of the blade edge is worn away on either side. Pronounced edge bevels on both sides. The fragment is tapered in plan which suggests that this is a fragment approaching the tip end of the sword blade. The blade is lozenge-shaped in section with a substantial but broad rib which suggests it is likely to date from the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC).","fourFigureLat":"50.382446","fourFigureLon":"-4.659795","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"August 31, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Clemesfinds 015.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"24.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
