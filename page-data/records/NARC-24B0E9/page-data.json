The object is a long flanged developed flat axe.\n\n\n\nThis axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, with some slight recurving.\n\n\n\nShallow ovate cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a lenticular side profile.\n\n\n\nThere is a raised transverse stop-ridge running half way down the butt length. \n\n\n\nThe metal is brown in colour with areas of light blue active copper alloy disease on both faces, predominant on one face but present on the other. \n\n\n\n\n\nLength: 134.42mm, Width (blade end): 78.32mm, Width (butt end): 27.18mm, Thickness (at flanges): 25.84mm, Weight: 439.0g\n\n\n\nSchmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, \"...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembelleshed faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature. Decoration...becomes a commonplace...\"\n\n\n\nSchmidt and Burgess (ibid.) explain that these developments were in part a function of changing hafting methods - the knee handle, with forked angled end required a narrower shape to fit snugly between the prongs of the fork. Furthermore, dished faces and raised edges made the seating more secure, and the median bevel reduced the tendency of the axe to be driven up into the fork, (WMID-143A14).","fourFigureLat":"52.15149812","fourFigureLon":"-0.83215728","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25.84","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hartwell","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC24B0E9.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"134.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
