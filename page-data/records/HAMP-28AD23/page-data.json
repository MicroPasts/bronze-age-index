Both faces are slightly convex. In cross-section it is lozengiform with truncated sides.  There is a regular central depression on both faces.  Above this is a perforation, rectangular in shape with rounded end (L.: 5.0mm).  The dating of this object is difficult, although it bears a certain similarity to an artefact illustrated in Read (2001, 63; ref. 488) and described as an impractical 'terret-like object'.  This suggests a date in the Iron Age or Roman periods.  However, an earlier date cannot be ruled out; neither can a late one as suggested by the regularity of the object.","fourFigureLat":"51.086483","fourFigureLon":"-1.558779","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"March 13, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Broughton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-28AD23terret.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"21.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
