In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is narrowed and rounded in profile. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. There are no traces of a stop ridge present. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade are abraded as is the blade edge itself.\n\n\n\nLength: 67.26mm, Width (blade): 28.87mm, Width (butt): 16.45mm, Thickness: 9.37mm, Weight: 55.80g\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark green/brown in colour with a heavily pitted and corroded patina. \n\n\n\nThe axehead date to the Early Bronze Age and fits within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
