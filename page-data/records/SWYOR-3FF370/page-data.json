The rod is sub-circular in section with sharply cut ends. The ring has a diameter of 33.9mm, is 13.2mm tall over three coils of the rod, and the rod is 4.9mm thick. There is an even light green and brown patina on all surfaces. This large ring could have been used as currency and probably dates from the Bronze Age or Iron Age. There is a very close parallel in the Yorkshire Museum Boynton Collection (YORYM 2006.1110) which is from Cyprus. There are also similar examples, but larger and described as bracelets, on page 121 of Nicholson (1980) Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in Merseyside County Museums.
