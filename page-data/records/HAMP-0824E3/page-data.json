Part of the blade tip and cutting edge remains. The object is highly corroded. It is largely a light, dusty green colour. The fragment is largely undiagnostic and so a date is hard to achieve. The fragment may have belonged to a flat axe, a palstave or a socketed axe and so its date of manufacture could range from anywhere between c. 2500 BC (with the introduction of bronze flat axes) and c. 700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.092748","fourFigureLon":"-1.087497","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Richard Milwain","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Richard Milwain","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ropley","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-0824E3BAaxefragment.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"37"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
