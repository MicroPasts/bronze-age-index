The object is copper-alloy and is 28 mm long and 24 mm wide. The axe is flanged in profile, with a ridge on each edge of the axe on the obverse and reverse, making the axe appear like a capital I on its side in profile. These ridges are to allow the axe handle to be slotted into the axe before being secured with a twine binding. The break is worn smooth and the axe was evidently broken in antiquity. The axe dates from around 2500 BC to 1200 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.115969","fourFigureLon":"-0.8769","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"April 30, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hanslope","county":"Milton Keynes","district":"Milton Keynes","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-EDBA86axeheadprof.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
