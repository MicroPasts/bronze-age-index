The palstave would date from the middle Bronze Age; however, it is difficult to say when it was made into a wedge. It is likely that this was done during either the later Middle Bronze Age or Late Bronze Age (1500-800 BC). The blade has been broken or deliberately trimmed at the junction point between the blade and the raised flanged stop ridge. It is difficult to ascertain more detail as the broken end has been repeatedly hammered and damaged through use as a 'cold?' chisel. In Plan the wedge is broadly sub-rectangular and is sub-triangular in cross section. The wedge measures 70.6mm length, has a maximum width of 33mm and maximum thickness of 18.1mm. It weighs 149.78 grams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blade of wedge extends from a relatively narrow point, just below the break (stop ridge), and expands with regular straight sides to a much worn convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the break. The thickness of the blade tip is 4.1mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 16.6mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 18.1mm). Beneath the break, is slight evidence of a raised tapering central rib. This rib is very slight and only shows in oblique light, it has been much eroded on both faces. The convex cutting edge is asymmetric and heavily worn with almost all the original blade bevel being lost. It seems that the cutting edge has been reset as the shape of the blade is very flat (by this I mean that the angle the two blade facets make is very low meaning that the two edges have been heavily worn and reshaped). The broken end of the wedge has been repeatedly struck with a blunt tool (hammer) which has flattened the metal, distorting the break and spreading the bronze laterally to form flared surface. To one side is a small sub-circular projection, which has been hammered / flattened. This is the remains of a side loop which would have projected from below the stop ridge and extended to a point on the mid -point of the axe. The loop would have aided hafting. The stub measures 7.9mm length, 7.1mm width.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wedge is a mid green brown colour with an even but abraded patina which covers all surfaces. There is some evidence of erosion caused by movement in the ploughsoil; however, this is limited and minor. There is no evidence of active corrosion on wedge and all surfaces seem stable. A direct parallel for this sort of recycling / re-use have not been found, however, it is likely that this type of recycling is not uncommon. The majority of broken tools would have been recycled for their metal contact and so this may be a rare example of this form of temporary reuse which was at one point common place. The age of the reuse is difficult to ascertain, however it is likely to date from the period the axe was made or shortly thereafter. A broad period of Middle - Late Bronze Age is suggested 1500-800 BC, however it is most like to date from the period (1400-1000BC)","fourFigureLat":"52.86444918","fourFigureLon":"-2.84812465","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Peter Reavill","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cockshutt","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-098032_detail6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"70.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
