The hammer is section waisted, expanding into a flared collar, with four concentric grooves (or three bands or 'ribs') encircling the base of the flared socket end. The socket mouth is sub-circular whilst the interior void appears to taper toward the hammer end. Casting lines running along the upper and lower face of the hammer indicate that it was cast in two parts. These casting marks have mostly been removed or ground out; however, they are clearly visible at the point at which the four concentric grooves meet. The hammer tapers sharply from the socket toward the mid-point, before again flaring more gently toward the hammer face. The striking face of the hammer shows evidence of extensive use-wear, with a pronounced uneven slant visible, together with numerous nicks and gouges.\n\n\n\nThe hammer has a dark brown patina and, with the noted exception of contemporary use-wear, is in excellent condition with no obvious signs of active corrosion.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nThe earliest socketed hammers are recovered from Middle Bronze age contexts, such as those described by Rowlands (1976a and b) and Eogan (1964 274-5) from the Irish 'Bishopland Phase' (approximately contemporary to the Taunton Phase, c.1400-1250BC). However, hammers are more commonly found in association with Late Bronze Age hoards (Rowlands, 1976), as the hammer above was. Burgess (1968, 19) notes that later examples are \"invariably embellished, usually with some form of collar\". The concentric ribs on the example under discussion here could be interpreted as a form of collar; the collar is, however, much clearer on the hammers recorded on the PAS database as YORYM-ABCCE1 and FAKL-9C9543. Nevertheless, the latter examples are the closet parallels thus far recorded by the PAS, particularly as they too have circular sockets. Burgess (ibid) further notes that few parallels exist for the \"longer socketed hammer\" in Northern Britain, of which the hammer described above is likely to be an example. However, it is noticeably shorter by c.20mm than similar long socketed hammers, including hammer LVPL-5A6D83. In common with the majority of these examples, and the remainder of Hoard 2015-T566/DUR-1F5057 (with which the hammer was found; see below) a date consistent with the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park Phase (c.900-800 BC) is likely. At the time of writing, the hammer constitutes the furthest north recorded example on the PAS database, and the first recovered from Co. Durham.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nThe hammer was found with Bronze Age Hoard (2015-T566; DUR-1F5057) and was initially thought to be unrelated. However, the object has since been identified as a late Bronze Age hammer, and has been reported as Treasure on the basis that is was found in the same place as, and had previously been together with, another object that is Treasure (that is, the hoard 2015-T566; DUR-1F5057) and thus falls under the stipulations of the 1996 Treasure Act.\n\n\n\nDimensions:\n\n\n\nOverall length: 76.56mm\n\n\n\nHeight (hammer face): 24.28mm\n\n\n\nWidth (hammer face): 20.35mm\n\n\n\nHeight (waist): 18.94mm\n\n\n\nWidth (waist): 20.03mm\n\n\n\nSocket diameter:\n\n\n\nOuter: 26.68mm\n\n\n\nInner: 19.08\n\n\n\nDepth (socket): 54.75mm\n\n\n\nThickness (socket): 4.59mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 142g\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\nBurgess, C., 1968.
