The tang has broken near the shoulder, and has a rectangular section. The break is not recent. The tang expands in width towards the shoulder which is a transverse ridge on all faces. The blade is a sub-triangle in plan with the sides being slightly concave and the blade is flared, incomplete on one corner, and obliquely angled (probably due to damage). The surface of the chisel has an incomplete dark brown patina. The chisel measures 36.31mm long and 15.96mm wide across the blade. It weighs 9.5g.\n\n\n\nTanged chisels occur from the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1450 BC to 600 BC.), and remain in use until Llyn Fawr Metalwork, 750 - 500BC. The collared chisel can be paralleled with a late Middle Bronze Age example found at Rhys Flintshire (Savory, 1980; No 224).\n\n\n\nSavory, H.
