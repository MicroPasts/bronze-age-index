The spearhead broke in antiquity and there is no socket evident on the fragment. The spear has a width of 20.4mm and a thickness of 8.2mm at the break. The spear had a prominent and comparatively wide rounded midrib (12mm wide at the break). The midrib alignment differs between faces, as is evident on the cross-section break. The sides of the spear are comparatively straight or slightly convex along the length of the fragment. Areas of the original survive with a deep brown patina and show a blade facet (2.5mm wide) and sharpening striations running along the blade. Elsewhere the current surface is pale green. The fragment is curved along its length, suggesting it was bent prior to breaking. The proportions of the fragment may suggest a heavier spearhead type, possibly a Late Bronze Age pegged spearhead with a flame-shaped blade.","fourFigureLat":"51.473737","fourFigureLon":"-3.470011","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200737.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
