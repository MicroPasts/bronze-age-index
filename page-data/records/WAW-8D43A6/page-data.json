The spearhead is socketed; this socket is circular in plan, 18.92mm diameter at the entrance. The edge of the socket is abraded and uneven, but not all this damage occurred recently as there is a patina over the breaks. The socket tapers towards the tip of the blade. Below the blade, on opposite sides there is an integral loop. Each loop has a pointed oval vertical face, whose corners bends and meets the exterior of the socket. The loops are clogged with soil, as is the socket. The blade starts approximately at mid point along the socket and forms a leaf-shape in plan. The edges of the blade are heavily abraded. The surface of the spearhead has a mid-brown coloured patina which is slightly pitted. In length it is 102.95mm long, 27.13mm wide across the loops and 19.38mm thick across the socket. It weighs 90.90g.\n\nPhil Watson (Principle Curator, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) dates the spearhead to the Middle Bronze Age, 1500 - 1150 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.238147","fourFigureLon":"-1.898912","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Phil Watson","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"March 06, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.38","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coughton","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-8D43A6 Drawing.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Candy Stevens","length":"102.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
