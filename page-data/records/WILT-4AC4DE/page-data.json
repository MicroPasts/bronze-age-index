It measures 16.02mm in diameter at its widest point and 14.67mm at its most narrow, making it slightly oval. It is 4.59mm thick and weighs 4.72g. It narrows towards the terminals to 3.95mm. The gap between the terminals measures 1.9mm.\n\n\n\nDiscussion and Date: The Penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Egan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange' (Mark Lodwick and Mary Davis in record NMGW-04216C; references therein). Similar examples to this object are found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database including: DUR-EC189D, HAMP-F7B741, YORYM-0DD2F7.\n\n\n\nConsequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\n\nFiona Johnstone\n\nFinds Liaison Assistant, Wiltshire","fourFigureLat":"51.02409174","fourFigureLon":"-1.74472808","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Fiona Johnstone","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Nina Dierks","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.02","edge":null,"thickness":"4.59","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Downton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/flojohnstone/WILT4AC4DE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
