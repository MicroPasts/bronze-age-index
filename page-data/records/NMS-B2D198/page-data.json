Broadly rectangular with one complete end which exhibits a circular perforation. The strip is bent at a sharp angle and has a number of dents, terminating in a jagged break. There are extensive scratch marks, probably from post-depositional damage. \n\n\n\nDimensions: Length (bent): 37mm. Approximate full length: c. 59mm. Width: 9mm. Thickness: 1mm. Weight: 3.9g. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: The strip was found in an unstratified context during metal detecting. It has no decorative or other diagnostic features, and thus it is difficult to assign a date. Gold strips with perforations at one or both ends first appear in the Bronze Age (e.g. BH-1BE953 / 2014 T901, DOR-173265 / 2006 T380, CORN-8EC344 / 2014 T39). Although some others (e.g. NCL-59F7F8) have been considered undiagnostic and not provably over 300 years old, the balance of probabilities suggests that this example may well be of Bronze Age date.\n\n\n\nDate: Bronze Age, 2350-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.63962015","fourFigureLon":"1.04313442","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"June 25, 2017","datefound2":"June 25, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Runhall","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/62198_B2D198_BA_Ribbon.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"37"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
