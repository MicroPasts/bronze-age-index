In section the spearhead is has a sub-circular tube with short, abraded triangular facets, one on opposite sides which are the abraded blades. The tip is missing and here the spear is a sub-square in section. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is circular. The break at this point is not recent. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has traces of a dark green patina, otherwise the surface is pitted and heavily abraded. \n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 42.78mm in length, 6.40mm in width, and weighs 7.8g.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.","fourFigureLat":"52.0314004","fourFigureLon":"-2.04514052","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"December 31, 1943","datefound2":"December 31, 1985","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Carina Hughes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Beckford","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW76615B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"42.78"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
