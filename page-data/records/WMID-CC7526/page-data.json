In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slightly tapering edges. In cross section the axe is rectangular. One long edge is curved and the opposite is relatively flat. \n\n\n\nThe tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present; it has been lost through abrasion. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. However, almost all of the original patina has been lost through laminating corrosion.  The axe is a mid green colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present. The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). Closest parallel is no 67, discovered at Hill of Finglenny. The axe is similar in size to HESH-ACD6C1 which is described as potentially small in length. \n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 89.6 mm in length, 42.9 mm in width at the blade end, thickness is 5.7 mm and the object weighs 77.6 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.36952266","fourFigureLon":"-2.91204911","fromdate":"-2250","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Victoria Allnatt","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Victoria Allnatt","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Leintwardine","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sburford/WMIDCC7526.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
