The object has a wide triangular cross section with a raised central midrib while the underside has a slightly curved profile. The object narrows in width and thickness towards the tip of the blade. The object appears to be damaged as it displays two irregular notches, and may have been miscast. The tip and the hilt of the object is missing, making identification difficult.","fourFigureLat":"51.74017285","fourFigureLon":"-1.08900055","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"November 06, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Waterstock","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/Devonald bronze blade.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"60.74"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
