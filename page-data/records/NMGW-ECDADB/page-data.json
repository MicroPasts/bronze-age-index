Probably of Davis’ (2012) Group 5 A (Wide Blade) of the Acton Park metalworking phase (1550-1400 BC).\n\n\n\nAt its mouth, the socket has a diameter of 2mm and an aperture diameter of 17.4mm, as well as an aperture depth greater than 43mm (the very end of the shaft aperture is still filled by soil to an unknown depth). Both side loops are present but damaged, sited 14.4mm to 12.7mm above the socket mouth, measuring 17.2mm long by 6.4mm wide and 17.7mm long by 5.6mm wide respectively. The shape of the loop plates is altered by damage and may originally have been oval or lozenge shaped. The loops are cast in line with the blade, and casting flashing is visible between the socket mouth, the loops and the blade. Much of the flashing appears to have been removed by hammering or possibly filing. Two small (one <0.5mm, the other c. 0.8mm) holes are present in each flashing line 12.7-11.9mm below the blade base respectively. The smaller hole enters the socket at an oblique angle and is partially covered by flashing. The size and positioning make it likely that these holes are chaplet holes, remnants of the casting process. \n\n\n\nThe socket tapers into the blade until at c.26.5mm above the bade base becomes a lozenge sectioned midrib that continues as far as the tip. Damage to the blade edges has made it hard to ascertain the blade shape, which is best described as transitional between leaf and flame shaped. It has a blade length of 68.8mm and a 35.4mm wide PMW (Point of Maximum Width) at 32.84% up the full blade length (22.6mm from the blade base). The width of the blade as a percentage of its length is 51.45%. The blade is broad based and curves smoothly from the base to the blade edge. The single intact blade has a small concave “step” from the PMW to the blade edge, after which the blade runs straight to the tip. It is unclear if this is merely damage, or is reworking during the spears’ lifetime. The other blade edge is badly damaged, with 36mm of blade edge destroyed above the PMW and a large chunk 12.7mm long by 8.3mm deep gouged out of the blade just prior to or during recovery. The blades are flat and slightly beveled at the edges.\n\n\n\nThe identification of this spearhead as Davis’ (2012) Group 5 A (Wide Blade) is not certain, but is most likely based on general morphology, especially width of the blade being equivalent to 51.45% of blade length.\n\n\n\nLength: 119.5mm\n\n\n\nWidth: 35.4mm\n\n\n\nThickness: 21mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 75.12 g","fourFigureLat":"51.62440269","fourFigureLon":"-2.75256838","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"George Whatley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shirenewton","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/NMWPA2021311.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"119.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
