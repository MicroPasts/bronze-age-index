The axe thins smoothly from the centre to the blade at one end and butt at  the other, with raised flanges on either side on both faces which are now  damaged and worn, giving an H-shaped section. One flange is more pronounced than the other. No stop bevel is apparent and there is no decoration. The surface is heavily pitted\n\n\nDimensions are length 110 mm, blade width 63 mm, and body width 23 mm at the butt where the flanges end to 31 mm at the base of the blade. Maximum thickness of the body on the side of the most pronounced flange is 13 mm.\n\n\nThe axhead is possibly Needham (1983) Class 5, and dates to the early Bronze Age (Arreton period), c.1700-1500 BC.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mary Chester-Kadwell","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mary Chester-Kadwell","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"","county":"Norfolk","district":"","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mchesterkadwell/57333_EBA_FlangedAxehead_1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"110"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
