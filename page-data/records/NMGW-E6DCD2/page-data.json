Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is eroded with very little of the original surface surviving, making it difficult to determine whether the axe is broken or complete. The axe is now comparatively small with an overall surviving length of 66.13mm. The butt is likely to be damaged with a thickness of 7.5mm. The axe has a width of 18.66mm at the butt, which is concave. The sides are convex across their thickness with a maximum thickness (on the blade) of 11.01mm. The sides are fairly straight and slightly divergent before the blade facet, after which they expand sharply to produce a moderately expanded and curved blade edge with a width of 44.45mm. The axe thickens to a point approximately 16mm from the butt, where there is the suggestion of a poorly preserved median bevel, if correct, then this would suggest the axe has lost the butt end. The axe has a width of 19.92mm at the proposed median bevel. The face edges are now eroded but were raised. The blade facet is evident, approximately 20mm from the blade edge. The axe has poor surface preservation and is heavily pitted with a mid green to pale brown patina. The axe currently weighs 98.9g.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1950","todate":"-1700","notes":"The axe can be paralleled with a number of similar axes. Within the National Museum of Wales' collections similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750-1600 BC.\n\n\n\nClass 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain. In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known. Several are decorated (e.g. Llanbradig, Isle of Anglesey NMGW-6152E8), but the majority are undecorated. Comparable examples have been found at Llandow, Vale of Glamorgan, (NMGW-FDBB88) and Caerwys, Flintshire (Green 1985, 275, Fig.1).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"July 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.01","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nelson","county":"Caerphilly","district":"Caerphilly","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.154.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"66.13"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
