The fragment represents a small area of the upper socket of an area below the moulded mouth. It is irregular in plan and profile being broadly L shaped in cross section. There are no other features present, such as decorative ribs. The metal is a mid green colour with an abraded and corroded surface patina. It is difficult to parallel fragment of axes as they lack the relevant diagnostic markers to be sure of a positive identification.","fourFigureLat":"51.60727559","fourFigureLon":"-1.39491003","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"June 30, 2014","datefound2":"August 07, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"9.46","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lockinge","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2014465.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"40.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
