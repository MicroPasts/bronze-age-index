Ribbed socketed axe - Croxton Type / Class B Southern English ribbed axe\n\n\n\nDimensions: maximum length 102.9mm; blade width 51.3mm; combined weight (including socketed axe fragment 2) 420.8g.\n\n\n\nThis is a complete and slender socketed axe with a flared trumpet shaped mouth and a wide collar band. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section with slightly concave sides expanding to a widened and curved cutting edge. The mouth of the axe is deep, front to back, and of sub-rectangular shape with curved corners. The mouth tops surface is flat with no clear indication of runner stubs or scars. Two ribs and two edge ribs, all near parallel, descend from the base of the collar band, extending approximately half way down the axe faces. A wide loop descends from the lower side of the collar band, while the casting seams have been carefully removed, probably by filing and hammering down each side of the axe. On the blade bevel, surface striations parallel to the cutting edge are evident, indicating the blade was sharpened for use. The axe has a brown patina. Localised patches of blue coloured surface corrosion are evident on one face, raising the possibility that the axe burnt immediately before being placed in the ground.\n\n\n\n2. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - South Wales Type socketed axe (wedged into socket of axe 1)\n\n\n\nDimensions: maximum surviving length in the range of 53-57mm (not precisely ascertainable); surviving external width at mouth 31.3mm; combined weight (including socketed axe 1) 420.8g.\n\n\n\nThis is a mouth, upper face and side fragment of a broad socketed axe with a rectangular cross-section, which has been deliberately forced into the socket of axe 1 (above). The axe has a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding with a flat top. Two projecting runner stubs are evident on the mouth top surface, one located down the mid face section and the other down the mid side section (i.e. at 90 degrees to each other). Two, widely splayed ribs are evident on this partial face fragment, descending from the underside of the mouth and down the face of the axe. A prominent casting seam is evident down the non-loop side of this axe, indicating minimal finishing after casting. The axe fragment has a grey-green coloured patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.42984351","fourFigureLon":"-3.38229101","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"The complete socketed axe (No. 1 above) may be identified as of Croxton Type, also known as a particular form of Class B - Southern English ribbed axes (Northover unpublished, 267; Needham 1990, 32-8). The Croxton type, with its diagnostic flaring trumpet mouth, deep collar band and ribs is so named after a defining example found in Cheshire, within a wider frequency observed along the Welsh Marches (Northover unpublished, 267). It is one form within a wider variety of Class B ribbed axes, found in hoards and as single finds across southern Britain. They are almost always found within hoards dating to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Croxton Type socketed axes have been found in increasing numbers of hoards across south east Wales in recent years, with examples in the Pendoylan, Llantwit Major, Wick, Tal-y-garn 1 and Colwinston (Vale of Glamorgan) hoards and an additional example from the St Arvans (Monmouthshire) hoard (Storrie 1887; Fox 1926; GGAT 1977-8; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, Cats. 280 & 281; 1984, 441b; Northover unpublished, H79 & H124; Gwilt 2004, Appendix 1, Cat. 10; Gwilt & Lodwick 2003; 2004; Lodwick & Gwilt 2007; Gwilt et al 2013a).\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary socketed axe (No. 2 above) wedged into the socket of the complete axe may be identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of pronounced out-splayed mouth, four-runner casting technology, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over thirty hoards now contain at least 140 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4;; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).\n\n\n\nThe forcible ramming of artefact fragments into the sockets of axes is a widespread phenomenon in Britain during the Late Bronze Age. In south east Wales, the recently discovered Cowbridge, Tal-y-garn 2 and Colwinston, Vale of Glamorgan hoards, all of Ewart Park tradition, all show similar practice (Lodwick 2003; Lodwick & Gwilt 2003; Gwilt 2004, 122; Gwilt et al 2013a). It is likely that this represented a social practice involving the deliberate destruction or symbolic killing of objects, immediately before they were placed in the ground.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"December 18, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Adam Gwilt","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"2","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llancarfan","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/DH007018_04.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Wales","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
