Long-flanged axe (Class 5)\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 118.3mm; surviving blade width 63.7mm; surviving weight 266.7g.\n\n\n\nThis is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and very slightly divergent towards the blade end and the sides curve out suddenly to a widely expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The butt end is damaged, making it impossible to tell whether it was straight ended or arched. Approximately 57mm from the butt end, there is a low stopridge across both faces. The flanges, although now damaged, would have risen approximately 3mm above the septum on each face. The blade edge is damaged and fragile, making it difficult to accurately determine the original blade width. On one face, just below the stopridge, the feint traces of decorative hammer marks can be observed, forming three or four linear zones parallel with the stopridge. Hammer marks are also evident along the sides of the axe, though forming no distinct faceting or patterning. On the recurving side of one blade edge, a number of impact marks are present, suggesting use wear. On one upper septum face, there is a patch of green corrosion product. The overall patination is green, although the damaged blade edge, flanges, butt end and stop-ridge have a blue green colouration. These edges are fragile and powdery.\n\n\n\n2. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 119.0mm; surviving blade width 68.1mm; surviving weight 223.0g.\n\n\n\nThis is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and near parallel, the lower sides curving out to a cutting edge that is widely expanded and with a crescentic blade edge. The butt end is damaged, however there is curvature in the remaining edge, suggesting the butt was originally arched. Approximately 51mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges, though partly damaged, rise approximately 2.0mm above the septum on both sides. The blade edge is damaged and fragile and the surviving blade width is less than the original blade width. The sides are hammer faceted into three facets, with cable hammer decoration evident. The overall patination is green-brown in colour, while damaged blade edge, butt end and flanges have a lighter blue-green colouration. The damaged surfaces are fragile and powdery.\n\n\n\n3. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 113.5mm; surviving blade width 57.5mm; surviving weight 199.8g.\n\n\n\nThis is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and slightly divergent towards the blade end, the lower sides curving out to a cutting edge that is widely expanded and with a crescentic blade edge. The butt end is damaged, making it impossible to determine whether the butt end was arched. Approximately 47.5mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges, though damaged, are estimated to have risen approximately 2.0mm above the septum on both sides. The blade edge is damaged and fragile, making it difficult to determine the original blade width. The sides are hammer faceted into three facets. On one side, feint cable hammer decoration can still be observed within the middle facet. It is probable that similar decoration, originally on the other side, has now worn away. On one face, a large patch of blue corrosion can be observed. The axe has a green brown coloured patination, while the damaged blade edge, butt end, flanges and corrosion patches on one face have a lighter blue-green colouration. The damaged surfaces are fragile and powdery.\n\n\n\nIdentification and Discussion (Adam Gwilt)\n\n\n\nThese three axes may all be identified as Class 5 long-flanged axes belonging to the Arreton - Ebnal-Inch Island/Gavel Moss phase (Period 4, Metalwork Assemblage VI) of the Early Bronze Age (e.g. Northover unpublished, 104-13; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-5; Needham et al 1985, iii; Needham 1996, 132-3; Rohl & Needham 1998, 91-2). They are contemporary with the Wessex 2 rich grave tradition and Camerton-Snowshill dagger and knife series across southern Britain, now independently radiocarbon dated to 1750/1700-1500 BC (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 179-80; Needham & Woodward 2008, 7, Fig. 3; Needham et al 2010, 364-5 & Table 1; Woodward & Hunter 2015, 462).\n\n\n\nOne of the flanged axes (No. 1 above) is typologically slightly different to the other two, having a stopridge, rather than a median bevel, being notably thicker in casting and having more prominent cast flanges. Unfortunately, the butt end is damaged, making it impossible to tell whether the butt end was originally straight, as predicted for this type. This shows similarities with Type Balbirnie long-flanged axes of Scotland and with some of the axes included within Type Derryniggin flanged axes of Ireland (e.g. Harbison 1969, 55-66, Pls. 69-78; Burgess & Cowen 1972, 178-9; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-2, Cats. 396-407A; Northover unpublished, 112). This flanged axe would seem to exhibit characteristics more similar to the Inch Island / Gavel Moss metalworking tradition of Ireland and Scotland (e.g. Burgess 1980, 122; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 71-2), although it would also fit within the metrical parameters of a Class 5Da axe (Needham 1983, 198-250). Its more pronounced flanges (RHF of 0.0314) suggest that it could be typologically slightly more developed than the other two flanged axes in the hoard.\n\n\n\nTwo flanged axes (Nos. 2 & 3 above) exhibit very similar attributes: a more slender form, with median bevels, low cast flanges, hammer faceting and hammer cable decoration on their sides. These best correlate with Type Arreton long-flanged axes most densely distributed across southern, eastern and south-western England (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 176-8, Figs. 6 & 7; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 72-5, Cats. 408-25B; Needham 1985; Needham et al 1985, iii; Northover unpublished Cats. 95-108). When the critical measurements for these flanged axes are applied within Needham's metrical classification of Class 5 axes for central and southern Britain (Needham 1983, 198-250), both appear to fit within the parameters of Class 5Da axes, while their relative flange heights, at 0.0216 and 0.0225, sit within the lower range for true Class 5 flanged axes (Needham 1983, 65-6 & 198, Figs. 72-6).\n\n\n\nIn Wales and The Marches, two published hoards of broadly comparable date and containing Arreton type, Class 5 long-flanged axes are the Menai Bridge, Anglesey and Ebnal, Shropshire hoards (Chitty 1940; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Savory 1946; 1980, 115, Cats. 259-60 & Figs. 18 & 29; Needham 1983, 300-13, Fig. 48.1; Lynch 1991, 218-21 & Fig. 60; Northover unpublished, 106-8, H. 7 & 164). Unfortunately, in each case, many of the artefacts reported in the hoards, both discovered during the nineteenth century, have been lost: there are only three of eight axes surviving in the Menai Bridge hoard (single axes now at Bangor Museum, Amgueddfa Cymru and The British Museum) while only one of three axes originally in the Ebnal hoard survives (Savory 1980, 115 & Cat. 260.3, Fig. 29). A further Arreton hoard with flanged axe fragments has very recently been reported from Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (Treasure Case 15.03), but has yet to be studied and reported upon in detail.\n\n\n\nTwo of the flanged axes (Nos. 2 & 3) were found in direct association, while the third was found approximately 3-4m away from the other two. The discovery of all three axes at significant depths of approximately 0.46m beneath the surface is unusual, especially if one is to interpret that the three axes were originally buried together in direct association as a hoard, but dispersed through recent agricultural activity. Commonly, dispersed hoards are discovered at shallower depths, with dispersed artefacts found within shallower ploughsoil, rather than at depth. A number of tenable possibilities can be offered, to explain this. Firstly, it is possible that the hoard was disturbed in antiquity, only to be covered by deep clay soil deposits. Secondly, the hoard may have been disturbed in recent times, only to be recently covered during depression infilling events by the landowner with overlying soil deposit. Thirdly, it is possible that the hoard could have been disturbed at depth by the cutting of deep drainage channels, with one axe being dragged and moved along the line of the drain.\n\n\n\nFinally, it is possible that tentative attempts may have been made to deep plough this area of marginal land, leading to disturbance of the hoard. In addition, it has been shown that the three flanged axes all date to exactly the same Arreton phase of the Early Bronze Age, and could all have been used and deposited at the same time. These axes are relatively rare discoveries in Wales, with only around twenty examples known to date from hoards and as single finds (e.g. Needham 1983, Figs. 224-31; Northover unpublished, 105, Cats. 95-108). It seems unlikely that a third example of closely similar form and date would be buried separately and as a single find at the same place. Therefore, overall, and on a balance of probability given the available evidence, it is felt probable that the third flanged axe was once buried in direct association with the other two and as part of a single hoard group.","fourFigureLat":"51.74879092","fourFigureLon":"-2.95743199","fromdate":"-1750","todate":"-1500","notes":"References\n\n\n\nBurgess, C. 1980.
