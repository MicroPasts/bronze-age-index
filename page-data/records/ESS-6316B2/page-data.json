The pin is 47mm in length with a head diameter of 9mm and a pin width of 3mm.  The pin has a flat head, similar to a nail, and a shaft with a swollen neck.  The only decoration occurs at the junction of the head and the shaft where there are three incised grooves.  This find may be compared with a nail-headed pin from Lulworth (Dorset) (Pearce, S. M. 1983. The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain BAR British Series 120, page 491, plate 62).  This is of similar size, having a head diameter of 11mm and a pin width of 3mm, and the upper part of the shaft is decorated with an incised chevron and linear pattern. The Lulworth pin appears to be substantially complete and its length of 91mm suggests that the Margaret Roding find is about half its original size.","fourFigureLat":"51.792771","fourFigureLon":"0.318624","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1000","notes":"This pin was recorded before a Finds Liaison Officer was appointed to Essex and the object description is a transcription of the record made at the time (Colchester Museums record number E/2421).
