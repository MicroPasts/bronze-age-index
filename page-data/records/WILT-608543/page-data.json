It is broadly triangular in shape and is pointed oval in cross section. The blade widens near the top just underneath where the blade has been deliberately bent and broken. It tapers from a width of 22.5mm at the bent end to the tip where it measures 5.50mm. The right side of the blade is particularly worn and abraded and there is a semi-circular notch missing from just underneath where it reaches its widest point. Where the blade has been deliberately bent it begins to narrow to a width of 19.50mm. The surface of the blade has a dark green patina and is pitted and scored all over.\n\n\n\nThe blade measures 76.65mm in length by 22.50mm maximum width and is 5.05mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"51.01537053","fourFigureLon":"-1.95860828","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Zoe Cavendish","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Zoe Cavendish","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Broad Chalke","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT-608543.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"76.65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
