Each find was assigned a small finds reference number (SF) during excavation, which can be found in brackets following the catalogue number for each find.\n\n\n\nN.B. the weights listed for these finds include soil deposits within and on the exterior of many of the axes, except for those which specify otherwise.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nSword\n\n\n\n1. (SF 23) An incomplete and highly fragmentary copper-alloy antennae sword pommel (cf. PAS find: SUSS-761CD0; see also Von Quillfeldt 1995: Taf. 75, no. 219 'Schwert mit gegossenem Spiralknauf' for a comparable example with integral, probably cast complete loops). The sword pommel survives in multiple fragments, with additional fragments of the grip also retained; the lower portions of the sword hilt that would adjoin the blade appear to be absent. The pommel form is sub-lentoid in plan, with slight losses at both narrowed ends; it is flat in profile. Extending upwards from the narrowed ends of this flat, sub-lentoid form are two antennae loops; these now survive in multiple fragments. Both of the loops complete a full circle, measuring c. 1.7mm in diameter across each loop, with both ends of each loop extending from the flattened sub-lentoid upper surface; this suggests that they were probably cast in the complete looped form, rather than hammered. The fragments which form the loops are broadly flat in section and very thin. From the narrowed ends of the flattened sub-lentoid surface the pommel body extends down to a narrowed sub-oval in plan grip. This grip is incomplete and fragmentary, with its highly fragmentary nature preventing an identification of its complete form or type. Visible within the aperture of this now damaged grip is a layer of a dark grey substance (c. 3mm thick), possibly of organic material, that might have been used as a fixative for the tang of the sword blade; also visible is a small circular perforation that extends through the flattened upper surface of the pommel (c. 6.4mm in diameter) that would have accommodated the tanged end of the sword blade. The antennae sword pommel and grip are in poor condition outside of their fragmentary state, with much of the body suffering from moderate corrosion resulting in a green-grey patina, with an area of blue corrosion on one side of the grip. N.B. Photographs of the pommel in-situ (taken by Yorkshire Archaeological Trust) show that it was attached to a larger (now fragmentary) portion of the sword grip.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Pommel dimensions: 59.4mm by 23.5mm; Hilt length: 23.1mm; Hilt aperture dimensions: 23.9mm by 15.4mm; Weight: 30.44g (Main fragment: 21.01g; left spiral fragments: 2.78g; right spiral fragments: 2.01g; additional fragments 4.64g) N.B the many other probable fragments of the sword hilt (non-joining) have not been included in the weight.\n\n\n\nSpearheads\n\n\n\n2. (SF 22) A copper-alloy spear of uncertain type in multiple fragments. The spear fragments form the upper portion of the spear, including the spear tip; the most substantial fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan, though all original edges that would show the extent of the blades are now missing. The socket is missing. The spear fragment has a circular to oval mid-rib, and the blade surface appears to be flat, although only some of the original surface remains. The remainder of the large spear fragment is in poor condition, and is light green in colour with white, sand like deposits in the corrosion product.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 77.64mm; Width: (at middle) 19.7mm, (at tip) 7.9mm; Diameter of mid-rib; 8.75mm; Blade thickness (at widest point): 3.95mm; Weight (large fragment and moderate blade fragments): 23.21g. NB smaller undiagnostic fragments were not weighed.\n\n\n\n3. (SF 4) A fragment of copper-alloy spear of uncertain type. The spear fragment is formed of the upper portion of the spear, though the tip has broken away and is now absent; the fragment is subsequently trapezoidal in plan. The mid-rib of the spear fragment is sub-circular, with a flat blade surface and a bevelled edge. The fragment is dark green in colour and in a good condition, with a slight hairline crack on one side at the bevelled edge. A series of small, worn depressions are also visible along the mid-rib; it is unclear whether these were a result of manufacture or use.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 31.6mm; Width: (at widest) 32.1 mm, (at smallest) 25.7mm; Weight 9.73g.\n\n\n\nSocketed axes: Yorkshire Type\n\n\n\n4. (SF 13) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1502 (pl. 96), 1472 (pl. 94), 1419 (pl. 92) and 1398 (pl. 91), though SF 13 has longer vertical ribs). The socket mouth is rectangular in plan with an everted collar, and with a horizontal moulding below. A small circular indentation resulting from a casting error can be seen in the collar (diameter 3.3mm). From the moulding, three vertical diverging decorative ribs extend on both faces of the axe; the partial loss of one face has removed some of this detail. The side loop, also springing from the moulding, is complete with a 'D' shaped aperture. Below the moulding the body of the axe tapers slightly outwards to a fragmentary and chipped wedge-shaped cutting edge. The axe has a mid green colour overall, with areas of lighter green where the original surface has been lost.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 78.5mm; Socket width: 38.9mm by 37.5mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 4.75mm-6.9mm; Blade width: 42.3mm; Loop: 17mm by 9.7mm, internal dimensions: 10.2mm by 4.3mm; Weight: 153g.\n\n\n\n5. (SF 16) A near complete cast copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1403 (pl. 91), 1471-3 (pl. 94), though SF 16 has longer ribs). The socket mouth is square in plan with an everted collar of uneven thickness, and a horizontal moulding below. From this moulding three slightly divergent decorative ribs extend, with the two exterior ribs sitting at the transition between the face and the face edge. The axe retains a side loop with a 'D' shaped aperture; however extensive active corrosion has partially blocked this aperture. A small portion of the blade tip is missing, with the original cutting edge still present. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. This axe has a light to mid green patina beneath extensive soil coverage.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 79.8mm; Socket width: 38.4mm by 37.4mm; Wall thickness: 5.4mm-5.7mm (4.55mm at loop side); Side loop length: 20mm; loop width: 11.2mm. Blade width: 44.5mm; Weight 177g.\n\n\n\n6. (SF 2) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type in three fragments (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1419 (pl. 92) and 1512 (pl. 96). The body of the axe is largely complete with slight losses to the socket mouth; two additional small fragments complete this. The axe has an everted collar, now fragmentary and uneven, with a horizontal moulding below. Three decorative ribs extend from this moulding; these are parallel, with the two exterior ribs positioned inwards away from the side-face of the axe. On one side of the axe a complete loop springs from the moulding. The lower portion of the axe consists of an expanded, slightly flared blade; this is broadly complete with a slight hemispherical in plan loss in the centre of the cutting edge of the blade. Additional losses to the original surface on one face and one side of the axe are visible, with an emphasis at the blade portion of the axe; these exhibit a light green colour, whilst the remainder of the axe body has a mid-to dark green patina and fair condition. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 81.9mm; Socket dimensions: 37.1mm by 36.8mm; Loop dimensions: 17.7mm by 6.2mm, internal loop dimensions: 10.3mm by 5.1mm; Weight: 143.59g (No soil)\n\n\n\n7. (SF 3) A copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1503 (pl. 96), 1526 (pl. 97), 1536 (pl. 98). The axe is incomplete in that it is missing the uppermost everted collar at the square in plan socket mouth. The horizontal moulding remains, and from this three parallel decorative ribs extend on both faces of the axe. A complete side loop also springs from the moulding; this appears to have been miscast due to its uneven dimensions and finish. The body of the axe continues to a complete wedge-shaped cutting edge; there is one slight loss to the original surface on one face. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. The axe is of a very fine condition and displays a mid-green shiny patina.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 84.2mm; Socket width: 33.2mm by 33mm; Side loop dimensions: length 20.2mm, width 9.7mm, internal diameter 11.4mm by 6.2mm; Blade width: 43.5mm; Weight: 154g (No soil).\n\n\n\n8. (SF 10 and SF 8) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1361 and 1367 (pl. 89) in two fragments; one socket mouth and body fragment (SF 10), and a lower body and blade fragment (SF 8). The first fragment is formed of a square in plan socket with an everted collar, below which a horizontal moulding is visible; a complete but uneven side loop springs from this moulding. On both faces of the upper axe fragment are three decorative ribs; these slightly diverge, with the two exterior ribs on both faces positioned at the exterior edge of the axe body. Casting seams are retained on both sides of this axe fragment, and across the side loop. The secondary fragment is rectangular at the socket and flares slightly to a near complete blade cutting edge; it is slightly rounded with just one slight chip at the side to face transition.\n\n\n\nThere is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade.\n\n\n\nIn the centre of both fragments at the point at which they join is a pressure point resulting from external force; this pressure has resulted in the axe separating into the two fragments. The wall thickness at this point on both fragments is distinctly irregular, with the face that has suffered the compression significantly thinner than the opposite face of the axe; this may be indicative of the axe being heated prior to being forcefully split into two.\n\n\n\nBoth fragments are a mid-green grey in colour, although the face which has suffered compression has areas of light green corrosion suggestive of its close proximity to another corroded item in the ground.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 90.3mm; Socket width: 38.7 by 39.3mm; Socket wall thickness: 6.1mm-7mm; Side loop dimensions: length 18mm, width 9.6mm, loop diameter 9.2mm by 5.4mm; Blade width 48.9mm ; Weight 190g (lower blade fragment has no soil).\n\n\n\n9. (SF 18 and SF 8 associated) A small copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type in two fragments; one small fragment comprises part of the socket mouth and side face (SF 8 associated), whilst the larger fragment spans the whole length of the object, with a narrow portion of the socket mouth preserved through to the blade tip (SF 18). The socket mouth is rectangular in plan with both fragments preserving part of the everted collar and the horizontal moulding. A side loop (part of which is retained on each fragment) springs from this moulding, along with three divergent ribs on each face. Casting seams are retained on either side of the axe. The blade is slightly flared and the cutting egde of the blade is complete, with moderate soil covering the surface of the axe; it has a mid-green patina beneath this.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 64mm; Socket wall thickness: 5.15mm; Blade width: 38.2mm. Weight: 58.08g (large fragment 53.35g, small fragment: 4.74g).\n\n\n\n10. (SF 17) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type. The fragment is 'L' shaped in plan, comprising a portion of one face and one side; the completed socket is likely to have been rectangular to square in section. The fragment retains a pronounced everted collar at the socket mouth with a horizontal moulding below; one single vertical cast decorative rib is visible on the face. Traces of a casting seam are also visible on the side. This fragment has a light green colour overall and moderate corrosion product.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 39.5mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 5.8mm-8.5mm; Width 24.8mm; Weight 27.4g.\n\n\n\n11. (SF 19) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain, but possible Yorkshire type. The fragment is formed of the upper portion of the axe at the socket mouth, with the lower blade portion now absent. It has a rectangular in plan socket with an everted collar, with a horizontal moulding beneath this. Casting seams are visible on either side of the axe and a complete side loop is also retained. One face of the axe has suffered considerable pressure to its exterior surface, resulting in a moderate depression where the axe wall has been forced inwards. The axe has a mid-green colour overall with moderate soil covering.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 33.6mm; Socket width: 44.5mm by 35.9mm; Loop dimensions: 20.2mm by 8.9mm, internal loop dimensions: 11.2mm by 6.7mm; Weight: 47g.\n\n\n\nEverthorpe type\n\n\n\n12. (SF 7) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Everthorpe type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess, 1317 and 1320 (pl. 87). The socket mouth is square in plan, with an unevenly cast everted collar; below this a horizontal moulding is visible from which a complete side loop springs. From this moulding the body of the axe continues in a straight form, before flaring slightly to the blade; the cutting edge of the blade is complete aside from a few small removals resulting from corrosion. The body of the axe is plain with casting seams retained on both sides and across the side loop. It has a mid to dark green grey colour and is in good condition overall, with a slight soil covering.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 92.9mm; Socket dimensions: 36.7mm by 35.8mm; Wall thickness: c. 5.7mm-6mm; Loop dimensions: length 18.9mm; width 9.7mm; Blade width: 45.7mm; Weight: 182g.\n\n\n\n13. (SF 5) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Everthorpe type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess: 1320 (pl. 87). The axe is sub-circular (square with rounded corners) in plan at the mouth, with an everted collar and horizontal moulding below. From this a complete side loop springs. The body of the axe is narrowed before flaring slightly to the blade tip; the cutting edge of the blade is uneven and incomplete. One casting seam is retained, the other is visible where the original surface of the axe remains. The surface of the axe is uneven and much of the original surface has been lost through corrosion, resulting in a light green colour overall. Additional corrosion product is visible inside the socket within the retained soil; it is not certain whether this is the remains of a secondary object or if the corrosion material relates to SF 5.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 85.3mm; Socket dimensions: 36.2mm by 33.4mm; Wall thickness: 4.8mm; Loop dimensions: length 18.4mm, width 8.4, internal aperture 11.3mm by 6mm; Weight: 145g.\n\n\n\n14. (SF 14) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type. The socket mouth is square in plan (with rounded corners) with an everted collar; below this is a horizontal moulding. A moderate sub-triangular in plan removal can be seen at the socket (resulting from the extensive corrosion of the metal); this has also lead to further cracking down the face. The body of the socketed axe is plain and is fairly straight, though it flares out moderately to the cutting edge of the blade; this is nearly complete with a few slight losses. A single casting seam retained on either side; a pronounced seam is also visible at the loop. The side loop is complete with a 'D' shaped aperture, currently filled with soil. The axe retains further soil inside the socket, with additional soil on all external surfaces. It has a dark green patina beneath this soil covering.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 91.6mm; Socket width: 36.2mm; Socket wall thickness: 5.3mm; Loop dimensions: length 19mm, width 10.5mm; Weight: 169g.\n\n\n\n15. (SF 9) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type (cf Schmidt and Burgess 1307 (pl. 86). The socket is sub-rectangular in plan with an unevenly cast everted collar; a moderate section of this collar is missing on one face of the axe. A worn horizontal moulding is also visible beneath this collar, from which a complete side loop springs; this side loop is uneven from casting. The body of the axe is broadly straight beneath the moulding, expanding in width slightly towards the lower portion of the axe, before flaring substantially to the blade. The cutting edge of the blade is incomplete with losses at both the tip and on both side faces. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. The body of the axe retains cast seams on both sides and across the side loop. It has a mid green colour and slightly mottled surface, with a number of small hairline cracks visible on both faces; these have resulted in small areas of loss of the original surface at the blade tip and on one side face.\n\n\n\nThe axe has been poorly cast, with a number of small apertures appearing as a result. These are visible beneath the socket collar, on the side face near the side loop and two further indentations can be seen on one face of the body. The diameters range from c.2.2mm-2.9mm.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 91.5mm; Socket dimension: 37.4mm by 37.9mm (with fragment missing); Wall thickness: c. 3.8mm-6.3mm; Blade width: 48mm; Loop dimensions: length 19mm; width 10mm; internal diameter: 9.4 by 5.8mm; Weight: 133g (no soil).\n\n\n\n16. (SF 1) An incomplete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type (cf Schmidt and Burgess 1308 (pl.86). The socket is sub-rectangular in plan with a pronounced everted collar, below which a horizontal moulding is visible. From the moulding an incomplete side loop springs; the lower portion of the loop is now missing. The axe has broadly straight slides and a slight flare at the blade; the blade tip is incomplete, with a moderate loss to one side. The body of the axe retains cast seams on both sides, but is otherwise plain. The original surface of the axe has been partially lost through extensive corrosion, such that the axe now appears a light green colour with a mottled and unevenly textured surface.\n\n\n\nWithin the socket of this axe is a fragment of a secondary item, probably a socketed axe socket, still retained within moderate soil. This fragment has an everted collar and might have once been rounded in plan at the socket.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 82.9mm, length including internal fragment: 90.3mm; Socket dimensions: 38mm by 36.4mm; Loop dimensions: length 9.1mm, width 7.7mm; Weight: 195g.\n\n\n\nMeldreth variant Aylsham type\n\n\n\n17. (SF 15) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Meldreth, variant Aylsham type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1233 (pl. 83). The socket mouth is circular to square in plan, with an everted collar, and a horizontal moulding at the transition from the socket to the body of the axe. The body of the axe is narrowed and faceted (8 very slight facets), and expands to a flared blade. The blade is now damaged so that the original cutting edge of the blade is missing; further triangular in plan losses are also visible to either side of the blade. This axe retains two prominent casting seams, one down each side, with a complete, though slightly off-cast side loop. It has a mid-green patina beneath the soil covering.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 89.6mm ; Socket dimensions: 32.5mm by 30.2mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 3.9mm-5.8mm; Loop dimensions: length 19.5mm; width 6.9mm, internal diameter 10.2mm by 4.7mm; Blade width: 43.7mm; Weight: 90g.\n\n\n\nAlford type\n\n\n\n18. (SF 11) An incomplete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable type Alford (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 188-89), although with some comparisons among type Dowris (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 198-9; cf. Eogan's Group 11 (2000, 86-7), although the slightly moulded collar suggests it is more likely to belong to the former. The socket mouth is sub-circular in plan; a complete loop springs from the collar on one side. Within the socket mouth two internal haft seams are visible, with one projecting from each interior face. The body of the axe extends with straight sides for a short length, before flaring significantly to the blade; the blade is now incomplete with much of the original extent missing. Casting seams are visible down both exterior side faces. The axe has a slightly moulded rim. The axe has a mid-green colour overall with moderate corrosion product on the exterior surfaces.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 52.6mm; Socket dimensions: 29.9mm by 27.2mm; Loop dimensions: width 6.7mm, length: 15.3mm, internal aperture: 6.95mm by 3.4mm; Weight: 52.61g.\n\n\n\nUnknown type\n\n\n\n19. (SF 20) A copper-alloy socketed axe fragment of uncertain type, which has been reheated and compressed prior to deposition. This fragment is sub-lozengical in plan, and has a 'figure of 8' section resulting from the application of pressure which has forced the centre of each face inward. The fragment is irregular at both vertical ends (where the socket mouth and blade would have been) with one end of the fragment displaying an 'L' shaped removal. Visible at this removal is a fragment of a secondary copper-alloy object now situated within the first fragment; this secondary fragment has an everted collar and slight curvature to its profile, and is probably a fragment of a socketed tool or axe. The original form of the exterior axe is unclear due to its reworking, though a small aperture resulting from the initial casting of the object is visible to one side. The fragment has a dark green-grey colour overall with areas of blue corrosion product now visible on its surface.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length (at longest point): 45.6mm; Width: 38.6mm-38.9mm; Thickness (of compressed mass): 12.9mm; Thickness (of walls): 3-3.4mm; Weight: 77.19g.\n\n\n\n20. (SF 6) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain type, comprising the lower portion of the axe blade and blade tip. The fragment has a rectangular in plan socket and wedge-shaped cutting edge; this is incomplete and appears heavily rounded and worn at one side. It has a mid-green colour overall and fair patina, although some portions of the original surface at the upper edge have been lost as a result of corrosion.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 46.1mm; Socket: 29.2mm by 16.2mm; Wall thickness: 1.9mm; Weight: 57g (no soil).\n\n\n\n21. (SF 12) Two fragments of a small copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain type; one small socket mouth fragment and a larger blade portion. The axe has a rectangular in plan socket with an everted collar, (visible on the small fragment) with a horizontal moulding below, (visible on the uppermost portion of the lower fragment, at the join to the small mouth fragment). An incomplete side loop is also retained, with a casting seam visible down the opposing side. The cutting edge is wedge-shaped and incomplete, with a slight loss to the original surface. Both fragments have a light green patina overall with several notable hairline cracks on the surface, and the socket contains moderate soil.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 63.2mm; blade width: 32.2mm; Weight: 49.04g\n\n\n\n22. (SF 21) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of unknown type. The fragment forms the partial remains of one side or face of the axe, with slight curvature towards one edge representing the original corner of the socketed form. The fragment retains a moderate uneven collar and has a dark green colour overall.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 32.8mm; Width: 37.9mm; Weight: 22.96g.\n\n\n\nAssociated but non-joining fragments\n\n\n\n23 - 28. (SF 1 associated) A further six fragments were reported with SF 1 which do not appear to fit with this particular item but which are undoubtedly from the assemblage as a whole. 4 of the fragments appear to have come from the collar of one (or more) socketed axes, whilst the two other 2 fragments of thin walled, curved copper-alloy, might possibly belong with the sword hilt.\n\n\n\n1) Expanded collar with cast seam. Dimensions: 15.8mm by 16.6mm; Weight: 1.57g.\n\n\n\n2) Everted collar. Dimensions: 15.9mm by 8.25; Weight: 1.05g.\n\n\n\n3) Everted and slightly curved collar. Dimensions: 20.5mm by 12.2mm; Weight: 2.12g.\n\n\n\n4) Everted collar. Dimensions: 22.7mm by 10.4mm; Weight: 2.4g.\n\n\n\n5) Curved possible sword hilt fragment. Dimensions: 16.9mm by 9.1mm; Weight: 1.68g.\n\n\n\n6) Curved possible sword hilt fragment. Dimensions: 20.4mm by 16mm; Thickness: 1.7mm; Weight: 1.02g.\n\n\n\n29. (SF 5 associated) Grouped with SF 5 from excavation is another fragment of a socketed axe. The fragment is 'L' shaped in plan and comprises the upper portion the axe, with a portion of the everted collar, face and side face with a near complete side loop. The fragment is dark green-grey in colour with areas of extensive light blue corrosion product. The slight remains of the face appear to indicate compression similar to SF 10, 8 and 19. This fragment does not fit with SF 5 but belongs with another, as yet unidentified axe.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 23.3mm by 17.6mm; collar thickness: 3.95; Weight: 15g.\n\n\n\n30. (SF 7 associated) A secondary fragment of an everted collar from a square in plan socketed axe was associated with this find from excavation, but which is certainly from another, currently unidentified, axe. Dimensions: 21.7mm by 8.2mm; Weight: 1.83g.\n\n\n\n31. (SF 9 associated) A further very small fragment, possibly from a handle was also found with this axe. It does not fit with SF 9 and thus belongs with another unidentified axe.\n\n\n\n32. (SF 10 associated) Grouped with SF 10 from excavation is a small fragment, possibly an everted collar, of a socketed axe. Dimensions: 16.8mm by 16.5mm; Weight: 2.13g.\n\n\n\n33. (SF 10 associated) Nine small copper-alloy fragments. All are thin and curved in plan, and are thus likely to belong to the fragmentary and incomplete sword hilt (SF 23). Dimensions: combined weight 3.52g.\n\n\n\nSeveral additional fragments were recovered from the spoil during excavation. These have not been described or weighed but are almost certainly associated with the hoard, and thus ought to be considered potential treasure.\n\n\n\nNot associated objects\n\n\n\n34. (No SF) A fragment of a copper-alloy object of uncertain form, possibly a handle. The fragment is rectangular in plan with a slight curvature in section. One end shows signs of attachment with raised copper-alloy material on both surfaces and a slight recession to the top. The upper surface has two pronounced raised vertical ridges whilst the underside is plain (aside from two bulbous lumps at the attachment end). The fragment has a light green to red/brown colour.\n\n\n\nThis fragment is similar in appearance to vessel handles of Medieval date, and was recovered from an area outside of the closed Bronze Age hoard deposit. As it does not appear be of Bronze Age date or from the hoard this artefact should not be considered as an associated find and is therefore not treasure.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 53.8mm; Width: 30.5mm; Thickness: 6.95mm (at ridge), 4.8mm (in recession); Weight: 59.27g.\n\n\n\n35. A sub-lozengical fragment of black glazed Medieval to Modern sherd. The fabric is stoneware, and grey in colour, with glaze on both surfaces. Relief decoration is also visible on the exterior surface, with two raised circular forms and a series of cross-hatch detailing.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 21.5mm by 21.3mm; Weight: 2.18g.\n\n\n\n36 - 38. Three small flints. These are white-grey in colour and do not appear to be worked. They are therefore not likely to be associated.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThe Cherry Burton hoard comprises of objects that are relatively common in Late Bronze Age British hoards of the Ewart Park phase (c.950-800 cal BC), which typically consist of complete and fragmentary swords, spearheads and socketed axeheads. The socketed axe types are well known from Northern England, with the type Yorkshire axes that make up the majority, very well represented in East Yorkshire, as the terminology would suggest (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223-39), furthermore, the probable type Alford axe (No. 18) is possibly related to the type Yorkshire group (Ibid., 188) The spearhead fragments are too fragmentary to type but Late Bronze Age spearheads are well known in the region (Davis 2012), including in hoards with socketed axeheads (e.g. the Bilton hoard, Yorkshire: ibid., pl. 151). In these respects the hoard is typical of the period and region. However, a number of points warrant additional comment.\n\n\n\nThe first point concerns the presence of an antennae sword pommel (No. 1) from a solid-hilted Late Bronze Age sword with Continental comparisons (Antennenschwerter: Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, 122-3). To date only eight other swords of this type have been recorded in Britain (Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, nos. 751-5; Needham 1987; PAS find: SUSS-761CD0; Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 327-8); of which only one example in a museum collection is complete (from the River Witham, Lincolnshire: Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, no. 751), the other complete example is the (lost) sword from the Isle of Skye, known only from antiquarian records and an illustration (Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 327-8, fig. 28.5). The remaining six swords are in a fragmentary condition. The Cherry Burton example is paralleled by four other cases in which the sword has been broken through the grip, but it does not otherwise appear to resemble closely any of the other antennae swords found in Britain. The fragmentary state of the Cherry Burton pommel also hinders detailed comparison with Continental forms.\n\n\n\nThe Cherry Burton pommel may not be the first discovery of this sword type from Yorkshire. The example from the British Museum collection (1858, 1116.1) listed by Colquhoun & Burgess (1981, no. 754) as coming from 'Provenance unknown' (but actually from either Yorkshire or the River Thames) lacks its antennae pommel. The British Museum's acquisitions register for 1858 details that this find was made in Yorkshire. This statement predates the posthumous publication of Kemble's Horae Ferales in 1863, in which he notes that the sword was already in the collection of British Museum but suggests it was found in the Thames (Kemble 1863, 162). The confusion could be due to the next entry in the British Museum register being a find that was from the bed of the Thames (the two entries are given one above the other). If the register had been misread then this could be the cause of the confusion, but the posthumous editing of Horae Ferales by usually diligent R.G. Latham and A.W. Franks suggest that this cannot be taken for granted and some doubt must remain. Nevertheless, the distribution of the known British antennae sword pommels is generally eastern and the Cherry Burton pommel corresponds to the pattern in this respect. This also corresponds with Cowie & O'Connor's suggestion that the British antennae pommel swords have Nordic rather than Central European connections.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the elaborate spirals of the River Witham sword, the Cherry Burton 'spirals' are in fact solid loops.\n\n\n\nIts simplicity is paralleled by the examples from Near Lewes, Sussex (SUSS-761CD0), Chertsey (Needham 1987, fig. 5.15, 1) and the find from Snettisham ('hoard IV') (Coombs 1974; Pendleton 199, no. 1677). This muted feature does occur on swords from the Continent, including a sword from Munich, Germany (e.g. Quillfeldt 1995: Taf. 75, no. 219), but seems to be a more recurrent trend among the - albeit small - number of known British examples (cf. O'Connor & Cowie's point regarding the lack of exact Continental parallels for the British antennae pommel swords: 2007, 328). The parallel with the Snettisham 'hoard IV' find is worth pursuing further: it was one of the fragments broken through the grip and was found in direct association with objects of Ewart Park date (including socketed axes) that had, as at Cherry Burton, been intentionally damaged and fragmented. Both the Snettisham and Cherry Burton hoards included an example of a socketed axe with another object blocking its socket. The Cherry Burton hoard therefore helps to strengthen the case for placing antennae pommel swords in the context of the Ewart Park complex (cf. Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 328).\n\n\n\nA further notable feature of the Cherry Burton hoard is the purposeful damage to several axes (Nos. 8, 11, 16, 19 & 30 in the catalogue). The range of evidence compression, the possible application of heat and the presence of axe fragments blocking the socket of another axe. This prevalence of this type of treatment in Late Bronze Age hoards from across Europe has been discussed recently by Mörtz (forthcoming) and could be related to recycling or more ritualized decommissioning prior to deposition. The prevalence and character of this treatment deserves greater attention in future research and studies.\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\nLucy Ellis\n\n\n\nAssistant Treasure Registrar, British Museum\n\n\n\nContribution by\n\n\n\nNeil Wilkin\n\n\n\nCurator, British Museum\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\n\nThanks are due to Dr Brendan O'Connor for comments on an earlier draft of this report.
