The axe is 114mm long and is missing the butt end. The break appears to be ancient. The blade is 84mm wide. The axe is plain with no side flanges but the sharp edges of the blade are missing due to corrosion.\n\n\nThe axe is of Early Bronze Age date (c. 2350 - 2050 BC). This example fits best into the earliest known copper axe and early bronze axes discovered in Britain. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age of metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.
