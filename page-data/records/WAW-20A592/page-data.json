In plan the spearhead is an elongated sub-trapezoid as the tip is missing. Both these breaks are not recent. There are traces of the blade facets but these are heavily abraded, therefore the spear blades cutting edges have been lost. The overall shape of the blade can be possibly ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The spearhead fragment is broadly triangular in plan and in section a sub-lozenge. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has a mottled dark green coloured patina which is incomplete and pitted. It measures 21.94mm long, 7.24mm wide, 4.9mm thick and weighs 2.09g.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spearhead dates to the Middle or Late Bronze Age date (1500 - 800 BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.32121533","fourFigureLon":"-0.72498962","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2012","datefound2":"October 19, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Harrowden","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Wellingborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"21.94"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
