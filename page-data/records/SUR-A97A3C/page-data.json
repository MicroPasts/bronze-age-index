The chisel has a tang with a rectangular cross section which has broken at a transverse collar. This collar is 14.3mm wide and circular in cross-section, tapering at either end to give it a barrel-shaped form. The blade itself expands from a narrow neck, 9.5mm wide, curving outwards to become 24.9mm wide to where it ends with concave breaks on either side. The side profile of the blade tapers towards these breaks.","fourFigureLat":"51.21838612","fourFigureLon":"-0.26883692","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Betchworth","county":"Surrey","district":"Mole Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURA97A3C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"39.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
