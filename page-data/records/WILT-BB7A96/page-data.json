It measures 25.40 x 26.23 x 4.23mm and weighs 11.29g.\nThe fragment is curving in profile and comprises part of the face and part of the side of a round-mouthed socketed axehead. The surface is rather silvery in appearance suggesting an inclusion of tin in the bronze. At the side the lip is no more than a wide rib, but above the face it projects 5.4mm. The break runs across the ribs so it is impossible to tell whether they ended in pellets. The break is rather jagged in places and ancient.","fourFigureLat":"51.077943","fourFigureLon":"-1.701608","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"November 14, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.23","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pitton and Farley","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/DMjan06BA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society","length":"25.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
