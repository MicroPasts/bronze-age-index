The fragment is sub-rectangular in shape the butt and a fragment of the flanged sides survive. The axe has an angular butt and the sides gradually widen towards the break. Both sides of the palstave have high developed flanges, which increase gradually from the butt to from sub-triangular sides. \n\n\n\nThe faces of the axe fragment are slightly concave, creating a H-shaped cross-section. The faces of the axe show signs of wear, such as scratches and the break is even and patinated, suggesting that the object was broken in antiquity. Due to the fragmentary nature of the object, it is difficult to confidently assign a Type.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 28.55mm in length, 26.8mm wide, 18.1mm thick and weighs 32.37 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.09630322","fourFigureLon":"-2.02993828","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Richard Henry","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Richard Henry","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Teffont","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT026A8D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"28.55"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
