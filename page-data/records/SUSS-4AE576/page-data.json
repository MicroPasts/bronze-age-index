The fragment is sub-rectangular in shape and represents the end of the palstave, with the beginnings of the side-flanges. An old break is visible on the end that would have led to the rest of the object. It is in poor condition, with significant surface pitting and corrosion; the metal is light green in colour. The fragment measures 32.9mm long, 24.6 mm wide and 11.2mm thick and weighs 27.7 grams.","fourFigureLat":"50.86978611","fourFigureLon":"0.14459719","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Liz Walker","datefound1":"May 30, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Liz Walker","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chalvington with Ripe","county":"East Sussex","district":"Wealden","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS-4AE576.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"32.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
