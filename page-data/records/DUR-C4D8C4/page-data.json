The side flanges are low and are at their highest in the central point of the handle. At this central point the handle is also thickest, with a small raised horizontal ridge just visible. The blade is semi-circular and at its widest point measures 84.91mm wide. It still narrows to a thin cutting edge all along the blade edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is almost complete with just the butt and blade edges being slightly uneven. It has a mainly even brown patina although there are a few small patches of green (corrosion). On both sides of the blade and at the top of the haft there are small hollows, possibly from problems during casting but possibly also corrosion damage.","fourFigureLat":"54.223788","fourFigureLon":"-1.526033","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"July 31, 2010","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.59","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kirklington-cum-Upsland","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/frances/DUR-C4D8C4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"137.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
