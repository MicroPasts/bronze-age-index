The butt (with a width of 24.0mm and a thickness of 5.0mm) is straight and is slightly angled. The sides are straight and near-parallel to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 26.2mm, where the axe has a depth of 31.6mm). Below the stop (13mm below) both sides have a transverse rib or nicked-sides. The sides are moderately divergent beneath the nicks, producing a comparatively narrow and unexpanded blade edge (with a blade width of 52.0mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly finished. The flanges rise from the butt and have a straight top edge, the tops are now truncated but probably reached their maximum heights above the stop (16mm above the stop and with a maximum surviving height of 29.7mm). The septum is flat and is near-perpendicular to the flanges and stops (with heights of 11.4mm and 12.9mm). The stops have a slight curve across their width and are very slightly under-cut. The stops are also raised above the faces (with a height of 8.6mm and a thickness of 4.0mm - 6.8mm). The flanges extend onto the faces (for 20mm), before converging together as a shield moulding, enclosing a shallow depression. Both faces also have a midrib beginning below the stop and forming a trident decoration with the shield. The faces have a sub-rectangular section but slightly convex and with a midrib.  There is no obvious blade facet on the unexpanded edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina, which has laminated to a mid-brown surface above a green-brown surface.\n\n\n\nThis palstave does not closely correspond with the two subtypes proposed by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) but is closer to their Type Acton Park but is considerably smaller than most palstaves of the type and also has a trident decoration, rather than a shield. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
