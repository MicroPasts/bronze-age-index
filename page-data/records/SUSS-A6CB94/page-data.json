The palstave has a broad cutting edge that has some worn chipped dammage to the blade. This tapers down towards the butt of the axe, levelling out at the mid point of the object. There is a rib running down towards the blade from the middle of the piece on both sides, this rib tapers out about halfway to the edge. The butt end of the palstave has an H shaped section with two deep recesses running towards the butt. The flanges are broad and oval in shape. Running the length of the object on the top and bottom sides is a casting seam from the mould. The object has a mottled dark and light green patination. The dark green is almost grey perhaps suggesting a high tin content.\n\n\n\nLength: 149.48mm\nWidth: 54.38mm\nThickness: 18.46mm\nWeight: 380g","fourFigureLat":"51.0953641","fourFigureLon":"-1.53013441","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edwin Wood","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edwin Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.46","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Houghton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/PalstaveSUSSA6CB94.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"149.48"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
