The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade that tapers towards the tip and bevelled wings that gradually expand from the tip before tapering inwards towards the socketed shaft. The wing edges are very worn and damaged in several places, and a circular cross-sectional rib extends from tip to base. \n\n\n\nThe shaft is broken where it connects to the head. It is broadly sub-conical in shape, being square in cross-section beneath the head before transitioning gradually to circular in cross-section as it increases in diameter towards the open-ended terminal. There are small loops either side of the shaft, each measuring 13mm in length and with perforations 3mm long. A circular hole perforates the body of the shaft next to one of the loops and there is a parallel semi-circular notch of damage extending into the lower edge of the socketed terminal.\n\n\n\nThe spear has an even dark-brown patina with small patches of green where pitting occurs across both faces of the blade and the body of the socket.\n\n\n\nThe spear, when conjoined, measures 79mm in length. The blade is 16mm wide, a maximum of 7mm thick at the axial ridge and 1.2mm thick along the blade edge. The socketed shaft is 7.5mm wide and thick underneath the head. The socketed terminal is 15.6mm diameter and 1.8mm thick.\n\n\n\nThis looped spearhead is part of the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions and is dated to the Middle Bronze Age between c. 1500 - 1150BC. The several similar spearheads of this type recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database includes IOW-E56A3F from Calbourne on the Isle of Wight, and BH-FB08EE from Cople, Bedford.","fourFigureLat":"51.67134075","fourFigureLon":"-0.51193437","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"January 01, 2018","datefound2":"December 31, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"15.6","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chenies","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Chiltern","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH33B8C2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"79"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
