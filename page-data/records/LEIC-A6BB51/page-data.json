Although both moulds fit together well and their interiors match, the exteriors have different protrusion patterns.\n\n\n\n1a. The back-face of a copper alloy axe mould (Type Welby) extensively coated in dried earth (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3). The visible areas of metal are a matte red/brown on the outside and dark grey/green on the inside. The mould exterior has two rectangular protrusions 7.6mm in length positioned centrally close to the socket end between two 84mm long lines of circular protrusions. These are 2.7mm in diameter and spaced between 7mm and 8.7mm apart.\n\n\n\nThe interior of the mould contains semi-circular, double- mouthed axe recesses above three rib indentations with the loop recess developing from the lower mouth. The coating of dried mud makes it difficult to ascertain the length of the rib recesses beyond 30mm. Max length: 139mm; max. width: 61mm; impression area length: 113mm; impression area width at blade: 45mm; impression area width at loop: 43mm; impression area width at mouth: 34mm: impression area maximum depth at mouth: 19.7mm; weight 245.1g 1b. Front-face of a copper alloy axe mould (Type Welby) with large areas of the red, brown metal still covered in dried earth (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3). The exterior surface is damaged in the centre at the socket end above two rectangular protrusions 7.6mm in length. These are positioned centrally between two, 91mm long lines of circular protrusions. These are 2.7mm in diameter and spaced between 7mm and 8.7mm apart. Another circular rivet is centred between the lines close to the blade end of the mould. The visible interior of the mould is a mirror image of 1a (above) containing semi circular, double mouthed axe recesses with the loop recess developing from the lower mouth. A thick coating of dried earth obliterates the view of the rib and blade area. Max length: 145mm; max. width: 63mm; impression area length: 113mm; impression area width at blade: 45mm; impression area width at loop: 44.2mm; impression area width at mouth: 38.7mm: impression area maximum depth at mouth :19.7mm; weight 279.1g","fourFigureLat":"52.711669","fourFigureLon":"-1.157717","fromdate":"-1020","todate":"-800","notes":"Part of the Rothley Hoard other items can be found at LEIC-A67B11 LEIC-A665D7 and LEIC-4F6B02\n\n\n\nThe copper alloy axe moulds are for the manufacture of Type Welby socketed axes as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, 221-3) and date to the EwartPark period (1020-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age (Needham et al. 1997). Their discovery location in Leicestershire is approximately ten miles west of the Welby hoard find site described by Smith (1957, 24, fig.4). Such axe moulds are rare but this can be compared to the mould from Roseberry Topping, Yorkshire (Type Sompting) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 243),It is possible that the copper alloy socketed axe of the Welby Type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, 205) may have been made in this mould though until further cleaning there is no way of evaluating this any further.\n\n\n\nBen Roberts.\n\n\n\nMinutes from the Treasure Valuation Committee meeting where this case was seen are available here.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ben Roberts","datefound1":"May 23, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"2","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rothley","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Charnwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/A6BB51b.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"145"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
