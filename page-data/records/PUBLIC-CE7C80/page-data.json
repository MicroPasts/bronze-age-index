Similar object have been found and dated to the Bronze Age and Iron Age through to the Roman period. \n\n\n\nThe object had a shiny dark green patina and it was clear to see the terminal ends had some etch decoration. It is circular and comprised of a single wire shaped into three coils. Unfortunately, over time out of the ground the patina has started to flake off very easily leaving what appears to be a tarnished and pitted finish in a lighter grey colour.\n\n\n\nSimilar records:\n\n\n\nSUR-590F5D\n\nSF-4497E7\n\nSWYOR-50CC3C\n\nPUBLIC-33D35F\n\n\n\nWeight: 29.46g\n\n\n\nOuter Diameter: 35mm","fourFigureLat":"52.68292025","fourFigureLon":"-0.93637859","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Darren White","datefound1":"May 29, 2020","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Darren White","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"35","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Twyford and Thorpe","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Melton","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dazz666/IMG_4988.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
