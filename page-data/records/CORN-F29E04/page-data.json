The blade edge is worn and incomplete so that it is only flanged on one side. The broken edge reveals an oblong aperture which is the end of the socket for the haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has mostly corroded away and there are patches of light green bronze disease. There is not enough detail to precisely date this fragment within the Late Bronze Age, but some comparanda are offered below.\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar broken blade fragment from Blandford, Dorset on page 607, Plate 46, No.348d, which is associated with rib and pellet socketed axes of the Ewart Park period c.900-800 BC.\n\n\nNeedham and Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar flanged blade on a 'South-eastern type' socketed axe on page 136, Fig.38, No.334, which is dated from the Ewart Park phase also.","fourFigureLat":"50.144246","fourFigureLon":"-5.500463","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"October 16, 2011","datefound2":"October 22, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"18","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ludgvan","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Feb12finz 014.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
