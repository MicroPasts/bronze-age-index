The socket is conical and incomplete with part of the reverse section being broken (presumably in antiquity). The surviving socket depth is 27.1 mm. The socket has a circular external as well as internal section. The inner, hollow, part of the socket shows evidence of mineralised wood. The blade extends at the head of the socket and the overal shape is lost due to abrasion all that remains are shallow crescentic fragments. There is no evidence of side loops, although these may well have been lost through movement in the soil. It is further possible that the socket may have had a circular peg hole - but again this is also lost due to the significant damage. The fragment has a well developed brown patina, there is also a small section of brass coloured bare metal evident at the very tip of the object.\n\n\n\nAbrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThe Spearhead measures 97.7 mm long, 17 mm wide, is 9.1 mm thick and weighs 24.9 grams.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is probably too damaged to be specifically attributed to a specific type - however it shares many attributes of the side looped spearheads (of the Acton Park II phase / assemblage) of the Middle Bronze Age as we as that of the pegged spearheads (Penard phases) of the early Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"52.64247843","fourFigureLon":"-1.75019849","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"August 31, 2014","datefound2":"September 29, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wigginton and Hopwas","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMID-34BFC7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"97.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
