The upper fragment has broken through a central rivet hole (of 3.6mm diameter, now 7mm from the damaged hilt top). The blade is thickest (at 10.0mm) across its hilt and appears to have been of rounded, sub-rectangular section. The hilt has lost both sides and therefore the ricasso and beginning of the blade are not evident. On one face there is a clear change of patination from a green-brown dull patina to a dark-brown ‘glossy’ patina. The difference is straight with an apparent step towards the blade edge and may represent a hilt mark. The variable patina is not evident on the other face. The blade is of lenticular section, with a rounded midsection but with a clear blade facet, where it survives on one short section (20mm long, 144mm below the top, where the blade has a width of 27mm and a thickness of 8.6mm). The blade form cannot be determined because of the loss of the blade edges on both sides but there is the impression that the sword narrows before widening again and perhaps, tentatively suggesting a leaf-shaped blade profile. The blade appears to be narrowing towards the lower section and may have been approaching the tip. Despite the considerable peripheral damage to the blade, much of the surface is well-preserved with sharpening striations evident, mostly running along the blade but also diagonally off the blade. There are no grooves evident along the blade. The hilt has deeper short grooves below the patina. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of brown surface loss and powdery, pale-green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe extensive peripheral erosion has removed nearly all the diagnostic features, making typological identification difficult. The comparatively substantial and thick blade would suggest a sword rather than a rapier. Additionally, the surviving rivet hole would further suggest a sword, the earliest sword types which have central rivet holes through the hilt are of Balintober Type, of Middle Bronze Age date and Penard metalworking, c. 1300 – 1150BC but the hilt arrangement continues through the Late Bronze Age, of Wilburton and Ewart Park metalworking, and is also present on Gündligen Swords of Earliest Iron Age date and Llyn Fawr metalworking (c. 800 – 600BC). The majority of swords recovered in both Wales and Britain are of Ewart Park Type (c. 950 – 800BC) and the surviving features are consistent with the type. The extent of the erosion and damage may suggest that the sword was complete when deposited.","fourFigureLat":"51.70948966","fourFigureLon":"-3.30395997","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bedlinog","county":"Merthyr Tydfil","district":"Merthyr Tydfil","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017104new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"418"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
