It has a rectangular cross-section and one half tapers from the centre towards a chisel shape end, while the other half, with a slightly more rounded section, tapers towards a pointed end. It is in good condition, has a dark grey-green colour and a prominent casting seam along both sides of its length. Plain copper alloy awls are hard to date precisely but examples of this form are thought to have been introduced in the Bronze Age and they have barely changed throughout the centuries. They were used as leather and wood working tools.\n\n\n\ncf NLM-48A4AA, DOR-03E430, IOW-DA8A9A.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 57.25mm in length; 3.3mm in width; weight 4.8g","fourFigureLat":"51.11427649","fourFigureLon":"-2.05852178","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Hanbidge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Hanbidge","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"1","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chilmark","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/denisewilding/WILT710D5C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"57.25"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
