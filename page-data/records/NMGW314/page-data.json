BC) (Needham et al. 1997).\n\n\n\nThe spearhead survives in two pieces, broken across the blade-tang junction. It has a long triangular blade bevelled at the edge, with a rounded midrib and (blade wings with) two distinct steps parallel to the edge of the blade. The central mid-rib is filled, on both sides, with rows of pointille (punched dot) decoration. The tip of the blade is missing and the blade edges are damaged. The junction of the tang and blade is demarcated by an undecorated triangular-shaped facet. The rectangular-sectioned unrivetted tang tapers towards an irregular end which curves slightly upwards. The tang is broken close to the junction with the blade; this is an ancient break. The surface of the spearhead is in poor condition and is partly obscured by corrosion deposits. Length 207mm, maximum width 40mm, thickness 10mm, weight 151grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.473737","fourFigureLon":"-3.470011","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"An example of the tanged type of spearhead associated with the Arreton tradition which dates to the latest phases of the Early Bronze Age c.1700-1500 Cal BC (Ehrenberg 1977, 4; Needham 1996, 132-133). It is one of sixteen Type 1B tanged spearheads noted by Davis (2012, 33f.) and is published in his Prahistorische Bronzefunde (Davis 2012, 33, No.29, Plate 3). Two other examples are known from Wales presently (Davis 2012, Nos. 36 and 39). The distribution of tanged spearheads as a whole is concentrated in the south-east of England but examples occur throughout most of Britain and Ireland (Davis 2012, 38; Needham 1979, 7, fig.1.4). It is not possible to make out whether there are scored outlines across the blade-tang junction comparable with those noted on some other tanged spearheads (Needham 1979, 5).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip MacDonald","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"207"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
