Its max.width is 4.77mm and its max.thickness 3.25mm.\n\nFrom a central point rectangular in section and 3.84x3.25mm, the awl narrows in one direction to a squarish sectioned point, 1.43x1.85mm. In the other direction over c.18mm from the centre, it widens and thins to 4.77x2.93mm before narrowing sharply to a pointed end 1.11x1.71mm.\n\nOn one face only and passing the widest point almost to its nearest end and the same distance in the other direction, is a wide and deep groove c.14mm long. On either side, between groove and edge of the object, and particularly towards the middle of the awl, are shallower tiny diagonal incised lines/ light grooves. Pitting does mostly obscure these but it is assumed they continue right around the central groove. At the end of the central groove, towards the middle of the awl, is a pair of transverse grooves. Decoration does not appear to be anywhere else on the awl although pitting and loss of patina does obscure large parts of it.","fourFigureLat":"51.626691","fourFigureLon":"-1.828042","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"June 30, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.25","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Latton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Gillett0709decoratedawl.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"54.65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
