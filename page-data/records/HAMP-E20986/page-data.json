Its cross-section is not immediately suggestive of a Bronze Age object type; it narrows considerably over its relatively small width.","fourFigureLat":"51.077201","fourFigureLon":"-1.487495","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"Other fragments of such antiquity have been found in this parish and recorded on this database.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"August 26, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kings Somborne","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-E20986BAfragment.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"15.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
