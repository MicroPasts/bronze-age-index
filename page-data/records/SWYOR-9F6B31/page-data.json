The axe is 108.8mm long, 48.1mm wide and 12.6mm thick. It thickens in the middle and there are slight flanges, though not large enough to be of significant use. The cutting blade is curved and is wider than the rest of the axe. The butt is thin and tapers to a wide pointed end. The axe is badly pitted with active bronze disease and the thinner edges are chipped. Similar examples can be seen on page 165 and 166 of The National Museum of Wales's \"Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections\" (1980), particularly number 117 which is described as a chisel or flat axe but which is narrower and thinner than this example.","fourFigureLat":"53.39237563","fourFigureLon":"-0.85862604","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"September 16, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Beckingham","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Bassetlaw","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 385 flat axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"108.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
