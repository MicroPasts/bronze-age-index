The fragment has lost all its diagnostic features and so the classification cannot be further refined. The fragment comprises a short section of the spear blade, including the lozenge sectioned central mid-rib and the incomplete blades to either side. There is a slight tapering of the mid rib visible. The rest of the spearhead including all of the socket is missing. The surface is pitted with corrosion, but a shiny brown patina remains over most surfaces.\n\nAlthough only a fragment of the spearhead remains, the mid-rib is high and this is more common on spearheads of Middle Bronze Age date (c. 1600-1001 BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.74273642","fourFigureLon":"-1.52345331","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Chance find during metal detecting","parish":"Lew","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2015476.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"20.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
