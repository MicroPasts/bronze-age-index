Very thin metal. Socket about 1/4mm thick. 2 Rivet holes. Mr. Pritchard writes to L.F. Chitty 31.10.23: \"The 3 broken spearheads (bronze) were found in 1835 during excavations in connection with drainage of Willow Moor Farm. Of course the finder is dead, also his son who kept them in memory of his father; I knew the son casually but can not find out his name. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the specimens. Along with the bronze spearheads was found a stone celt (Knife LFC) also in my possession.\"","fourFigureLat":"52.671204","fourFigureLon":"-2.533816","fromdate":null,"todate":null,"notes":null,"materialTerm":null,"identifier":null,"datefound1":null,"datefound2":null,"subsequentActionTerm":null,"recorder":null,"gridSource":null,"quantity":"NA","height":null,"diameter":null,"edge":"34","thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"","parish":"Little Wenlock","county":"Shropshire","district":"","regionName":null,"country":"England","patina":"Dull rusty brown and grey green","surface":"","other":"Width: blade 34mm; 41mm; Socket 25.5mm,Thickness: blade 12mm; socket 25.5mm,Weight: 70.88 gms","composition":"","associations":"Part of a hoard","publications":"As.
