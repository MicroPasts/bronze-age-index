The palstave is 71.6mm long, with the butt end being rectangular in plan and of largely consistant width, 11.0mm at the stop ridge, the blade exands in width from the stop ridge reaching 18.0mm at the rounded cutting edge, with no wing tips. In profile the blade is of largely consistant thickness, 3.6mm at the midpoint, although tapering to a point at the cutting edge. The palstave flares outwards into the stop ridge, 12.0mm thick, before tapering into the butt, with sub-triangular flanges. a deeply incised slatire is engraved into the lateral face of one flange, with the cuts being patinated. The septum is sub-rectangular and 25.1mm deep, the blade is undecorated.\n\n\n\nOverall dimensions: length 71.6mm; width at cutting edge 18.0mm, at butt 10.6mm; thickness 12.0mm; weight 28.65g.\n\n\n\nAlthough extremely small, a great variation in terms of size is a noted feature of axes of the Bronze Age, with these smaller axes probably being used for lighter woodworking (Moore & Rowlands 1972:13). An incomplete palstave, probably originally around 100mm long and of comparable form is recorded in this database: DEV-669688. Nos. 817 & 874, amongst others, published by Pearce (1984) are similarly short in length, although proportionally they differ.","fourFigureLat":"51.16823946","fourFigureLon":"-2.02998525","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Codford","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEV577913.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"71.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
