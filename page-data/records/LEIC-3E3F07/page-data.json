The object is missing its upper and lower edges and has some corrosion with a blue/green patina. The upper edge is slightly curved and has a central semi circular recess which was probably a circular hole originally. At this point the object is 30mm wide and when viewed in section it tapers from 4mm thick in the centre to just under 1mm at its edge. The object also tapers in width from about one third of its length down, terminating with a broken edge which is 15mm wide. This end also has a tapering section which is the shape of an elongated lozenge. The object is possibly a dagger blade?","fourFigureLat":"52.487052","fourFigureLon":"-1.17674","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"October 04, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gilmorton","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Harborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/3E3F07.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"LCC","length":"74"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
