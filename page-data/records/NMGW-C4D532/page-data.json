At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket, now worn and corroded but probably of sub-rectangular form (29mm wide and with a maximum surviving depth of 2mm). Little of the either side of the axe survives (with a maximum surviving length of 18mm) but the short length are straight and divergent (producing a blade width of 44.9mm and a width of 40.8mm at the break). The blade edge is not expanded and has a gentle curve. (7.1mm deep).  The surviving blade face fragments are convex across their widths and near-straight across their short surviving lengths with no evidence for ribs present on the fragment. The surface is pitted with a corroded dark-brown patina and areas of green corrosion. There are probable casting flaws at the break, which are likely to have weakened the axe.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base would imply a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork. The unexpanded and shallow blade form is consistent with Ewart Park axes of South Wales and similar types.","fourFigureLat":"51.78531859","fourFigureLon":"-2.88571887","fromdate":"-11500","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanarth","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017183new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"25.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
