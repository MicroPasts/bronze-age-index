Only the lower portion of the blade is present, it has broken below the stop ridge. The sides are concave. The cutting edge is lost, but it still retains a convex form.\n\n\n\nThe palstave fragment measures 61.8 mm in length, 41.8 wide (at the blade), 24.8 mm wide (at the break), 16.7 mm thick (at the break) and 6.0 mm thick (at the blade). It weighs 144.8 g.\n\n\n\nThe palstave was tested at Birmingham Museums Trust Conservation Laboratory using a Mistral XRF machine to determine the composition of the alloy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\t\t\t\nCu (%)\n\n\t\t\t\nFe (%)\n\n\t\t\t\nPb (%)\n\n\t\t\t\nSn (%)\n\n\t\t\t\nIn (%)\n\n\t\t\t\nAl (%)\n\n\t\t\n\n\nFront\n\n\t\t\t\n8.07\n\n\t\t\t\n17.46\n\n\t\t\t\n0.40\n\n\t\t\t\n40.60\n\n\t\t\t\n0.12\n\n\t\t\t\n33.34\n\n\t\t\n\n\nBack\n\n\t\t\t\n43.71\n\n\t\t\t\n2.68\n\n\t\t\t\n0.26\n\n\t\t\t\n23.74\n\n\t\t\t\n-\n\n\t\t\t\n29.61\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\nThe palstave fragment is a mid brown to dark green colour, with an even surface patina.
