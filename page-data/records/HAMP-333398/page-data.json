The blade is missing and there is a considerable loss from the socket end. The side loops are large, elongated semicircles, broken at their tops and only perforated towards their bases, the holes within longer recesses. One hole has broken through the side. As implied, the break to the spear occurs towards the tops of the side loops and in a ragged fashion across the shaft, before the blade would have begun. The spear has an oval cross-section. At the base it measures 12.8 by 9.9mm internally; it tapers to 10.5 by 7.9mm at the break. Where it survives the spear has a dark-orange/brown patina, but it is pitted all over with patches of green intense corrosion product.","fourFigureLat":"50.940921","fourFigureLon":"-1.232801","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1200","notes":"Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age.
