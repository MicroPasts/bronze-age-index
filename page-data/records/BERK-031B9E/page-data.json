BC 800 – 600. The fragment consists of a quadrant part of the mouth, the attachment loop and a part of the body, excluding the blade section. The mouth has a double mouth moulding with the feintest trace of a vertical ridge, extending down the front of the casting. The loop is skewed at a slight angle to the vertical and the casting seam has not been removed. The axe, bearing a close resemblance to the Quay Fen Hoard (Cambridgeshire) Sompting type, Cardiff II variant (nos. 79+80) as seen in ‘The Early Iron Age socketed axes in Britain’ Volume 1 by I Dorothee Boughton. It is possible that this example was a non-functional variation with the walls thinning from 4.6mm to 2.54mm. The surface is eroded with a dark to mid green patina. Dimensions – length = 64.57mm, width = 27.8mm, thickness = 2.54mm, weight = 47.1gm.\n\n\n\nSee - http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/14716/1/Boughton%20Dot%20Final%20e-Thesis%20%28Master%20Copy%29.pdf","fourFigureLat":"51.47255659","fourFigureLon":"-1.42548856","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.54","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welford","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rodt/BERK031B9E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"64.57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
