It measures 59.8mm in bent length (originally c.90mm) and weighs 3.67g.\n\nThe pointed end is circular in section and 2.1mm in diameter. This widens to the centre part of the awl, which is 3mm in diameter. To the other end, the awl narrows to 1.4mm thick (still 3mm wide). On one side of the flattened end, distict edges are visible, rather like flanges. They have probably been flattened but may have had a purpose. They extends only 20mm.","fourFigureLat":"51.15017","fourFigureLon":"-2.144349","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"February 01, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"3","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Heytesbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Barnes0308awl.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"59.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
