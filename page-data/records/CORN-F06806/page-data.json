The palstave is missing its butt end which was hafted to the handle and likely broke at this point during use with the rest of the palstave still attached to the handle. The palstave has the remains of a rounded protruding stop ridge on both sides, 27 mm in total thickness, with recessed apertures within, 7 mm deep, which would have originally held the end of the haft or handle for the axehead. Below the stop ridge, which is 26 mm wide, the front and the back of the blade are recessed, 20 mm in thickness, and the sides are slightly inset and parallel to begin with, at 25 mm in width, but expand towards the cutting edge, 44 mm in width, to form a triangular-shaped blade in plan. The blade end is damaged and 9 mm in thickness, but there are no signs of it expanding to a crescentic edge. The surface of the blade is damaged and pitted but does not appear to have been decorated. The sides are also pitted and corroded but there is no evidence of the remains of the bottom of a side loop.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a slender palstave with no mouldings on the blade from the hoard of mainly shield-patterned palstaves found at St Tudy, Cornwall, on p.78, pl.5, no.78d.\n\n\n\nPalstaves with shield-shaped decoration and expanded blades can be found during the Acton Park II metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) of the Middle Bronze, such as the palstave illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, p.128, fig.29, no.96).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar palstaves with low flanges, rounded stops and plain, triangular blades from the south of Scotland and Churwell, West Yorkshire in plate 61, nos.839 & 844, which are un-classified, but grouped with the South-western palstaves, and related to continental examples, respectively, but the latter is due to its decoration and not the form which is similar to this example. These South-western type palstaves are compared to items produced during the Ornament Horizon of the later Middle Bronze Age such as a palstave in the Taunton hoard (c.1400-1275 BC) on pp.141-143.","fourFigureLat":"50.05161413","fourFigureLon":"-5.28412727","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1275","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"September 30, 2019","datefound2":"October 07, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gunwalloe","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8299.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"100"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
