The fragment is rectangular in plan and lenticular in section with an overall surviving length of 59.4mm. The fragment has straight transverse breaks on each end and there is a slight bend in the length , suggesting deliberate breakage prior to deposition (‘ritually killed’). The blade has a shallow raised central midrib c.13.5mm wide on both faces (overall object depth of 7.9mm) flanked on each side by a shallow concave section to the blade edge. The blade edge is slightly faceted on both sides (max object width 34.4mm). The fragment weighs 70.56g and has a medium to light green patina with traces of light green and azurite corrosion product.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.\n\n\n\nSimilar finds are recorded on the PAS database including a very similar sized fragment with the same transverse breaks (SUR-42B7D9). Other similar finds recorded on the PAS include NMGW-FE5523, WMID-871F5F, NMGW-49B5F1, NMGW-35639F\n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n\n\nNeedham, S. 1996. Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age.
