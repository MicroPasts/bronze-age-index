The flanges begin about a third of the way along the butt's length. The cleft between the flanges is relatively smother perhaps from use. There is a significant casting fault in one side of the butt, rectangular in shape. The casting seem is visible along the sides of the axehead, though some effort to reduce it appears to have taken place. The stop is pronounced and overhangs a little which accentuates the wasting effect of the blade's flare. The stop has right-angled corners with the flanges. The loop is on one side which arcs over the position on the stop. The blade is long, thin and narrow and extends extensively before flaring out at the blade end. There is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is has a heavily mottled patination. Within the flanges it has a dark grey-green patination, towards the butt end and along the flanges it has a much lighter green-white corrosion cause by wear and corrosion. The blade end is a medium mid green colour. There are some areas of historic damage across the blade indicated by their patination.\n\n\n\nTotal Measurements: 135.9mm long, 38.67mm at widest (28.03mm wide at stop-ridge without loop) 20.72mm thick and 450g in weight","fourFigureLat":"51.16154184","fourFigureLon":"1.15936753","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.72","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Denton with Wootton","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lrogerson/KENT39B4402.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"135.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
