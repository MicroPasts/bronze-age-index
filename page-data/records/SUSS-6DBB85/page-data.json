The surviving fragment has a hollow centre, representing the beginning of a socket. The front and rear surfaces of the axe are slightly concave with multiple sub-oval indentations and there are raised casting seams remaining along each side.  The blade edge is worn, and the tips irregular through use.  while the breaks on the body are also old and worn. The exterior surfaces of the axehead have a mid-green patina. \n\n\n\nNot enough of the artefact is extant in order to determine further typological designation, but socketed axes generally date from the Middle to Late Bronze Age through to the Early Iron Age (circa BC 1300-BC 800). It is possibly of Southern Eastern type, which date c. 900-600 BC. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: length: 53.61mm; width at blade: 55.65mm; thickness at break: 16.75mm and weight. 130g","fourFigureLat":"50.81838786","fourFigureLon":"0.00026856","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.75","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rodmell","county":"East Sussex","district":"Lewes","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS6DBB85.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"53.61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
