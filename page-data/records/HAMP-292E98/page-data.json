This flanged example is characteristic of the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage.  The blade terminates in a wide, crescentic curved cutting edge.  One of the terminals of this curves to a sharp point while the other is abraded.  Bevelling to create the edge is shallow, beginning just below the line of the terminals.  The flanged sides give the artefact a pointed oval cross section.  They feature flange facets in profile.  They are up to 16.5mm thick, and rise up above the septum by c. 3.5mm at the crests.  The curved butt is slightly abraded (W.: 21.6mm).  Where it survives the patina is a dark green colour.  Otherwise the axe has suffered corrosion, in lighter hues, and more active damage which is a brighter green.","fourFigureLat":"51.058661","fourFigureLon":"-1.373548","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"October 06, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hursley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-292E98flataxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"107.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
