It is double ended, with one end being circular in section while tapering to a sharp rounded point. The opposing end is broadly rectangular in section while thinning to a chisel-like point, though the tip of the latter is broken away in old damage. The centre of the object is broadly square in section. \n\n\n\nThe object measures 62.8 mm in length. It measures 4.9 mm wide in the centre, is 2.4 mm wide at the rounded point terminal and is 4.25 mm wide at the chisel like terminal. It has a thickness in the centre of 4.7 mm, measures 2.0 mm thick at the rounded terminal and is 1.7 mm thick at the chisel like terminal. It weighs 5.8 g. \n\n\n\nThe object is a dark brown in colour with an even patina. There are areas of light green colouring which may be copper corrosion products. Abrasion caused by movment whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.
