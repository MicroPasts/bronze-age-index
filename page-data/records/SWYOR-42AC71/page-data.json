In plan, from the square (incomplete?) butt  end the width gently expands to the blade end and then curves out at a  greater angle to the corners of the blade. The blade edge and tips are  damaged. In section, the axe is sub rectangular and there are no ridge /  stop or flanges. It tapers in thickness towards the blade and the butt. The sides are slightly rounded. It is  corroded over most of the surface and this has caused pitting. The blade  edge is uneven with bits missing and worn away. Small areas of the original surface and patina survive on the blade on both faces. There are diagonal scratched lines or striations one the surviving patina on one face, and transverse striations on the other face. The striations are usually the result of grinding the blade to sharpen it. Where it survives, the patina is a smooth glossy olive green. Compare DUR-8DF7F1 and DENO-8FC3A2.","fourFigureLat":"53.602967","fourFigureLon":"-1.381888","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"July 31, 2010","datefound2":"November 11, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.58","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hemsworth","county":"Wakefield","district":"Wakefield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1359_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"102.02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
