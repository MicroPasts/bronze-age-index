The tang is over half of the awl. The other half is square in section, tapering to a blunt, rounded point. The surface has traces of a mottled light grey-green patina.\n\n\n\nIt measures 51.61mm long, 5.98mm wide, 5.52mm thick and weighs 6.2g.\n\n\n\nAwls can date from the Bronze Age, c. 1250 BC but as the design of awls has changed very little, it could also be much more recent. The patina perhaps suggests a Roman date, but this is not certain.","fourFigureLat":"51.56216935","fourFigureLon":"-1.36665665","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"July 31, 2017","datefound2":"August 30, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.52","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Hendred","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW93F78D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"51.61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
