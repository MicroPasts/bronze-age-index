In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The axehead is broken, with the butt end missing. The break is an irregular concave in shape; the width at the break is 37.99&nbsp;mm&nbsp;(thickness:7.23 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the break to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (11.33&nbsp;mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 45.59 mm&nbsp;(thickness 7.98mm).\n\nIt measures 62.07mm&nbsp;in length, &nbsp;and it has a maximum thickness of 11.32&nbsp;mm. It weighs 145.65 grams.\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. One side has a patch of light green corrosion where the surface patina is damaged, possibly from abrasion caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the original surface detail.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.&nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.
