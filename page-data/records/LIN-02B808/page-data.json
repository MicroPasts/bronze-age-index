Only the butt remains. The fragment is triangular in profile and has a curved butt. The edges extend to form a narrow ledge at the top and bottom. The break exposes two circular indentations that appear to have been caused by air bubbles formed during the casting process. The presence of these indentations may have caused this area of the axe to have been particularly weak, thus causing the break. The break is roughly straight, but irregular enough to suggest it is not an intentional cut.","fourFigureLat":"53.298714","fourFigureLon":"-0.516003","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"February 01, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welton","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN2013-1048.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"24"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
