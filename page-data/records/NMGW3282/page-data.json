The mouth of the socket, the edges and end of the blade and much of the original surface of the spearhead are missing. The side loops on the socket are also missing; however, their original position, approximately midway along the incomplete socket, is indicated by the surviving stubs of the loops (set c.8-9mm apart). The socket continues for a short way into the blade. There is no evidence to suggest that the spearhead was originally decorated. Surviving length 76mm, surviving length of blade 41mm, maximum surviving external diameter of socket 13.5mm, maximum surviving width of blade 13mm, maximum thickness of midrib 8mm. This is an example of Ehrenberg's Class IV spearhead (cf. Ehrenberg 1977, 7-9) and Davis' Class 6 Unclassified (Davis 2012, 106, No.648, Pl.37).","fourFigureLat":"51.45763714","fourFigureLon":"-3.31116217","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1275","notes":"A small example of a Class IV side-looped/Class 6 Unclassified Developed Side-looped Bronze Age spearhead. It is interesting to note that the spearhead blade lodged in the vertebra of one of the two inhumed individuals excavated at Tormarton, Gloucestershire was also a small example of a side-looped spearhead. In her study of the spearheads from Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, Ehrenberg noted that examples of the type from her study area ranged in length from 90mm to 210mm (1997,7); when complete the St Nicholas spearhead's length probably fell within the lower part of that range. Side-looped spearheads are a Middle Bronze Age type whose main vogue can be dated to the Acton Park and Taunton metalwork phases (c.1500 BC to c.1250 BC) although later examples are known (Davis 2012, 108-110; Needham et al. 1997, 84-86).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip MacDonald","datefound1":"February 01, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Nicholas and Bonvilston","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"76"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
