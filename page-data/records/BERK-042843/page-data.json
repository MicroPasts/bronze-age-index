The socketed end of the gouge has a circular section and an internal diameter of 16 mm. The end of the socket, which may have been collared or just lipped, is now missing due to an old break. The gouge tapers down its length into a C-shaped section, with a furrow widening down the length from the open socket. The furrow widens from a point to c. 9mm. A gouge of this type would have been used for woodworking. Similar examples are recorded on this database including one from Dorset (DOR-FD5EF4), another from near Salisbury (WILT-1D68BC) as well as part of a hoard from Cumbria (LANCUM-6F9525).","fourFigureLat":"51.43780084","fourFigureLon":"-1.785591","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"19.3","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Preshute","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2015390.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"80.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
