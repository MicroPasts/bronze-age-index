The artefact is heavily rolled resulting in abrasion to all surfaces. What remains is globular in form (teardrop shaped) with an oval cross section. It is probably one of a pair of pointed drop-shaped elements conjoined by an integrally cast bar. The remains of a heavily eroded rectangular bar is present on one side of the droplet. The external edges are all decorated with multiple longitudinal grooves The metal is a mid-green in colour with a smooth patina.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThese moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45, BERK-C3E5A3 and BH-AA1CBE. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.\n\n\n\nThe object measures: 8.36mm thick, 17.36mm in length, 10.76mm in width and weighs 4.6 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.2171443","fourFigureLon":"-2.85037379","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"80","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jake Benjamin Dolphin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jake Benjamin Dolphin","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.36","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eardisland","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dolphin/HESH40BA7C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"17.36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
