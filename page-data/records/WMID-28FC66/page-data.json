Even though the artefact is badly corroded and broken at tip and socket, the fairly prominent midrib with blade wings are still visible.  The artefact has a circular socketed shaft which is open into the hollow cavity of the head.  As well as general amounts of corrosion, there is a significant amount of bronze disease present in the bottom of the hollow shaft.  There is also a small hole along the line of the midrib halfway down the blade.  The possible arrowhead has a dark green/ brown patina.\n\nBronze arrowheads dating to this period are extremely rare in Britain, with one found as part of a hoard in Penard, Wales (Savory, 1980, oage 57) as well as possible arrowheads found on the Isle of Portland, Sussex, Yorkshire, Montgomeryshire and another on display in Norwich Museum.  Bronze arrowheads seem to appear more regularly in France where they were first manufactured in the Middle Bronze Age, in the Paris basin and the west-central area (Savory, page 57).","fourFigureLat":"52.669667","fourFigureLon":"-1.897922","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"August 30, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hammerwich","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-28FC66.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"51.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
