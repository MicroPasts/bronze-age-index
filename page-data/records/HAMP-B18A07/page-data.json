This small example is from the earliest bronze working traditions, dating from the centuries after c. 2000 BC. The blade terminates in a rounded cutting edge. Bevelling to create the edge is gradual. Beyond the edge the object narrows to a width of 16.65mm and is at its thickest, 7.6mm.  The object remains a fairly constant width to the butt.  It narrows very gradually, and then more obviously in the quarter at the butt end. The axehead has a rectangular cross-section with no side flanges as such; the surfaces are very slightly concave, though. The artefact has corroded to dark-brown colour, pitted all over. One of the corners of the butt end is notably abraded.","fourFigureLat":"51.263112","fourFigureLon":"-1.026799","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"February 19, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Old Basing and Lychpit","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-B18A07flataxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"52.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
