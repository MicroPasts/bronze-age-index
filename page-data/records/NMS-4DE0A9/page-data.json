Octagonal-sectioned socketed handle with two rivet holes positioned on the long axis on each face, now filled with corossion product. Within the socket is a fragment of wood, traces of a white substance, possibly adhesive (or wax) and a ring of corrosion product running around the mouth. The handle tapers slightly from a width of 25.5mm to 21.5mm before expanding into the shoulders to a maximum width of 42.1mm. The junction between the integrally cast blade and the hilt is stepped on both faces, with a central U-shaped cut out in the centre of the hilt. The blade tapers in width along its length from 41.2mm to 25mm, terminating in a transverse break. It has a lenticular cross-section with a pronounced median rib on both faces. The long edges are heavily abraded. The sword exhibits a smooth dark brown patina, with green patination along the edges, around the area of the break and areas which appear to have been abraded due to movement in the plough soil.\n\n\n\nSee: Colquhoun & Burgess 1988, The Swords of Britain, pl. 90, nos. 603 & 607.","fourFigureLat":"52.46519225","fourFigureLon":"1.17832897","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"August 11, 2018","datefound2":"August 11, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Moulton","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jshoemark5/62979_4DE0A9_BA_Sword.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"111"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
