The palstave has a well developed stop with high flanges along the sides. The septum has three moulded parallel ridges within it. The blade is wedge-shaped, with straight sides and flares to approximately 70mm in width with a slightly curved cutting edge. Each face of the blade has a vertical rib running down the middle, forming a trident where it intersects with a semi-eliptical ornament below the stop.","fourFigureLat":"50.8195609","fourFigureLon":"-0.72372648","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1200","notes":"This example is very similar to one from Harston, Cambridgeshire published in Evans (1881), p78, Fig 60.
