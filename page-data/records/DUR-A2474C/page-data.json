It has a maximum width of 60.87 mm. The object is broken and so the butt is not present whcih makes the maximum length of the object 84.13 mm. The flanges are prominent and measure 18.33 mm in thickness. The septum thickness is 11.79 mm, and has a maximum width of 22.47 mm including the flanges. There is no stop ridge. The blade facet is clear, and the cutting edge is well preserved and still sharp. There are areas of corrosion across the object, particularly towards the irregular breakage at the top. A similar examples is LANCUM-19A734, or DOR-5D7F46, but with the flanges projecting closer towards the blade.\n\n\n\nThe axe is of the flanged type which dates to the Arreton (1700 -1500 BC) series. They have characteristically wide blades, and precede the narrower looped Palstaves of later periods.","fourFigureLat":"55.03352214","fourFigureLon":"-2.00153443","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Elliott McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Elliott McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittington","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/a8622912/DUR-A2474C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"84.13"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
