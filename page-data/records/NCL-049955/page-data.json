The entire head has been cast integral, with a conical socket retaining sideloops near the base of the socket. The lower edge of the socket has suffered from damage, which is now abraded. Worn flashmarks are also visible running up the socket from the socket base to the base of the blade, longitudinally in line with the sideloops.\n\n\n\nThe blade is 'leaf-shaped', with rounded shoulders, uneven edges, and an extremely worn and rounded tip. The socket continues down the length of the blade for its entire length as a very prominent rib. The blade appears to have been considerably worn through use (and resharpening?) during its life prior to deposition.\n\n\n\nThe surface has an even green patina.","fourFigureLat":"53.18397504","fourFigureLon":"-0.04105561","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"August 06, 2013","datefound2":"September 03, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"13.94","edge":null,"thickness":"1.51","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hameringham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/NCL-049955.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"95.44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
