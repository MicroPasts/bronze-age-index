The loop is formed from wrought gold wire (th: 2.57mm) which has been bent into a drop shape. Where the ends cross, the loop has been cut, with evidence for four strikes. One cut put a wedge in the object but did not completely sever it. A second cut severed one end of the loop. The two remaining cuts are both part of the severing of the other end of the loop. The gold is probably a gold-silver alloy. There are no direct comparisons, but similar cutmarks have been observed on Bronze Age gold objects, for example no 25.1 in Treasure Annual Report 2004. Therefore, the object cannot be dated with any certainty, but it is most probably Bronze Age in date.","fourFigureLat":"54.133056","fourFigureLon":"-1.343418","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"March 08, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"2.66","edge":null,"thickness":"2.57","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brafferton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/DSCN9389.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Museum of Antiquities of the University and Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne","length":"16.21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
