The axe is possibly of Type Bandon, Variant Swinton but it is smaller that so far known examples. The object resembles a miniature version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads. The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow sub-rounded butt and parallel slightly tapering sides which expand to the cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly convex (bowed). In profile and cross section the axehead is lentoid. The patina has broken away leaving a red-brown corroded and pitted surface.\n\n\n\nMiniature flat axes such as this tends to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC.\n\n\n\nThe length is 80mm, the width is 20mm and the thickness 17mm.\n\n\n\nThe axe is of a diminutive size, if it is a Type Bandon, Variant Swinton and it remains unclear whether the axe had a practical purpose or was votive. It is possible that the 'axe' may have been used for delicate tasks, perhaps similar to a chisel. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K., 1981 The Axes of Scotland and Northern England Munich : Prahistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung , 67-68 ,","fourFigureLat":"53.85557061","fourFigureLon":"-2.39675242","fromdate":"-2050","todate":"-1750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"May 13, 2016","datefound2":"May 13, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pendleton","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMB28EB0.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"80"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
