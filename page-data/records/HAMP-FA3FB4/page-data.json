Both artefacts have a square cross-section that tapers to a point at both ends. On the longer the squareness is more obvious, perhaps as it has suffered from less corrosion; at one end, at which the object curves, the tapering is less pointed. On the shorter the body is thicker and the object narrows to what is argubaly a 'tang'. Such construction is typical of prehistoric awls which are thought to date from the late Bronze Age. The darker (and longer) has the following dimensions: L.: 74.35mm, max. Th.: 5.3mm, Wt.: 9.71g. The lighter (shorter) has the following dimensions: L.: 63.95mm, max.
