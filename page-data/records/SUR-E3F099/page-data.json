The remaining portion is 52.7mm in length and probably comprises around 60% of the whole tool. The axehead is cast in a two part mould and is broken across the upper part of the blade. The section is sub rectangular with a proto stop ridge / median bevel at the wide part and tapers after the mid-point object to a thin rounded butt end. The external edges have a slight hammer raised flange and are slightly bevelled. The front part of the axehead has broken away, but the sides suggest that it would have flared outwards in width at this point.","fourFigureLat":"51.16813536","fourFigureLon":"-2.15870792","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-1600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"October 22, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sutton Veny","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURE3F099.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"52.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
