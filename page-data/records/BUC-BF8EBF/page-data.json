The fragment has lost all its diagnostic features and so the classification cannot be further refined. The fragment consists of the body of the blade with a rounded circular midrib ridge which narrows either side to form the blade. The ridge measures 9.8mm in width and 10.2mm in thickness. The edges of the blade are worn and broken, and it is unclear what the shape the original blade would have been. The piece is lozenge in cross section and has a shiny mid green patina. The fragment is 24.7mm in width, 20.7mm in length, and is 5.5mm thick. The fragment weighs 12.11g.","fourFigureLat":"51.22058407","fourFigureLon":"-1.38567241","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"May 28, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hurstbourne Priors","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUCBF8EBF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"20.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
