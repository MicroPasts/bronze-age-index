At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket of sub-rectangular form (22.01mm x 7mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 4mm), probably broken in antiquity.&nbsp; The cutting edge is gently curving with rounded corners. The surfaces are badly corroded with no evidence of a casting seam or any decoration. It has a mid-green patina.\n\nDimensions:&nbsp;length 34.94mm, width 35.80mm, thick 12.26mm, weight 56.22g\n\nDiscussion: The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c.1100 &ndash; 800BC. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.","fourFigureLat":"51.17128886","fourFigureLon":"1.13141792","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Steven Nye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"12.25","edge":null,"thickness":"12.26","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barham","county":"Kent","district":"Canterbury","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lrogerson/KENT483F66.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"34.94"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
