The fragment is broadly lanceolate (or leaf-shaped) in plan and has a lozenge-section midrib which tapers towards the tip, now missing. The outer edgesof the flanking wing bladeshave suffered damage. The upper portion of the circular-sectioned hollow socket is intact, where it meets with the spear tip and the sub-conical aperture created by the socket runs almost all of the way upwards into the remaining tip fragment, measuring 39.1 mm in length. The broken edge of the tip itself is solid cast, indicating that the missing portion would have also been solid cast. The spearhead measures 48.06 mm long, 19.82 mm wide (at wing blades), 11.09 mm thick, with a 9.38 mm external socket diameter and an approximate 7 mm internal socket diameter; it weighs 16.06 grams.","fourFigureLat":"50.85529636","fourFigureLon":"-0.05498599","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1001","notes":"\nThis object has been assessed with the assistant of FLO Peter Reavill, who specialises in Bronze Age objects.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"March 16, 2014","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stephanie Smith","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"9.38","edge":null,"thickness":"11.09","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Ann (Without)","county":"East Sussex","district":"Lewes","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS0F21A9.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"48.06"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
