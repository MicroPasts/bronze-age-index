The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap. There is noticeable wear to the outer edge of the object as the surface is smoother and the punched dots are much shallower.\n\n\n\nLength: 82.09mm\n\n\n\nWidth: 68.57mm\n\n\n\nDiameter: 11.55mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 311g\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nThe armring is similar in form to those of the Tullydonnell hoard from County Donegal, which were dated to c. 1200 - 800 BC. A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors:                                                                                                         \n\n\n\nLydia Prosser\n\nFLO for Lancashire and Cumbria\n\n\n\nNeil Wilkin\n\nThe British Museum\n\n\n\nMary Cahill​​​​​​​\n\nNational Museum of Ireland Galway","fourFigureLat":"54.5103938","fourFigureLon":"-3.62327836","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"In terms of the date and precious metal content of this object, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Miss.
