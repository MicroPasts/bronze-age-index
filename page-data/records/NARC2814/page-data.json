The tip is broken of and missing a small fragment, therefore it is not possible to be certain of its original shape. The blade has a slightly raised flattened midrib section on both faces,  with broad edge bevels. The junction between the socket and the blade is straight with a simple 'step' from socket to blade.  The socket is quite 'waisted' in plan, and a waisted oval in cross-section, the junction of the socket and blade is wider than the mouth, which has no obvious mouth-moulding, the edge of the mouth is slightly corroded and there is a small section missing.  There is a circular aperture, presumably the peg hole, on both faces of the socket. The mouth is oval, and the socket sub-triangular in section.  There is some wood remaining in the socket.","fourFigureLat":"50.661382","fourFigureLon":"-1.124177","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Part of a hoard of eleven implements.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Rhiannon Harte","datefound1":"February 01, 2002","datefound2":"March 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.81","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Sandown","county":"Isle of Wight","district":"Isle of Wight","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sworrell/IOW2002-26 Kirkton Hoard.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Finder","length":"134.66"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
