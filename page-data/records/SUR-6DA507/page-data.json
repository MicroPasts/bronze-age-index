The combination of a pointed tip and a spatulate terminal on this object suggests that it could alternatively be a stylus of Roman date.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"October 04, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Finder applying for an export licence","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bicester","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Cherwell","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR6DA507.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"52.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
