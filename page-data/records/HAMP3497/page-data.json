Cylindrical, with straight sides which expand out. Circular perforation (not complete) in one side. The outer surface has faintly incised decoration consisting of three zones which have an irregular horizontal line with closely-spaced triangles which are infilled with faint diagonal lines, followed by a further horizontal line below. Smooth, dark green patina. The decoration is reminiscent of Ornament-horizon pieces, such as decorated arm-rings with geometric design. The tapering diameter may suggest a socketed spearhead.
