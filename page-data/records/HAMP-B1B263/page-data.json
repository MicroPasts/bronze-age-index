Both 'faces' of the object are slightly flattened, as is the interior edge; the outside edge is convex. The terminals are cut in parallel alignment with each other and measure 4.1x5.0mm and 4.3x5.0mm. The object is slightly thicker at the edge opposite the terminals, where it measure 5.1mm in max.thickness. It measures 15.3mm between this edge and the terminals, and 15.7mm perpendicular to this. The internal area is oval in shape and measures 6.8x7.1mm. The object weighs 4.68g.","fourFigureLat":"50.90274203","fourFigureLon":"-0.94900041","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"'The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008).
