The terminology used below follows that of Davis. Although complete there is some damage to the blade both ancient and modern, probably the result of agricultural activity. Surface colour is predominantly dark brown some of the damaged areas have green corrosion. The tip of a wooden shaft survives within the socket. Length: 125 mm, Width: 26 mm, D; 72 mm, Weight: 67.1 g. The blade is flame-shaped with a low (25%) 'Position of Maximum Width' and slightly concave blade edges. The blade surface is flat with a distinct bevel to the blade edges. It has a long midrib with a circular cross-section. The socket base aperture is 19 mm at the widest point. Loop plates have been modified after casting and are lozenge-shaped. Grooves left by sharpening are visible on the bevels and edges of the blade. There are clear indications of working around the loops in the form of striations made by an abrasive tool such as a file.\n\n\n\nType 6A have a number of distribution concentrations the main ones being the Thames Valley and East Anglian fenland. There is a secondary distribution in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Northumberland and eastern Scotland. Spearheads of this type have been found in Lincolnshire at Digby (Daubney 2010), Temple Bruer (Vine, 1987) and Tetford (Davey, 1973). The Digby example most closely resembles this spearhead from Woolsthorpe by Belvoir. There is a similar example on display in Yorkshire Museum. The provenance is 'Yorks\" and it is slightly larger and heavier than the Woolsthorpe spearhead (Davis, 2012, 16 no. 224; Radley, 1967).\n\n\n\nGroup 6 spearheads are most likely to date to the Taunton metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1250 cal BC) although the earliest examples may date to the late stages of the preceding Acton Park phase. Dating is based primarily on hoard associations.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nDaubney, A. (2010).
