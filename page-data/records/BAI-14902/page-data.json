A small piece of shaft remains also part of a rivet. Of a type rare outside the British Isles. Although made on a bronze model appears to be of iron and thus belongs to a period when iron was first introduced and its technique not yet properly mastered. Edge is rather chipped and the collar at socket mouth is a separate piece of metal from the rest.","fourFigureLat":"51.719666","fourFigureLon":"-3.568595","fromdate":null,"todate":null,"notes":null,"materialTerm":null,"identifier":null,"datefound1":null,"datefound2":null,"subsequentActionTerm":null,"recorder":null,"gridSource":null,"quantity":"NA","height":null,"diameter":null,"edge":"43","thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"","parish":"Rhigos","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taff","district":"","regionName":null,"country":"Wales","patina":"Dark greenish and greyish green patina.","surface":"Smooth.
