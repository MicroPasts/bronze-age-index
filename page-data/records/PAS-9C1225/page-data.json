The fragment is pointed oval in cross-section with smooth curve on both surfaces and no discernible mid rib. There are old patinated breaks at each end and down each side, obscuring the original shape. However, in one corner the fragment does appear to flare out slightly, though this may be illusory; the width is generally consistent.\n\n\n\nIt is 28.05mm long, 20.7mm wide,3.7mm thick. It weighs 10.37grams. The surfaces are slightly corroded.","fourFigureLat":"51.58929397","fourFigureLon":"-1.39514884","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"March 31, 2014","datefound2":"March 31, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Finder applying for an export licence","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lockinge","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley2/PAS9C1225.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28.05"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
