Recognising that further pieces remained in situ beneath the ploughsoil, the finder covered the site up and contacted PAS. A small excavation was undertaken to recover contextual information. The remainder of the assemblage was found to be lying within a former submerged land surface. The landowner was unable to confirm that the area had been drained and reclaimed in the 19th Century. It seems likely that this hoard and Tal Y Garn 1 hoard were placed in or on the edge of a bog.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sian Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"23","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
