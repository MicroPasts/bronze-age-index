The fragment is roughly leaf-shaped with a pointed oval (or flat diamond-shaped) cross-section. The outside edges are very wavy and ragged and there does not appear to be a socket, instead being tanged, though this has broken off. The sides appear to curve inwards towards the tang. There is no decoration on the surface. A smooth mid green patina survives in places but mud adhereing to the faces obscures much of the surface. The break is not as patiated as the rest of the object. The probable razor is 53.52mm long, 19.26mm wide and 4.4mm thick. It is 2.4mm thick at tip. 12.77g. Compare SF5067 and SWYOR-A48EE1 which is from the neighbouring parish.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments that Double edged razors have a distribution which was \"Widespread across Britain and Ireland, particularly in the Midlands, Yorkshire, Wessex and the Thames area.\" He goes on to cite The PAS Bronze Age Guide by Ben Roberts, that: \"The term double-edged razor covers three broad types of the same implement; those that were handled, [those] with a pierced tang, and [those] with a non-pierced tang. Representing the earliest form of copper-alloy razor, these varied in shape, starting initially with the handled examples which resembled spearheads (i.e. elongated triangular-edges, with one or two rivet holes at the base for affixing a handle. The tanged varieties were more leaf shaped, echoing the styles that came afterwards. The overall shape and size of these razors varied slightly across different regions of continental Europe, resulting in many different typologies and sub-categories.\"","fourFigureLat":"53.45778377","fourFigureLon":"-1.15808943","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"May 31, 2014","datefound2":"September 10, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wadworth","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2364_spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"53.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
