The knife measures 141.15mm in length, 21.87mm in maximum width and 3.9mm in maximum depth. It weighs 49.87g. It has a rounded tip and widens only slightly along the length of the blade. It then narrows to the damaged tang, which is 16.18mm wide at this point and narrows to 14.22mm. The length of the tang is about 22.5mm. The object's mid olive green patina is patchy and much of the surface has flaked off. Similar knives have been found at Maesbury Camp, near Wells in Somerset and at Bilbury Rings in Wiltshire. The Maesbury Camp example is slightly wider and longer (Pearce 1983, volume ii, pp. 511 and 634, plate 73, no. 644) and the Bilbury Rings example is shorter at 115mm (Moore and Rowlands 1972, p. 66, plate XVI, no. 89).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Naomi Payne","datefound1":"December 20, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Naomi Payne","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Dorset","district":"","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/npayne/A082F6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"141.15"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
