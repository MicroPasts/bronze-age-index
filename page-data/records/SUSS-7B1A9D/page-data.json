One surface is almost flat and the other slightly convex possibly with the remains of a midrib. The tang is also lenticular  in cross section with opposing convex surfaces. The surface extending from the flat side of the blade steeply convex and the opposing side extending from the midrib side is gently convex and almost flat. The tang measures12.44mm at the base of the blade tapering to a point. It thickens from 7.68mm tapering to 1.75mm at the tip. The side profile of the tang terminates in a curve with a sharply upturned tip.The object is covered in pale green corrosion, but is a bright copper underneath. \n\n\n\nMeasurements: length: 91.86mm; width: 32.78mm; thickness of blade: 7.31mm and weight: 51.75g. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: The upturned tang would have held the original wood, bone or antler handle in place.
