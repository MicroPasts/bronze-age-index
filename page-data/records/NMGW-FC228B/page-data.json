The butt end has some damage (with a width of 21mm and a thickness of 4.4mm). The sides are slightly divergent to the break (with a maximum width of 24.6mm and a thickness of 6.7mm - 7.3mm). There is the suggestion of a casting seam on one side, although little of the original surface survives. The flanges are beginning to develop above the septum but are shallow and corroded at the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 9.2mm with a height above the septum of 1.3mm). A small number of casting flaws are evident on the fragment. The surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright green surface loss and corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1] from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
