Rowlands 'Class 3 Group 2'.\n\n\n\nDescription:  The axhead has a solidly rectilinear butt which proceeds to flare outwards to the cutting edge. There is a distinct central mid-rib on the blade. Extended raised lines on both sides of the flaring flanges adjacent to the stop appear to be casting marks, which were not removed before deposition. The butt also has a swell on one side perhaps a casting fault which was not cleaned or prepared before use/deposition. The blade itself is triangular and incomplete. The axehead is heavily patinated and pitted due to corrossion. It has a mid - dark green colouraiton with some dark brown patches and speckles.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This palstave appears to be an example of the South Western type, which is commonly found across the South West of England in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset. Multiple single examples have been recorded by the PAS, including DEV-01DDC5 (Shipley 2018), DEV-054D5E (Shipley 2020) and SOM-F224AB (Caswell 2019). Pearce (1983: 432-3) illustrates a number of comparable examples in her study of metalwork from the region. \n\n\n\nThey are also comparable to those palstaves placed within Rowlands 'Class 3 Group 2' (see Rowlands 1976: pl 2 85 no.3, and p. 247). Rowlands Class 3 is characterised by a U-shaped septum profile, low triangular or slightly convex flanges, a straight sided triangular or crinoline blade and a triangular depression or ribbed motif beneath the stop-ridge (Rowlands 1976: 32-33). Group 1 and 2 within Class 3 are divided based on blade width, being 7-8cm and 5-6cm respectively. This group, having blades less than 6cm in width therefore fit in Group 2. This class is associated with Needham (1996)â€™s Period 5.","fourFigureLat":"51.28367611","fourFigureLon":"1.29683732","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mr David Clarke","datefound1":"September 17, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mr David Clarke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ash","county":"Kent","district":"Dover","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stuff8472/misc3831.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"169"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
