The pin has an open ring as its head, cast in one piece and slightly flatter in section than the shank at the juntion of both. There is no decoration on the pin head. The shank has a circular cross section and gently tapers to a sharp point; there is a slight bend towards the bottom of the shank.\n\n\n\nSmall undecorated pins, including quoit headed pins, are generally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age, c.1500-1200 BC. However, the date for these smaller examples, which may be either decorated or undecorated, may be slightly earlier. About 50 examples are recorded and mostly restricted to southern England and East Anglia.","fourFigureLat":"51.66136563","fourFigureLon":"-1.42310504","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.3","edge":null,"thickness":"2.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2016878.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"77.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
