The axehead is of a late Bronze Age type probably attributable to the Ewart Park Metalworking Industry, (c. 1000-700BC) with a single sideloop near the socket and three moulded ridges to each side of the blade which run half way down to the cutting edge. There is corrosion damage to the socket end on one side which has resulted in three fragments breaking away; they are however retained (2nd image). The socket is 37.3mm by 44mm and of sub rectangular form with a circumferential ridge around the opening. The blade edge is damaged from corrosion but flares slightly and tapers to a thickness of around 7mm. There are casting spurs along the seams on the sides.\n\n\n\nThe wood in the socket is soft and fibrous and a light tan / brown in colour. It appears to completely fill the hollow centre of the axehead (3rd image).","fourFigureLat":"51.0242423","fourFigureLon":"-2.17247349","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"\nThe retention of wood within the socket of this axehead is exceptionally rare and made possibly only by localised anaerobic preservation in a waterlogged context (possibly a ditch fill). These conditions have further resulted in poor preservation of the metal.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"37.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sedgehill and Semley","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURDADF32.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"92.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
