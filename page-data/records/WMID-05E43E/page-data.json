The fragment is sub rectangular in plan with curved ends to the blade, and triangular in section. The blade edge is worn and rough, and both sides are heavily corroded, with only a portion of the original surface intact on one side.  The remnants of the socket are rectangular in shape to a depth of 8.53 mm, 27.80 mm long and 5.57 mm in width.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead fragment measures 20.83 mm in length, 41.92 mm wide (at the blade), 27.80 mm wide (at the body), 10.60 mm thick (at the body), 2.21 mm thick (at the blade edge). It weighs 26.1 g.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead is a dark green to grey colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface. There is insufficient remnant to give a full identification.\n\n\n\nSimilar WMID-D9A2D5","fourFigureLat":"52.61573756","fourFigureLon":"-2.09005142","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Jones","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Jones","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Essington","county":"Staffordshire","district":"South Staffordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janevolunteer/WMID05E43Ejpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"20.83"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
