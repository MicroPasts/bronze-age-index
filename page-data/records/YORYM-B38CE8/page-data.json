The whole is heavily disfigured by buckling and denting, including a sharp bend at the break Both ends are neatly squared suggesting that the complete object is present. One of the terminals is emphasised by a slight external beading. Prior to damage, the back would have been flat, while the front carries twenty-four very finely incised grooves aligned longitudinally.\n\n\n\n\n\nExtant lengths 60.5 & 41.5 mm Length stretched out  c.117 mm width c. 17.5 mm thickness c. 0.5 mm weights  6.1 & 3.6 g","fourFigureLat":"54.19642212","fourFigureLon":"-0.42271002","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Identification\n\n\n\nThis object cannot be identified with total certainty, but similar multi-grooved ribbon ornaments of Bronze Age date and varied in size are known from north-west Europe; this provides the most likely cultural background. The length of the ribbon, if complete, is too short for other than a child’s bracelet. Another ornamental function is more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrow-ribbon ornaments from the Saint-Marc-le-Blanc hoard, Brittany, have fewer and correspondingly broader ribs/grooves. They are finer on an earring from Saint-Père-en-Retz (Loire-Atlantique) and finer still on some Irish Bronze Age ornaments. Among the latter are examples in two important associations, from Saintjohns, Co Kildare, and Derrinboy, Co Offaly. The Derrinboy pieces have enhanced ribs along the long edges not present on the Flixton object, but they are of similar length. Good parallels are harder to find in Britain, but there is a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, excavated from a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age. Three gold grooved strips from Scottish grave finds which served as pommel mounts for Early Bronze Age daggers are crafted differently and may be less relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThis object is predominantly of precious metal, is almost certainly over 300 years old and potentially of archaeological interest both locally and for broader stylistic studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr S.P.
