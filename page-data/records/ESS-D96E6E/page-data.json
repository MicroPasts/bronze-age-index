Migdale type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44). The axehead is rectangular in shape with the butt being narrow, gradually widening to a flared cutting edge. All edges show signs of damage, though the butt end appears to have broken away. The blade end is also incredibly damaged. There is a light green patina with patches of dark brown corrosion in places.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is similar to the Migdale axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44), although many of these have a wider flared cutting edge. A similar object can be seen in Schmidt & Burgess (1981, fig 190, plate 16).\n\n\n\nThe length of the axe is 73.69mm. The width of the butt is 20.45mm (4.68mm thickness) and the cutting edge is 38.68mm. The axehead weighs 142.71 grams. \n\n\n\nReference: Schmidt, P. and Burgess, C. 1981.
