These items are said to date from the mid-late Bronze Age up to the Iron Age.  The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval and is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item which come to a halt about half way along the full length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated.  The patina is primarily deep brown but patches of invasive corrosion have caused a loss of this outer surface.  The interior of the object has a light green corrosive covering.\n\nDue to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete but based on other known examples (e.g. SF9183) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original.  The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle with a hole through the centre of this bridge.  This form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings.  The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion.\n\nThis item measures 29.62mm in length, has a maximum width (side to side of the 'bowl' opening) of 12.82mm and a width (from front to back of the 'bowl' shaped section)of 11.89mm.  The item weighs 8.16g.","fourFigureLat":"51.776875","fourFigureLon":"-1.189724","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Charlotte Burrill","datefound1":"March 31, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Charlotte Burrill","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stanton St. John","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cburrill/Iron Age Moustache Mount or Fitting.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Berkshire","length":"29.62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
