BC 1050 - c. BC 950.\n\n\n\nThe blade of the palstave is sub-oval or tongue shaped in plan. The cutting edge measures 34 mm in width and is 6.7 mm thick. The blade is blunt and has been heavily damaged, no cutting edge is visible. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The object measures 27.4 mm in width and 28.4 mm thick at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge the axe has been decorated with two diagonal raised ridges or ribs, forming a triangle, with a vertical ridge in between, on one face of the object. The opposite face, shows evidence of similar decoration below the stop ridge and evidence of a raised mid rib in the centre of the axe.\n\n\n\nThe rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is broadly rectangular in plan and broadly triangular in profile, in section it appears as a squashed (or stunted) H shape. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The butt end measures 24.3 mm in width and is 5.9 mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is a broad U shape and measures 61.9 mm in length. The septum is 5.8 mm deep at the stop ridge and the sides have a depth of 3.7 mm. The flanges may have been misscast or more likely have been lost due to abrasion. The remaining edge is rough and undulating. The side loop measures 27.8 mm in length externally and is 8.6 mm in length internally. It is oval in plan and the arms are broadly circular in section.The loop is situated with one arm level with the stop ridge and the other below. There are no visible casting seems.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 134.8 mm in length, is 34.4 mm wide.It has a maximum thickness of 28.3 mm and weighs 327.9 g.\n\n\n\nThe object is a mid brown to green in colour and has an uneven patina. There is evidence of bright green copper corrosion on the surface of the axehead.On the front of the object, on the right are traces of the original gold coloured patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThis object is similar to the Type Nettleham axeheads illustrated in Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), plate 67, no 930, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 - BC 950. Marking a transition between palstaves and socketed axeheads.
