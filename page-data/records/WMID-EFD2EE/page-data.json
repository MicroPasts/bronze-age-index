There are raised ridges on the outer edge of each side forming a H shape in profile at the butt end. The butt is slightly concave and tapers to a rounded rectangular end. Slightly off centre is a raised horizontal mid rib with a three pronged head decoration, forming a trident pattern and two oval depressions in the surface. The blade is triangular and flares out, the cutting edge is visible, and tapers to a sharp edge.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 53.2 mm in length. It is 16.9 mm wide at the blade, 11.7 mm wide at the midrib, and is 7.1 mm wide at the butt end. The object measures 8.6 mm thick at the midrib, the blade is 2.9 mm thick and the butt is 1.8 mm thick. The axhead weighs 17.4 g.\n\n\n\nThe axhead is a dark green in colour with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movment whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThis object seems to be echoing the style of the Early Palstave, Group III, Low flanged (Broad Bladed) axeheads and is very similar to the Wantage type and it's variants. This type has a broad blade and are decorated with a trident pattern, formed by short mouldings branching from the midrib out towards the corners of the stop. Schmidt (1981) writes that although broad bladed, unlooped palstaves are rare in the Marches and Wales there is enough with a trident pattern to view this area as a source for the type (p 133). He also mentions that unlooped, trident palstaves of Type Wantage are among the earliest broad bladed Palstaves to be produced (p 134). He gives a date for the Low flanged (broad blade) Palstaves beginning in the 14th century B.C and extending into the 13th, which puts it firmly in the Middle Bronze Age (1,600 B.C - 1000 B.C). Similar objects have been recorded in Schmidt (1981), Plate 59, Nos 801 - 808 and page 133. However these recorded examples are of larger Palstave axeheads. A direct comparison for a miniature Palstave of this type could not be found at the time of recording.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K., 1981 The Axes of Scotland and Northern England Munich : Prahistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung.","fourFigureLat":"52.6392994","fourFigureLon":"-2.9028738","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Glenn","datefound1":"September 13, 2017","datefound2":"September 13, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Glenn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pontesbury","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hglenn/WMIDEFD2EE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"53.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
