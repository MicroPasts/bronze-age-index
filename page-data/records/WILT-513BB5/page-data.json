It is complete in itself and consists of four joined hollow arcs, individually C-shaped in profile. The end two have a C shape cut into it with bevelled edges, supporting the abutting of a similar segment on either side. One of the middle arcs has a hole in it where the metal is rather thin (recent-ish damage). The metal is thicker on the underside (3mm).\n\nOn both outer arcs are two c.2.5mm diameter piercings, one of either end of the arc. Presumably these are to secure the attachment of the other segments.\n\nThe segment is 50.4mm long, 15.8mm wide and 12.4mm tall. It weighs 30.38g.","fourFigureLat":"51.105149","fourFigureLon":"-2.187058","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-300","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"July 31, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"28.7","edge":null,"thickness":"8.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Deverill","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Bancroft1006bracelet.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
