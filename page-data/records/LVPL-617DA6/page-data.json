The axehead is most probably of the axe type Arreton which is dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.\n\n\n\nThe object has straight sides, a worn butt end and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders. The cutting edge is broad and crescentic in plan and measures 38.36mm in width. The very edge is worn and incomplete in places The axe has low raised flanges on both faces. The object has a dark brown patina with patches of bright green and light brown corrosion.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 85.03mm; width 19.18mm; thickness 10.06mm; weight 83.51g\n\n\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 415, 422 and 425). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750 - 1600 BC. A similar example which can be found on the database is NMGW-FDBB88.\n\n\n\nSchmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, \"...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembellished faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature. Decoration...becomes a commonplace...\".","fourFigureLat":"53.01992747","fourFigureLon":"-1.7033043","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Heather Beeton","datefound1":"November 20, 2021","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Heather Beeton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.06","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Offcote and Underwood","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Derbyshire Dales","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/heatherbeeton/LVPL617DA6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"85.03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
