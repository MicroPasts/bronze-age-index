It is missing the ends of both lower tips due to old, patinated breaks. The object is cast in the round with a swollen oval body that tapers downwards at both sides to the now incomplete pointed terminals giving it an inverted U-shaped form. At the centre of the body is a slight vertical band or constriction, either side of which the exterior surfaces of the object has decoration comprising multiple ridges and grooves. These run from the central constriction towards the pointed terminals, finishing just before the sides narrow to the terminals. Unlike some parallels, this object is not perforated.\n\n\n\nAll the surfaces of the object have a dark grey green patina, with some pitting and patches of corrosion in places.\n\n\n\nRecord SF-B58222 explains: \"The precise date range of these unusual objects remains uncertain, although several examples have now been recorded through the PAS. Examples from the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998) were found alongside Bronze Age metalwork but with deposition in the Iron Age. Examples from Suffolk (SF-520513 and SF-9183) were found loosely associated with a scatter of Middle Bronze Age finds, as was an example from Methwold, Norfolk, and more recently an example from an excavated Middle Bronze Age context from Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (cf. NMS-F2BA41, NMS-1F5E55). These suggest a possible Middle Bronze Age date for the current object.\"\n\n\n\nCompare also an example on page 8 of the PAS Bronze Age Training Notes (Worrell 2004, unpublished), and LIN-9296A3, NMS-F2BA41 and NMS-1F5E55. There are only other 23 examples on the PAS database (February 2014).","fourFigureLat":"53.63832398","fourFigureLon":"-1.27549822","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"December 17, 2012","datefound2":"December 16, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.05","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thorpe Audlin","county":"Wakefield","district":"Wakefield","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2285_mustache.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"23.45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
