This small artefact tapers to a point which is now missing following an old break.  At the attachment end there are traces of rivet holes which have become abraded.  The holes on the edges echo those of a Bronze Age sword hilt fragment as illustrated in Needham (1990, 50; fig. 65).  The form of the object, however, seems to echo that of a Bronze Age knife as illustrated, for example, in Mills (2000, 19; fig. BR9).  There is bevelling on both faces of the object creating a shallow, almost indiscernible, mid-ridge.  The small artefact is possibly late Bronze Age given the date of the parallel cited from Mills (2000), and was arguably a votive object.","fourFigureLat":"52.252691","fourFigureLon":"-1.09319","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"43","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"January 01, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brockhall","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/NARC-9B13C1kniferev.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"38.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
