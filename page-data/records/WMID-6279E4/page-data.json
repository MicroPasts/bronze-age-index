The blade is broken below the stop ridge, due to this it is uncertain whether this fragment is from a looped - or unlooped palstave variant. The sides of the palstave gently taper from the break to the blade where the tips of the blade protrude markedly. The cutting edge is crescentic and relatively well defined, however it is very worn and the cutting edge is now abraded. Both faces of the axe have single central swollen ribs that extend to above the blade. \n\n\n\nThe palstave fragment has a mid-green coloured slightly abraded patina. \n\n\n\nBurgess and Schmidt (1981) illustrate a number of similar palstaves in their catalogue. The closest parallels can be seen in the classification Primary shield Pattern Palstaves most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5). The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group II type which has a mid rib decoration. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC. There are parallels recorded on the PAS database; for example (WAW-3A6465) was discovered in the Malvern Hills area of Worcestershire. \n\n\n\nThe palstave fragment measures 64.1 mm length, is 60.4 mm wide at the blade, 14.9 mm thick at the broken edge. It weighs 146.7 grams.\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P. K. and Burgess, C. B., (1981) The axes of Scotland and Northern England Munchen : C.H.
