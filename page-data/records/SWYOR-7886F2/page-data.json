Only the middle part of the hammer survives. One end is an incomplete socket os rounded rectangular cross-section. The socket tapers from the broken outer end where it is 32.9mm wide and 16mm thick to 29.4mm wide and 22.8mm thick at the end of the socket. One face of the socket is missing, showing the internal end to be rounded. The solid head of the hammer is irregular and uneven, and may have been mis-cast. It is broadly rectangular in cross-section, but with pieces missing from the edge. It terminates in an old break across a void or bubble in the metal. At the broken end, it is 25.4mm wide and 15.9mm thick. The solid head of th hammer is on a slightly different angle to the socket end. The metal has a light green patina, with a surface layer overlying it in places, of dark grey. The breaks are all patinated and worn. Length 71.0mm, weight 138.05g.\n\n\n\nThe PAS Bronze Age artefact guide (https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/hammers) notes that socketed axes date from 1400 BC - 750 BC, but this one is similar to LANCUM-5AC798 which has been attributed to the Ewart Park phase, 1000 BC - 700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"53.98195714","fourFigureLon":"-2.15397485","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andy Heath","datefound1":"September 17, 2019","datefound2":"September 17, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andy Heath","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coniston Cold","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/phil17/SWYOR7886F2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"71"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
