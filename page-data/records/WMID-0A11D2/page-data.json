The socket is conical and incomplete with part of the reverse section being broken (presumably in antiquity). The surviving socket depth is 67.1 mm. The socket has a circular external as well as internal section. The blade extends at the head of the socket and the overal shape is lost due to abrasion all that remains are shallow crescentic fragments. There is no evidence of side loops, although these may well have been lost through movement in the soil. The socket has two circular peg holes, with an internal diameter of 3.4 mm, one positioned on either side of the socket, beneath the blades. \n\n\n\nIt measures 96.9 mm in length, 17.7 mm wide and is 18.8 mm thick. The metal is 2.2 mm thick. It weighs 47.5 g.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a mid green to brown colour. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is probably too damaged to be specifically attributed to a specific type - however it shares many attributes of the side looped spearheads (of the Acton Park II phase / assemblage) of the Middle Bronze Age as we as that of the pegged spearheads (Penard phases) of the early Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"52.85848251","fourFigureLon":"-1.9568877","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"1000","notes":"The 3D model has been generated using mobile phone scanning application Qlone.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"March 27, 2021","datefound2":"March 27, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stowe-by-Chartley","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID0A11D2.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"96.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
