The side flanges are leaf-shaped in profile and damaged but their highest point is in line with the slight stop ridge which runs across the width of the axehead above the 'septum' or recessed area between the flanges. This ridge would have stopped the wooden haft from shifting on to the septum and the side flanges would have stopped any sideways movement and would help to bind the haft to the axehead. The undecorated septum is slightly lower than the blade. The blade is short, only 35 mm long from the faint stop, but would have originally been more crescentic and has since worn away during use and is now only slightly flanged. The surface of the axehead is quite worn and pitted but there is no active bronze disease.\n\n\n\nNeedham (1979) illustrates similar small axes from Teignmouth in Devon and Gerrans in Cornwall on pages 273-4,  figs.6-7, no.4 which are part of the Arreton repertoire from the early Middle Bronze Age, c.1700-1500 BC.\n\n\n\nMoore and Rowlands (1972) illustrate a similar flanged axe with low side flanges, no stop ridge and a short blade on page 52, pl.VI, no.10, which is dated from the Arreton phase in the early Middle Bronze Age, c.1700-1500 BC.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of haft-flanged axeheads from St Columb, Ladock and Veryan parishes on pages 564, 570 & 580, Plates 3, 9 & 19, nos.31, 78 & 147a, which are dated from the early Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.53081694","fourFigureLon":"-4.85159184","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"September 12, 2015","datefound2":"September 12, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Egloshayle","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Oct15finds073.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"81.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
