This is the tip of the blade and has a low oval cross-section with tapered blades on either side. The front profile narrows to the tip where there is a rounded point. The back end is truncated making it making it difficult to be certain whether this item is from a spear of knife, although the latter is the most likely. This artefact dates to the middle to late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.18617291","fourFigureLon":"-1.88691593","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"May 31, 2016","datefound2":"September 27, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shrewton","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLOD1F7C5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
