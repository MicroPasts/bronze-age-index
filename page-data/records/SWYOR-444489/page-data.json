Only the cutting blade end survives, probably less than half of the whole axehead. The axehead is 58mm long, 68.2mm wide tapering to 48.4mm, 11mm thick and weighs 216g.\n\n\n\nThe axe probably best fits within the Migdale metalworking tradition Type: Migdale - undecorated variant. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II - VI), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2200 - 1700 CAL. BC.\n\n\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with evenly expanding sides that extend to a splayed crescent shaped blade. The butt end is broken. In profile the axe is broadly lentoid with the blade end tapering. In cross section the axe is rectangular with all four faces only very slightly convex.\n\n\n\nThe sides of the axe gently expand evenly in width to a point just above the cutting edge where they become distinctly out-turned / splayed. The long edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge) on either face of the axe. The tips of the blade are in good condition and there are indistinct blade facets on both faces of the cutting edge.\n\n\n\nThe axe has large patches of light green patina surviving, but is a red colour where the patina is missing. The surface is smooth and solid. Although there has been some surface loss there is no evidence of applied incised or hammered decoration. The break is patinated and irregular.\n\n\n\nThe axe can be compared to DENO-830FF8 and HESH-83416C.","fourFigureLat":"53.65611198","fourFigureLon":"-1.2449311","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Scriven","datefound1":"August 10, 2019","datefound2":"August 10, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Scriven","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stapleton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Selby","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR444489BronzeAgeAxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"58"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
