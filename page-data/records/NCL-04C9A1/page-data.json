The entire head has been cast integral, with a conical socket retaining lozenge-shaped sideloops near the base of the socket. A short length of the lower edge of the socket has suffered from damage, which is only mildly abraded. Worn flashmarks are also visible running up the socket from the socket base to the base of the blade, longitudinally in line with the sideloops.\n\n\n\nThe blade is 'leaf-shaped', with angular shoulders, uneven edges, and an extremely worn but pointed tip. The socket extends into the base of the blade, but a low rib running the length of the socket become more prominent as it extends down the length of the blade. The blade appears to have been considerably worn through use (and resharpening?) during its life prior to deposition, as evidenced by the prominence of the rib at the current blade tip. The lower blade, near each shoulder probably retains the original edge of the balde, and the edge of the blade as it continues from each shoulder to the tip can be seen to have been modified, particularly as the angle of the blade increases near the tip.\n\n\n\nThe surface has thick green patches of patina on some sections of the socket and the blade. The rest of the blade has a grey-brown surface where this green patina has already been lost. There are also traces of iron corrosion, which appear to have set into channels formed by corrosion of the copper-alloy, notably on one face of the blade to either side of the rib.","fourFigureLat":"53.18397504","fourFigureLon":"-0.04105561","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"August 06, 2013","datefound2":"September 03, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"17.19","edge":null,"thickness":"1.94","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hameringham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/NCL-04C9A1.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"128.57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
