The object has an I -section with flanges rising on three of its four sides as viewed where it has broken, a result of the uneven break. Two of the flanges, symmetrically or diagonally opposite each other, are grooved on their outer edges. The extent of patination indicates it was broken in antiquity. A hoard of two palstave axes from this parish is currently going through Treasure process, but this object comes from a distinct findspot on higher ground.
