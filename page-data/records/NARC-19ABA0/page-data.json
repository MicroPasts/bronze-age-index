Length 128.1mm, maximum width (at blade end) 42.4mm, maximum thickness (at stop ridge) 31.0mm, weight 323g. The palstave has a square butt with deep pocket. The edges of the flanges are abraded. Decoration on both sides of the blade beneath the curving stop ridge appears to be in the form of a shield combined with a central rib to form a “trident” pattern. Small areas of a patina survive overall. However, the implement is suffering from the effects of bronze disease and is in poor condition.","fourFigureLat":"52.204052","fourFigureLon":"-0.699078","fromdate":"1500","todate":"1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"January 01, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Easton Maudit","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Wellingborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/NARC-19ABA0palstaveprofile.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"128.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
