The mouth is irregular and sub-circular (with an internal diameter of 15mm – 18mm and a maximum thickness of 3.2mm) before a bulbous collar (with a maximum diameter of 26.3mm). The fitting gradually narrows before being near-parallel sided, gently convergent to the break (with a diameter of 16mm – 177mm). Immediately beneath the break are integral lugs now truncated (8mm -9mm long, 4mm thick with a surviving height of 2.3mm). The lugs had a circular perforation, suggesting both may have been loops. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a dark, olive-green patina and areas of pale-green surface loss. Where the surface survives, beneath the loops, there are irregular striations from finishing.\n\n\n\nThe identification and date of the object is uncertain. The looped lugs on opposite sides of a socket is similar to socketed spearheads of Early to Middle Bronze Age date, of Davis’ (2012) Group 2 – 7 of Arreton, Acton Park and Taunton Metalworking, corresponding with Needham’s (1996)[1] Periods 4 -5, and dated to c. 1700 – 1200BC. However a bulbous mouth on a socketed spearhead would be very unusual and is difficult to parallel. Additionally, the narrow looped lugs with thin circular perforations would by unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140","fourFigureLat":"51.853785","fourFigureLon":"-4.8183294","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"26.3","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"New Moat","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017812new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"39.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
