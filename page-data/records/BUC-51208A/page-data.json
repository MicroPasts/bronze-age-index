Only the tip of the spearhead remains, which is triangular in shape, and lozenge in cross section with a worn midrib. The break is worn. An insufficient amount of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed. The tip has a light green patina. The fragment measures 19.6mm in length, 8.2mm in width, and 4.9mm in thickness. It weighs 1.44g.","fourFigureLat":"51.81569364","fourFigureLon":"-0.55070744","fromdate":"1200","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"November 13, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Studham","county":"Central Bedfordshire","district":"Central Bedfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC51208A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"19.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
