The butt is wide and straight (with a width of 50.3mm and a thickness of 4mm). The sides of the axe were near-straight as far as the break and are gradually divergent (with a maximum width at the break of 58.7mm where the axe has a maximum thickness of 8.8mm). The sides are slightly rounded across their depths, producing a sub-rectangular body section. The axe faces are flat across both their lengths and widths, gradually becoming thicker but with no suggestion of a median bevel or similar feature. \n\n\n\nThe surface has a mid-dark brown coarse corrosion with some pale-green corrosion products, possibly indicating copper rather than bronze. \n\n\n\nThe axe form is broad butted and is likely to have been a large example. The axe has few developed features but the thinned butt would perhaps suggest an axe of Type Growtown, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p. 23). The fragmentary condition of the axe makes its exact typological identification using Needham’s (2017) classification uncertain. However the suggested copper metallurgy and wide but thinned butt would suggest a lenticular long-profile and indicate a Class 2 axe and the wide, straight butt would indicate a Class 2A or 2B axe. Chalcolithic axes of Class 2 A / B can be dated to Period 1, c. 2400 – 2200BC and are amongst some of the earliest metal objects recorded from Wales.  \n\n\n\nA study by Needham (2017) listed four axes of Class 2A or B from Wales and the marches, from Shropshire, Flintshire and Powys. This example represents the most south-westerly of the small number of recorded finds.","fourFigureLat":"51.84066855","fourFigureLon":"-4.16420494","fromdate":"-2400","todate":"-2200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanarthney","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/NMWPA201957copy.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"63.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
