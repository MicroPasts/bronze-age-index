The blade is leaf shaped, though the edges are incredibly worn and the tip is missing. Below the blade is a cylindrical shaft which flares towards the base. Midway along the shaft, on either side, are traces of two sideloops. The base is also incredibly worn. The entire object has a dark green patintion with patches of dark brown.\n\n\n\nA few similar examples can be seen on the PAS database, cf.HESH-218915.Similar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (1500 - 1150 BC).This object is therefore likely to be of a similar date.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 64.87 mm; blade thickness: 3.57 mm; socket diameter: 12.34 mm; weight: 12.76g.","fourFigureLat":"51.7924846","fourFigureLon":"0.33311157","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"B.
