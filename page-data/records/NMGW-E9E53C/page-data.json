The butt is straight and like the septum, is thick (with a width of 19.6mm and a thickness of 6.5mm). The sides are straight and gently divergent as far as the stop (where it has a width of 25.1mm). The loop begins before the stop and continues on to the side of the blade (with a length of 26.0mm, a width of 8.8mm, a height of 9.1mm and giving an overall width of 29.7mm). The palstave narrows slightly to the blade (at 19.5mm), after which the sides are gradually divergent and produce a slightly expanded blade edge, with some damage and loss to the blade tips (with a blade edge width of 33.6mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished but are more-finished and barely discernible on the sides of the blade. The flanges rise from well below the butt (13mm) and rise linearly to reach their maximum depth (of 31.1mm) at the stop.  The stop is comparatively straight and is perpendicular to the septum (with a height of 9.6mm). The thick septum is enhanced on both faces with three parallel ribs, beginning at the stop and ending before the flanges start (with a length of 34mm). Both blade faces are decorated with three short, parallel ribs (19.1mm long) beginning beneath the stop. The stop is raised above the blade (3.2mm high) with a near-perpendicular bevel to the blade faces. The blade faces are straight and convergent, before converging more sharply to the blade edge but with a subtle but discernible blade facet. Hammer facets are evident on the blade and occasional striations, possibly from sharpening. The surface has a mid to dark green and black patina with areas of bright green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe palstave has many of the characteristic attributes of ‘Late’ palstaves and the ribbed blade decoration with nipped-in waist under the stop, suggests Type Isleham. The continuation of the ribs on the septum is an unusual feature and is difficult to parallel. The ribbed septum would have helped to eliminate rotational movement when hafted. \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
