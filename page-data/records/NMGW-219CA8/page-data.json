The axe is a plain long socketed type and slender in form. \n\nThe axehead has been damaged and is incomplete missing the mouth and the loop (with a surviving length of 72.6mm and weight of 95.13g). The break is from old damage (where the axe has a maximum surviving width of 29.5mm, thickness of 21.1mm and socket depth of 43.1mm) and has a sub-rectangular section at the break with the end of the bottom loop on one side just before the break. The loop end is corroded and is represented by a small raised stub. The sides of the fragment are bevel slightly to the casting seams (which are smooth, probably hammer-finished) each running the length of the blade on the top and bottom. The sides diverge gently before flaring slightly towards the blade edge (with a blade width of 36.6mm). Towards the blade edge (11.5mm from blade edge) a darker gradient possibly indicates usewear. The blade edge itself is damaged with the original surface having been broken/eroded away through time. \n\nThe faces of the blade are plain with no evidence of ribs. The faces are flat and gradually convergent to the blade edge. Sharpening striations are discernible running along the blade edge. The surface is smooth with a medium green patina with areas near the break on one face and on the top side lost to damage, likely from deposition environment, exposing a rough light green subsurface. Traces of shiny black are visible on one side and inside the socket, possibly from tenorite as seen on other contemporary axes.","fourFigureLat":"51.93213301","fourFigureLon":"-3.48494732","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adelle Bricking","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Glyn Tarell","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/202152.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"72.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
