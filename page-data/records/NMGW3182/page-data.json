There are no ridges or ribs visible on the blade, which has a slightly flattened but rounded cross section. This suggests that the artefact was once a Group IV rapier (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 62). It is not possible to assign this reworked artefact to individual type within the overall group since diagnostic features high up the blade and on the original butt have been lost. The top of the blade fragment has been reworked by flattening the blade, though without splaying it. A new butt was created by inserting two side notches, one on each side of the blade, and 7mm from the top of the blade. These are between 4-5mm long, and concave in outline. The artefact has a black surface patina, and is slightly pitted. One modern scratch has revealed the bronze metal beneath the surface patina. Belongs to the Taunton or Penard phases of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1100 cal BC). Dimensions: length 116mm, maximum blade width 17mm, thickness 2.5mm, butt width 13mm, weight 19.4g.","fourFigureLat":"51.58315752","fourFigureLon":"-3.97872793","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"Group IV rapiers were generally used and deposited during the Taunton and Penard phases of the British Middle Bronze Age (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 106-9).

Examples of Welsh Middle Bronze Age dirks and rapiers within the National Collection come from Llanfair Clydogau, Cardiganshire (Savory 1980, Cat 243), Llansannor, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, Cat 245) and Mynydd Hyddgen, Powys (Savory 1980, Cat 246). Recently a reworked rapier tip from West Cross Beach, Swansea Bay has been added to the collections (unpublished).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"October 03, 1999","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip MacDonald","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Mumbles","county":"Swansea","district":"Swansea","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"116"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
