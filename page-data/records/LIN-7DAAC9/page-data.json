In plan the axe is a slender pointed-oval. The butt is H-shaped in section and terminates towards the centre of the axe with a well-defined, rounded stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum.\n\n\n\nBeyond the septum is a moulded shield-shaped stop-ridge set transversely across the body. The blade is flared and the surface is smooth, bevelled and sharpened.\n\n\n\nThe palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves. These were the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). This particular axehead is probably a Group I (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park or early Taunton phase of Bronze Age metalwork (circa 1450-1300 BC), distinguished by its shield-shaped decoration below the stop ridge (ibid.p.119). \n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.
