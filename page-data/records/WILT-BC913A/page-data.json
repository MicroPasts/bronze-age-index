The awl is square in cross section along most of its length, and tapers to a circular cross-sectioned point at one terminal. At the other terminal it flattens to become rectangular in cross-section, before ending in a chisel-shaped terminal. This end exhibits pitted corrosion, whilst the rest of the awl has a smooth green patina on the surface. It is undecorated.\n\n\n\nThe awl measures 91.94mm in length, 3.85mm in thickness at its mid-point, 1mm in thickness at its chisel-shaped terminal and weighs 7.31g.\n\n\n\nCf. OXON-C4D536 on the database which states: Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Awls are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).","fourFigureLat":"51.00638245","fourFigureLon":"-1.97286895","fromdate":"1150","todate":"801","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Denise Wilding","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Denise Wilding","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.85","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Broad Chalke","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/denisewilding/WILTBC913A.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"91.94"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
