Three pronounced longitudinal ribs extend from the mouth moulding on each face. On one face they bulge slightly along the mid-length, whilst on the other they bend slightly in parallel at the blade end.  External and internal mouth shape is sub-rectangular.  Evidence of only two runner scars on the mouth suggests absence of a four runner casting technology.  In side view, the mouth of one mould piece is higher than the other, giving an angled and irregular mouth surface.  One mould piece is markedly wider and more bulbous at the mouth end than the other, when viewed from the side.  The casting flashes protrude and have only been coarsely trimmed. The axe is rectangular in section with slightly curved side edges.  The sides are divergent and concave in shape, flaring outwards at the blade end, but with no recurving of blade edge visible.  The blade edge is blunt and virtually flat, indicating a lack of preparation for use.  Black encrustation on blade end surfaces.  Rest of axe has green patination overlying a greyish surface with small area of blue colouration on an upper surface between the ribs.","fourFigureLat":"51.47427","fourFigureLon":"-3.426831","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2002","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"74","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welsh St. Donats","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"117.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
