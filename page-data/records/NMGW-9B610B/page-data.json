The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 42.3mm and 22.3mm respectively). The axe has a sub-rectangular section at the break and is of variable wall thickness (1.8mm – 4.3mm).  The surviving parts of the sides are straight and near-parallel before diverging gently to a slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 48.3mm). The sides of the axe are rounded across their thickness with the raised casting seam evident running along the centre and finished. The blade edge has a gentle curve, rounded near the tips. There is the suggestion of a central rib on the more complete face. The faces are slightly convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facets evident. Both faces have deep striations running diagonally along the entire surviving lengths beneath the patina. The surface has dark-green patina surviving elsewhere. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form and suggested ribbed decoration are likely to suggest Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC) and possibly of South Wales or allied axe type.","fourFigureLat":"51.73956157","fourFigureLon":"-2.98620223","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Goetre Fawr","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2016183.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"56.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
