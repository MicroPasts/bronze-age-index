There is no indication of any ribs on either surface, and not enough remains of the shaft to show the collar or side-loop.  The socket is sub-rectangular, but would have probably been circular at the collar.  The dark patina may have been formed as a result of the burial conditions.\n\nThe axe-head appears to belong to Savory’s Late Bronze Age II (c.750-600BC) group of elongated axes with circular, faceted sockets, and bears a great resemblance to nos. 184, 185 and 188 in the National Museum of Wales’ Catalogue of Bronze Age Collections  (fig 24).\n\nThe condition of the axe-head appears to be stable, although somewhat degraded.  The patina has chipped off in several places revealing the greenish, more granular surface beneath.  The presence of fine lines on the brown patina suggests that the axe-head has been subject to some sort of abrasion.","fourFigureLat":"53.206683","fourFigureLon":"-4.202491","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Nina Steele","datefound1":"May 27, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Nina Steele","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pentir","county":"Gwynedd","district":"Gwynedd","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/nsteele/PRN 24082-010.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Gwynedd Archaeological Trust","length":"63"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
