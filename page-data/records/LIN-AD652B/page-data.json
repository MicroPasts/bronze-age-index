It seems to fit into Davis's Group 2 or Group 3 (2017). It has a triangular blade with ribs on each blade wing, and a prominent midrib, lozenge shaped in cross-section. The socket is circular in cross-section and the socket extends just into the base of the blade midrib. There is a side loop on each side of the socket, positioned very close to the end of the object, away from the blade. The spear has a smooth mid green with only slight pitting and corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe spear head is 101 mm long. The blade is 58 mm long and hmm wide, tapering from 17 mm thick at the point where it meets the shaft. The shaft is 43 mm long and has an exterior opening of 26 mm. The interior diameter is 21 mm. The depth of the interior of the socket is 51 mm. The loops measure 20 mm x 7 mm x 7 mm. It weighs 80.17g.\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n\nDavis R (2017) Later Prehistoric Finds Group Object Datasheet No.5; A Short Guide to Early and Middle Bronze Age Spearheads","fourFigureLat":"53.0648949","fourFigureLon":"-0.50912783","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"Davis (2017) notes that \"Spearheads from the earlier MBA were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket.
