The palstave has a deep flange with upright stop; the butt of the palstave narrows slightly from the septum. Casting lines are visible on either side and there does not appear to be a side loop (unlooped palstave). The blade of the palstave flares gently outwards from the stop and although the blade tips are damaged it does not appear to have had a pronounced crescentic cutting edge. There is a narrow linear indentation on one face of the palstave on the blade below the stop which may be the remains of a shield-shaped indent; this is not repeated on the opposing face and therefore may to the result of of an imperfect mould rather than intentional. The flange is c. 77mm tall at the stop, and the back end of the palstave from the stop measures 65mm in length. The blade is 85.6mm long, 55mm wide and 3.2mm thick at the tip. The whole object is 164mm long. The palstave is suffering from bronze disease on all sufaces.\n\n\n\nThe lack of a side loop and lack of any ribs suggest it maybe relatively early and is probably of the Acton Park II period, c.1500-1400 BC. It is perhaps similar to example from Cwm Rheidol, Cardiganshire, and Arthog, Merioneth.
