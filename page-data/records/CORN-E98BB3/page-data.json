The axehead is missing most of its collar and only has two stubs where the integral side loop would have joined them together. The surface is corroded and pitted with patches of light green oxidisation, but most of the dark green surface patina remains on the blade. The longest surviving rib on the face of the axe is 56 mm long and 3 mm wide. The axehead is slender in form and bears features that are most directly comparable with the South Welsh type, such as the three converging ribs, square socket and side loop descending from the collar moulding, which date from the Ewart Park metalwork phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. However, the axe most closely conforms with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981, 173-175) Gwithian type. This type is based on a mould for a slender socketed axe found in the occupation layers at Gwithian, Cornwall (Burgess 1976; Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 174). In the same occupational layer, two Continental bronze pins were also found, which broadly date to the Penard phase of the British Bronze Age (c.1300-1100 BC) (Needham 1981, 34). Thus Gwithian-type axes might predate the typical South Welsh type socketed axes from the Ewart Park phase and could date to the Penard or possible Wilburton phase (1300-1000 BC). Due to the uncertainty around dating these axes, it is perhaps best to give a broad date from 1200-800 BC, which equates to the Middle-Late Bronze Age in Britain. Other Gwithian type axes are known as single finds such as from near Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales (Burgess 1976, 71), and Sedgemoor and Loxton Hill, both Somerset (Pearce 1983, Nos. 673 and 678) (Matt Knight pers comm).\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar socketed axehead with parallel sides, a sub-rectangular section and three converging ribs on each face, from Kingsbridge in Devon, on page 95, pl.15, no.139.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBurgess, C.B. 1976.
