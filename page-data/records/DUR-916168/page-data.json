One end has been bent inwards from an incomplete break at 23mm from the end. Both surfaces appear to be undecorated but there is good evidence of bronze gilding amongst the green-brown surface patination. The bracelet is 69.7mm at its widest and weighs 61.8g. The frame is 15.47mm at its widest, tapering to 8.89mm and 8.98mm at the breaks.\n\n\n\nWith no diagnostic style of terminals to assist in dating, only a broad range of Bronze Age to Roman can be ascribed, although it could equally of later date.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples can be found at LEIC-41C73D, BH-D11A31 and NARC-1C0E84.","fourFigureLat":"54.42238949","fourFigureLon":"-1.89362624","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ann Lipscombe","datefound1":"November 05, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ann Lipscombe","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"69.77","edge":null,"thickness":"5.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"High Worsall","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/benwestwood/DUR916168.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
