The axehead is wedge shaped with a sub-circular socket at the haft end with a circumferential raised mouth moulding. Internally the socket tapers and narrows from the mouth to the cutting edge. Externally the axehead expands gently along the body before widening into the blade and cutting edge which has a slight flare towards each blade tip. To one side of the mouth just below the moulding a D-shape sectioned attachment loop is present and casting flashes remain on both sides including the loop. The surface of the axehead is undecorated.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a shiny blackish-brown patina and is worn. The axehead is 107mm long, the mouth moulding has an external diameter of 31.4mm x 30.6mm, and is 49.8mm wide at the blade. The axehead weighs 166g.\n\n\n\nThis axehead fits into the final phases of the Late Bronze Age specifically that associated with Ewart Park industrial phase.","fourFigureLat":"53.95866026","fourFigureLon":"-0.85845812","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fangfoss","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/TMY0021.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"107"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
