The blade edge is concave with a deep-arched back. The blade tips at both ends may have been elongated, as suggested shallowing to the curve at the back. One tip has a small semi-circular notch (3.3mm diameter), possibly the remnants of a rivet attachment hole and if correct, may suggest a slight tang on that side. There is an irregular long notch (12.5m long and 3.3mm deep) on the top edge, just below the apex and may also be the result of hafting. The blade is thickest at the centre (with a maximum thickness of 4.4mm) and thins at a blade facet on both edges and on both faces. The blade facet has a consistent length (of 7.4mm) along the edge. The surface is more corroded on one face and is dark-green brown with pale. The opposite face has a dark-green patina with a few striations evident running along the blade, possibly from sharpening.\n\n\n\nThe bronze blade is difficult to closely parallel with British archaeological finds but is perhaps best paralleled with Late Bronze Age Hog backed or triangular knives or Racloirs. The blade edge on these examples is usually comparatively straight rather than concave and perhaps suggests a specialised function. The possible rivet indent on one end and damage to the apex, perhaps suggest a tanged knife with handle on one end but covering the top of the blade.","fourFigureLat":"51.59733773","fourFigureLon":"-2.76655802","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 26, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"40.1","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Caerwent","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2017231copy.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"51.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
