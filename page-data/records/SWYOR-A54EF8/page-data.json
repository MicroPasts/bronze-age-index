It fits into the Taunton Metalwork assemblage. The sides of the butt expand into two prominent flanges, each a pointed oval shape viewed from the side. The blade expands into a crescent shaped cutting edge, one tip of which has broken off and is missing.  The cutting edge has a blade facet, and rows of hammer marks are visible on the rest of the blade. The point between the butt and the blade (the stop) is the thickest point of the axe, but the change of angle here is very slight and there is no obvious stop ridge; the flanges extend slightly beyond this point. There is a slight ridge or nick across each side face at the end of the flanges. visible in plan view. The butt tapers from 14.85mm thick at the stop , to 3.3mm at the butt. The internal measurement between the flanges is about 17 at the base and 19mm at the top of the flanges. The flange sides are slightly convex, but the blade sides are straight. The axe has a smooth, dark green patina with a few scratches and gouges. It is 124.2mm long, 56.5mm wide and 28.6mm thick. It weighs 396gm. Compare WMID-11DAE0 and LANCUM-B39815 which notes that winged axes are more common in Northern England in the Taunton Metalwork assemblage. There is no visible decoration.","fourFigureLat":"53.260558","fourFigureLon":"-1.236923","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"July 14, 2012","datefound2":"July 19, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jack Coulthard","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Elmton","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Bolsover","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wakefield/PAS_1950_axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"142.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
