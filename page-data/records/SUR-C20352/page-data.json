The axe is complete, except for the tip of the butt, and in good condition although the surfaces are now very rough. The length of the axe is 143.16mm and the width of the blade is 61.56mm. The thickness is 28.97mm and the axe weighs 359g. The axe has a central raised rib and raised sides. The septum measures c7.5mm above the stop ridge. There is a casting void behind the stop ridges.\n\n\nPeter Reavill comments:\n\n\nThis is anearly mid rib palstave  - the raised sides are prominent and a little  odd - but generally OK. The look of this axe is slightly strange  though with the prominent stop ridge that extends out in profile and the apparent casting flaws either side of the mid rib. This comes from  the end of the sequence of unlooped palstaves - most probably type Liswerry or possibly Southall (plate 57 Schmidt and Burgess)","fourFigureLat":"51.243598","fourFigureLon":"-0.153271","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.97","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Nutfield","county":"Surrey","district":"Tandridge","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCN6819.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"143.16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
