The awl tapers in plan from the rounded spatulated end which is 14.6 mm wide, and sub-rectangular in section, to the pointed end which is 3 mm wide and circular in section. The awl is heavily patinated and has taken a lot of damage around the nib leaving it distorted and with several deep cuts across its surface. Some awls may have been hafted in to a wooden or bone handle and this flattened butt end may have made for better hafting. Plain copper-alloy awls are hard to date precisely, but ones of this form are known to have been introduced in the Bronze Age with most being later Middle to Late Bronze Age in date c.1150-800 BC. The form changes little throughout time, however, and post-Bronze Age examples are also known.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar awl with a chisel-like opposite end from Tarrant Rushton in Dorset on page 103, pl.30, no.314, recorded in DOR-6DF7F6 and dated from the Middle to Late Bronze Age, c.1500-800 BC.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples have been recorded on the PAS database, including SF-333182 from Suffolk, SWYOR-55A4B7 from Yorkshire, and WILT-97977D from Wiltshire.","fourFigureLat":"50.20224624","fourFigureLon":"-5.36454385","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as \"pointed punches\" by Coles (1963-64 117), they were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"December 31, 2017","datefound2":"December 31, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gwinear-Gwithian","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN6048.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"98"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
