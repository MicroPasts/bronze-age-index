It is of heavily corroded condition, with thin green patination. The extensive surface loss is due to exposure to (now) marine deposition, this is likely to have formed part of a&nbsp;funerary&nbsp;group of implements deposited at the site known as Seahenge, Holme-Next-The-Sea, cf. Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 82, Robertson. D,(2016), pp 227-258 ,&nbsp;original deposition&nbsp;at the time was inland.&nbsp;\n\nThe H-sectioned split hafting has now corroded to a thin irregular form, the blade is rather smooth with shallow, broad pits and the cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical, it is unsure if the this was intentional or just due to the corrosion. See&nbsp;NMS-C9B2AD for an example of this type&nbsp;found in Norfolk in better condition.","fourFigureLat":"52.97507337","fourFigureLon":"0.54528118","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"Association with &quot;Seahenge&quot; monument.&nbsp;","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"January 01, 2000","datefound2":"December 31, 2001","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Jason Gibbons","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Holme Next the Sea","county":"Norfolk","district":"King's Lynn and West Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jasongibbons/DSCF90642.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"144"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
