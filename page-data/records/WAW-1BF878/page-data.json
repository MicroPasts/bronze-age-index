The mouth of the axe is sub square in plan with rounded corners, and on the mouth there is evidence of two casting jets, one on each side edge. The mouth, on the outer faces appears to be semi-circular in section and is slightly wider than the body of the axe itself. The surface of the socket is rough and is encrusted. There are also traces of what may be the casting residue. In profile the axe is triangular with a casting seam visible on both sides. There are no traces of a side loop. The body faces are undecorated and are trapezoidal in plan. The cutting edge is slightly convex, but it has the remains of the casting seam along it. The surface of the axe has traces of active corrosion, pitting and a well developed patina, but the majority of the surface is abraded and perhaps over cleaned revealing traces of fresh metal. It measures 57.76mm long, 36.32mm wide, 33.79mm thick and weighs 110.2g. The depth of the socket is 40.96mm deep.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill and Phil Watson comment the mouth of the axe is unusually wide, and that the shape is oddly 'stubby'. The blade has never been sharpened, and that in combination with the shape suggests it may have been made for use as a votive offering rather than a functional axe. It is probably dated to the late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nAs a note a similar shaped axe was recorded from the same parish which has similar dimensions, but does appear to be a functioning axe.","fourFigureLat":"52.01331652","fourFigureLon":"-2.16168564","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"November 29, 2012","datefound2":"February 27, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"33.79","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Twyning","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Tewkesbury","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-1BF878a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"57.76"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
