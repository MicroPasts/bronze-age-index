This is probably a blade of  Bronze Age date, suggested by the patina of the copper alloy. The object is triangular in section, being 6mm thick at its widest and tapering to a sharp narrow convex edge. The widest edge is slightly convex. It is eliptical in plan.\n\n\nit is 41mm long, 13mm wide and 66mm thick. It weighs 8.66g.\n\n\nNo exact replica has been found for this object. It is possibly the blade edge of a Bronze Age axe head. However, the wede edge is very regular and unliley to be a broken edge. The Bronze Age Finds Advisor of teh British Museum has been asked for an opinion and possible parallels and this record will be updated on his reply.","fourFigureLat":"52.223972","fourFigureLon":"-0.888817","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Cassidy","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Cassidy","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"NORTHAMPTON","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Northampton","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jcassidy/BA a.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
