The blade is trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the broken edge. The blade was originally crescentic with expanded pointed terminals but has been worn to rounded terminals. The blade narrows towards the broken end, which is below where the transverse stop ridge would have been, stopping the haft or handle from sliding down the blade when the axe was being used. The blade is too corroded and pitted to see if there was any decoration at the narrower broken end between the flanges.\n\n\n\nFlanged axes with crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig.28, no.89).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar flanged axe with wide transverse grooves on the blade from Staxton in North Yorkshire in plate 33, no.411, which is classified as a Type Arreton long flanged axe and dated from the Arreton metalwork phase, which now dates from c.1700-1500 BC (Matt Knight pers comm).\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar low flanged axehead with crescentic blade from Christchurch in Dorset on page 88, pl.15, no.227.","fourFigureLat":"50.32869288","fourFigureLon":"-4.22119839","fromdate":"-1950","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"July 31, 1994","datefound2":"March 30, 1995","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Maker-with-Rame","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN5976.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
