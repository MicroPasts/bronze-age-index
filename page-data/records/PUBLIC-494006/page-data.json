The butt is rounded (with a width of 11mm) and the axe is of sub-rectangular section. The axe has discernible median bevels on both faces (28mm from the blade). The sides are near-parallel as far as the median bevel (where the axe has a width of 13.3mm and has a maximum thickness of 6.5mm). From the bevel, the sides are straight and divergent to the blade edge. The blade edge is moderately curved (with a width of 16.9mm) and no blade facet is now discernible, there are no flanges evident on the axe. Very little of the original surface survives with a dark brown patina; elsewhere the surface is pitted and is pale to mid green.\n\n\nThe axe is of a diminutive size, even for Type Bandon, Variant Swinton and it remains unclear whether the axe had a practical purpose or was votive. It is possible that the 'axe' may have been used for delicate tasks, perhaps similar to a chisel. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is two-thirds of the size of these axes, it may have been used for a similar function.","fourFigureLat":"52.07204898","fourFigureLon":"-3.00810352","fromdate":"-2050","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 22, 2010","datefound2":"July 14, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dorstone","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.4.2i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"58.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
