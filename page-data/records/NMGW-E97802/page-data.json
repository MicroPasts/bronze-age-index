The dirk has a plain ogival shaped blade with a rounded central rib producing a flattened lozenge cross-section. The butt no longer survives, however the blade size and shape suggest it to be a Group II dirk (Burgess & Gerloff 1981). The butt has corroded to a trapezoidal form, although this should not imply any similarity to the butt when complete. None of the corroded notches around the butt can be positively identified as rivet holes, however it is tempting to see the arc near the top of the dirk as the possible remnants of a rivet hole. The condition of the dirk is generally poor with large areas of the surface missing, and has an orange-brown patination.","fourFigureLat":"51.84603","fourFigureLon":"-4.353209","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1200","notes":"Most dirks of group II can be confidently ascribed to Acton Park metalworking tradition although occasional examples have been found associated with Taunton phase metalwork (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, p44-45). This example is likely to date from Period 5 (Needham 1996), and was probably produced sometime between 1500 and 1200 BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2001","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Carmarthen","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn1189.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"140.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
