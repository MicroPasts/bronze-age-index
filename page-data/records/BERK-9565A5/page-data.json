The blade is a pointed oval in plan with clearly defined angled edge bevels. The midrib is angled and extends from the socket to the tip creating a lozengiform cross-section to the blade. Approximately halfway down the socket are the side loops. The side loops are lozengiform in plan and almost flat in cross-section. Small sections of the edge of the socket are broken and missing. Dark green patina. The spearhead is similar to one found in County Limerick, Ireland however on this example the blade is less angular and the side loops are orientated further down the length of the socket (Allen, Britton & Coghlan 1970: 168). Dimensions: length: 125.38mm; weight: 41.39g (including soil in socket). Reference: Allen, I., Britton, D. Coghlan, H. 1970.
