The jet is derived from casting in bronze.  The jet is oval in plan, slightly concave on its upper surface and convex on its underside representing the depression in the clay or other mould material which was filled with molten metal.  Projecting from the convex underside is an irregularly shaped runner.  The runner is roughly oval in plan with a clean, slightly curved terminal.  The surface of the terminal is much smoother than the rest of the object, suggesting that it was cut at this point to detach the runner from the freshly cast object.  There is possibly the remains of another runner, represented now but just a slight oval bump on the underside next to the existing runner.  The jet has an uneven, irregular surface with an even mid-green-brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"53.44374","fourFigureLon":"0.01605","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fulstow","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/2018_0227_131919AA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"24"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
