The chisel has a tang with a rectangular cross section which has broken 13.4mm from a transverse collar. This collar is sub-oval in cross-section and is 10.2mm wide. The blade itself expands from 6.0mm wide at the collar to 11.9mm wide at the cutting edge which has lost one side. The side profile of the blade is slightly curved, although it is not possible to tell if this is an original feature.","fourFigureLat":"51.26516247","fourFigureLon":"-0.39608533","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"Tanged chisels of this type are uncommon finds; examples recorded on the database include BH-49EAD8, NMS-5059F9, SUR-E710D7 and BERK-52E8C3.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"April 13, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bookham South","county":"Surrey","district":"Mole Valley","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR101EF6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"50.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
