The form corresponds to Davis’ (2012) Group 6 (Developed side-looped) and is most probably a product of the later Arreton, Acton Park, Taunton or early Wilburton metalworking phases (Needham’s (1996) Periods 4-5, c 1500-1100 BC). The remaining portion is 74.5mm in length, with a socket of 15.8mm diameter which is completely infilled with sediment. The blade was leaf shaped and 20mm in width with a pronounced mid rib; only the rear quarter to a third remains, with a clean break across the width. There are two small and narrow flanking side loops around half way along the tapering conical socket, one of which has a casting flaw behind it in the form of a hole. No trace of any material the shaft was found in the socket during conservation.","fourFigureLat":"51.20337617","fourFigureLon":"-1.55766402","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"\nAdditional images on this record show the find after museum conservation.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Monxton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslinhct/HAMPA65276.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"74.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
