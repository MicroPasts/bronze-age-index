One end (the wider, 9.6mm wide) is broken (recent-ish) and the strap then tapers to an end 4.2mm wide with a broken loop (also recent-ish) projecting from it (internal diameter c.2.2mm). The long edges are finished. One face has an indented line flanking the long edges and curving round behind the projecting loop. Measures 32.3mm in length and weighs 1.24g. It is rather dented in places and the finder says it was folded when he found it. He thought it was a piece of gold foil and unfolded it.\n\n\nTreasure report written by Dr S.P. Needham: The fragment comprises one end of a ribbon of gold the sides converging in a convex curve towards a perforated terminal. The long edges are thickened outside a light crease inset by 1mm. The terminal's end has been torn off leaving just half of the perforation extant.\n\n\nThe ribbon has a number of buckles and a partial fracture crossing transversely at one point.","fourFigureLat":"51.141093","fourFigureLon":"-2.201498","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Treasure report written by Dr S.P. Needham: This is very likely to be an ancient object (over 300 years old) and may be of future research interest if better parallels come to light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incomplete nature of this object and the lack of diagnostic features makes it difficult to identify its original form. A range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings. It is possible that the Brixham Deverill fragment belongs to this repertoire and the composition of the metal would not be inconsistent with such a date.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 85-87 %, a silver content of 11-13 %, the remainder being copper. The fragment weighs 1.23 grams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTVC recommended valuation: Â£20","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"August 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brixton Deverill","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Treasure Bancroft.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"32.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
