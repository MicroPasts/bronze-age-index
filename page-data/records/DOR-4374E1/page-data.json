This axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, but not recurving. Cast flanges extend along the sides,arching from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a very shallow lenticular side profile. The flanges&nbsp;are slightly angled inwards on both faces.&nbsp;The axe has a very low ridge about two thirds of the way along the septum ( 42 mm from the butt)&nbsp;which may indicate the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. The surfaces are is&nbsp;pitted in some areas and there is some damage and loss to the but, cutting edge and flanges. Possibly a Needham Class 4C.\nDate:&nbsp;Early Bronze Age (MBA I) c.1900-1800&nbsp;BC\n\nDimensions: 94.52 mm x 43.79 mm x 12.54 mm\nWeight: 132.07\n\nSimilar to DOR-A727D7","fourFigureLat":"50.69040026","fourFigureLon":"-2.539322","fromdate":"-1900","todate":"-1800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.54","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winterborne St. Martin","county":"Dorset","district":"West Dorset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/caht/4374E1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"94.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
