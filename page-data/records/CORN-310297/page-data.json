The collar and the upper half of the axe is missing and there three fragments of more of the wall of the axe that also survive. The lower half that survives is sub-rectangular in plan, triangular in profile and the socket is almost square in section. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The sides of the axehead are straight and almost parallel but expand slightly towards the blade making the cutting edge a little crescentic, which is probably the result of sharpening during use. The cutting edge is also slightly damaged although this appears to be limited to the surface corrosion and is more likely the result of soil movement and of agricultural equipment since depostion than of use. A longitudinal linear casting seam is visible on one side but the other side is pitted and more worn. Most of the surface is oxidized to a pale green with a few patches of dark green patina.\n\n\n\nThe narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar Armorican socketed axes from Carn Brea, in Cornwall, on page 424, plates 16-17, nos.129a & c.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate similar socketed axes from Cornwall on pages 38 & 97, plate 24, nos.100-101.","fourFigureLat":"50.13776804","fourFigureLon":"-5.41600381","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Dudley","datefound1":"October 14, 2018","datefound2":"November 14, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Dudley","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"22","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Erth","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN7295.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"67.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
