The wheel has a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate, narrowing as they do, before joining the outer rim. The holes between each of the axel are sub-oval, almost pointed ovals. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle (c.3.0mm diameter) this shows little sign of ware.\n\n\n\nThe wheel has a dark brown patina with some thicker patches of dark green patina.\n\n\n\nThe wheel is 20.3mm in diameter, 2.0mm thick and weighs 2.37 grams\n\n\n\nThere are a growing number of examples of votive wheels on the database. Particularly similar examples to this object include GLO-E82DE1, KENT-9348EE, KENT-70F063, SF-987EE3 and NMS-1CDC66. However,  SWYOR-0B3992, whose additional hole may suggest it was a pastry jigger, and NLM-B563BC, which has an Iron axel suggesting it is the wheel for a toy cannon, demonstrate that such a form is shared by artefacts of other dates and purposes. Later Prehistoric examples can also take different forms including three spokes (e.g. SOM-C30265) or be more bulbous (e.g. HESH-C53CF4).  \n\n\n\nA tin example of a wheel, not dissimilar to this example, has been found at Flag Fen (Pryor 2001: 272-273, No.154) which cites parallels found in Late Bronze Age contexts in Switzerland (Pryor 2001: 291). A further example of this type is held by the British Museum (accession No. 1989,0601.21) found in an Iron Age Hoard while a more bulbous example is held by the British Museum (Accession NO. 1864,0501.11). This is part of the Hounslow Hoard â€“ (which may be two separate hoards) which also contained Late Bronze Age and Iron Age artefacts.","fourFigureLat":"51.44585096","fourFigureLon":"-1.48338061","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"August 31, 2019","datefound2":"February 20, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"20.3","edge":null,"thickness":"2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kintbury","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON5C8F8B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
