The hilt of the sword is formed from a straight bar (45mm long), the forward side of which tapers into the narrow grip. The grip is 75mm long and has slightly convex sides, bring at the thickest two thirds along its length. There is a line of three rivet holes in the centre of the grip. The grip leads onto the hilt of the sword that expands outwards with straight angled edges and two rivet holes on each side. Form the hilt the sides curve down to the leaf shaped blade which is 29mm wide near its base and gently expands to 39mm wide at the final quarter before rapidly narrowing to the pointed tip. In cross-section the blade has a low oval shape with pointed tips that have bevelled edges.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis item has been broken into seven separate parts, at each of the breaks the sword has been bent by between 30-40 degrees in order to achieve the break. This is not post-depositional damage but a premeditated act prior to loss/burial. Similar post-depositional ritualistic acts can also be seen on Bronze Age items LVPL-55FB97, HAMP-24C69E and GLO-7EFE1A.","fourFigureLat":"52.04613044","fourFigureLon":"-2.87628591","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"January 17, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Informed finder that the object should be submitted as Treasure","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Madley","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO37B31F.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"587"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
