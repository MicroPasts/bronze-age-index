It has a rounded sub-rectangular opening with a prounced lip. The body is decorated with three horizontal ribs. The blade flared, but the cutting edge is rather narrow, suggesting that it has been reground several times. A side loop is located close to the socket on one side. A casting seam is also visible down the centre of the sides.\n\n\n\nThis axe was found in the early 1900s in the Bardney/Barlings area. No further details exist. This record was created using photographs supplied by a family member of the finder.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Barlings","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN-87F4F5_front.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"85"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
