Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face of the ingot is smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and coppery red areas of decay, and the sides and the base of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, PLate 36, Nos.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork, and an ingot fragment from Churston Ferrers, Torbay on page 457, Plate 40, No.306b, which was found with a larger plano-convex ingot.\n\n\n\nThe analysis by Camborne School of Mines below shows that the ingot is made of almost pure copper, which also suggests that it dates from the Late Bronze Age (Dr. Peter Northover pers comm).","fourFigureLat":"50.77425937","fourFigureLon":"-3.30613864","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"Report from X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy analysis by Kathryn Moore at Camborne School of Mines:\n\n\n\nCopper 93.82% / Iron 0.062% / Selenium 0.06% / Nickel 0.038% / Bismuth 0.021%\n\n\n\nBalance (gasses etc) 5.96%","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"August 23, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"21","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ottery St. Mary","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/nov13finds12.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"70"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
