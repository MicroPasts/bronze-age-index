It is in the form of a narrow isosceles triangle with a mid rib down the centre on each face of the blade. The patina is glossy dark-brown in colour with some areas of blue green active corrosion. It is 50.5mm in length, 16.6mm wide, and 6.7mm thick. It weighs 10.07gm. The mid rib cross section is a diamond or lozenge (square rotated by 45 degrees). It is impossible to assign a type from such a small fragment (Worrall 2004, Finds Recording notes, unpub.), but the extent of the midrib and the narrowness of the blade suggests it is no earlier a type than Davis Group 6.","fourFigureLat":"53.38657756","fourFigureLon":"-1.26474255","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"February 18, 2009","datefound2":"February 18, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thurcroft","county":"Rotherham","district":"Rotherham","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 989 spear tip.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"50.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
