The object has a slightly tapering sub- circular section and is turned inwards to form an open loop. The object has flat terminals which are aligned almost parallel, tapering inwards slightly at their inner edge and are set 4mm apart.\n\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of the penannular ring carried out by the British Museum's Department of Conservation and Scientific Research indicated a gold content of 82-85%, silver content of 12-14%, the remainder being copper. The ring weighs 6.06 grams and the specific gravity measurement of 17.49 indicates that it is gold alloy throughout, not plated.\n\n\nIt is 22mm long, 15mm wide, 5mm thick and weighs 6.06g.","fourFigureLat":"52.712171","fourFigureLon":"-1.23172","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"As the object is made of over 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"August 17, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Woodhouse","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Charnwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/4AB781.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"22"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
