The flanges begin about three quarters&nbsp;of the way along the butt&#39;s length.&nbsp;The casting seam is visible along the sides of the axehead.&nbsp;The stop is pronounced and overhangs a little.&nbsp;The stop has rounded&nbsp;corners with the flanges. The loop survives only as residual stumps on one side, and originally arced over the position on&nbsp;the stop. The blade is quite thick&nbsp;before flaring out at the blade end into a curved cutting edge. There is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade.\n\nThe axehead has a heavily mottled patination of mid green overlain with a patchy brown layer. It has corroded quite badly and exhibits damage and wear that suggests the object has spent some time in an active ploughed environment.&nbsp;\n\nTotal Measurements:&nbsp;126mm long, 30.9mm wide at the loop, 35.47mm wide at blade edge, 28.12mm thick at stop, and 300g in weight","fourFigureLat":"51.37555314","fourFigureLon":"0.02446052","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Steven Nye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bromley Common and Keston","county":"Greater London Authority","district":"Bromley","regionName":"London","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lrogerson/KENT4E0C1E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"126"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
