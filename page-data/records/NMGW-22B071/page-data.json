(1996) Period 5; c. 1500-1150 BC. The palstave is of an early type and is unlooped, and is also without either a shield pattern or a mid-rib on the blade. The palstave would appear to belong to Group III palstaves of Low-Flanged (Broad-Blade) form, the lack of cast blade decoration on this example makes it difficult to categorise to a specific type, but would appear to be dated to c. 1350-1200BC.  \n  The palstave is relatively slight, compared to the more massive Acton Park type. The sides are parallel as far as the stop, and then gradually diverge to a slightly expanded blade. The blade edge is gently curved with a long (14mm) blade facet. The blade sides have been pronounced on the upper blade, forming low ribs. The bar stop is straight and meets the flange at a right angle; on the blade side, the stop is near vertical before arcing to the blade face and forming a ‘bar ledge stop’. The flanges are low, as defined by the type, and diverge laterally to a diagonal step before the stop. The butt is eroded, but seems to have had a V-shaped nick. The sides are slightly rounded and convex. The casting seams are discernible but largely eroded. One side appears wider on one half of the mould side than the other. Much of the surface of the palstave has been lost, but survives to a greater extent on one face and appears to have a black patchy coating or patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.684491","fourFigureLon":"-5.111647","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"The palstave is of particular interest because of the unusual absence of cast decoration on the face, and together with the lack of a loop, possibly suggests an earlier date within the type. The relatively sophisticated form and profile however may hint at a slightly later date. Whilst Low-Flanged palstaves are not uncommon finds from the welsh Middle Bronze Age (some 120 recorded examples), a palstave without the characteristic ornament or loop makes the find of archaeological interest and difficult to parallel with known examples.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"December 01, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Angle","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2037.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"122.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
