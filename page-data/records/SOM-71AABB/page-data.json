It then tapers inwards to form two C-shaped notches on either side which are the remains of two broken rivets holes used as the attachment point for the missing handle. Both rivets are missing, and the holes are too fragmented to accurately estimate their diameter.\n\n\n\nFrom these rivet holes the sides of the rapier expand into the shoulders of the blade. The maximum width of these shoulders is 27.1mm. From the shoulders the edge of the rapier narrows into the blade. From this point the blade itself tapers in width more gradually to almost have straight edges towards the end of the blade, the tip of which is missing. The blade is pointed oval in cross-section with no clearly defined mid-rib or edge bevels.\n\n\n\nThe object has a dark green patina which is particularly thick on the blade close to the rapier's shoulders. On the hilt area are concreted deposits which may be the remains or organic material preserved by copper salts. The majority of the blade's edge on all fragments shows chips, notches and damage but these may be due to post depositional damage. The maximum surviving width of the blade from midrib to edge is 17.1mm and it is maximum thickness is 7mm.\n\n\n\nThe longest fragment of the blade is bent so that it now forms a gentle curve when viewed in profile. The bending of the blade this way, and the snapping of it, into multiple fragments may have been deliberate although the fragments were found together and still fit together.\n\n\n\nThe total length of the rapier measures 184.9mm while the surviving portion of the blade is 157.9mm long. Both these figures would have been longer if the longest section of the blade were not bent. The blade has a maximum width of 4.7mm and a minimum width of 2.1mm. It minimum thickness is 1.96mm and its maximum thickness is 6.8mm. The rapier weighs 29.35g.\n\n\n\nThe object is likely a Group IV blade, with a comparable example no.864 from Undley, Suffolk (Burgess and Gerloff 1981, Plate 107). Close parallels include SOM-EECC89, a complete GLO-036A39 and pieces of two further such implements SUR-A18104/Treasure case 2015 T331. All of these rapiers are of similar form, being of Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV (1981) and dating to the period c. 1500-c. 1150 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.10193381","fourFigureLon":"-2.88687454","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"September 05, 2018","datefound2":"December 06, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Middlezoy","county":"Somerset","district":"Sedgemoor","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM71AABBsection.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"184.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
