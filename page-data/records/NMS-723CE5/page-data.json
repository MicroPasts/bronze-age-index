The cross-section is D-shaped, at most 5mm thick and 7mm wide. The inner face is much better preserved and appears very slightly convex. The internal diameter is very regular and 24mm in diameter. The external diameter was at least 33mm, but as so little of the surface now survives it may originally have been 35mm in external diameter or more. It weighs 16.69g. The patina is a pale green, characteristic of a Bronze Age to Roman date.
