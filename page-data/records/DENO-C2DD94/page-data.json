The fragment comprises the cutting edge, blade, blade tips and just the lower portion (approx 11 mm) of the body.\n\n\n\nThe cutting edge is crescent shaped, the blade flares out to the tips. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have not been worked down and remain fairly prominent, there is little sign of overall wear on the blade. The body is sub rectangular in section, as is the internal socket end. The whole object has a well formed, dark brown patina. Although it is difficult to determine from a fragment, the axehead  probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).\n\n\n\nWidth blade tip to blade tip 50.2 mm, body width 34.9 mm, length  24.5 mm, thickness 13.3 mm.
