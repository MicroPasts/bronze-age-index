The spearhead has broken through the central circular socket (with an internal diameter of 11.1mm and a surviving depth of 19.6mm). The position of the socket is marked by a prominent, rounded midrib (with a width of 11mm, a height of 3mm and giving a maximum surrounding overall depth of 12.0mm). The midrib gradually narrows as it approaches the tip (with a width of 7mm at the break) but retains its height. The blade edges are lost but the surviving edges suggest they may have been straight and gradually convergent to the tip, producing a triangular form to the upper part of the spearhead. If the straight blade edge continued to the tip, some 49mm of the tip have been lost. The spear is solid at the upper break (with socket terminating 33mm below the break and with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 8.6mm). The blade edges had prominent facets, preserved over much of the blade. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running along the blade, partially preserved on both faces.  The surface is has a dark-green patina, possibly with tin surface enrichment in areas. \n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the spearhead makes typological identification difficult but the form is consistent with spearheads of Middle and Late Bronze Age date, c. 1500 â€“ 700BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.54784751","fourFigureLon":"-3.28491027","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llantwit Fardre","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"55.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
