The rear part of the axe (57mm length; 26mm width; 9mm thickness)is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-rectangular in profile, with the thickest part (31mm thickness)immediately behind the stop ridge. The blade (72mm length; 34mm width; 13mm thickness)is sub-triangular in profile. In plan, the blade is sub-rectangular and gently splays towards the cutting edge. As the blade is broken, it may well have splayed more towards the cutting edge. A central ridge runs from the stop ridge along the length of blade. The side loop has broken off, but it is possible to see traces of where it once was. A similar axe, found together with other Bronze Age items by workmen in 1879 at Sherford, Devon, is illustrated in Pearce 'The Bronze Age Metal Work of South Western Britain'(please see reference for details). Although Pearce's example splays more towards the cutting edge, the rectangular plan of the butt; straight stop ridge; central ridge on the blade; and the profile are all similar to this example.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Danielle Wootton","datefound1":"June 22, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Danielle Wootton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aylesbeare","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwootton/DEV-105E82 bronze age axe head.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"129"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
