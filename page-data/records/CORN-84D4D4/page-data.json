The palstave has a squared-off protruding stop ridge and rectangular aperture in plan and a narrow parallel-sided blade which is inset from the stop ridge in profile as well as plan, and starts to expand only slightly towards the blade edge after 40 mm but the rest of the blade is missing. The remains of the side loop project outwards 5 mm from the surface of one side of the palstave and the base of the other end of the loop is 2.5 mm proud of the surface. The surface of the blade is damaged and pitted but does not appear to have been decorated.\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar palstaves with squared-off stop ridges and narrow inset blades from Denwick and Wallington Demesne in Northumberland in plate 64, nos.880-881, which are classified as Transitional Palstaves, Type Shelf, Plain Variant and dated from the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age, and another from Keswick, Cumbria in plate 67, no.933, which is classified as a Late Palstave, Type Shelf and dated to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate palstaves with side loops and narrow blades from Iwerne Minster in Dorset on p.91, pl.18, no.265 (see DOR-8D4C40) and from Christchurch, Dorset on p.93, pl.20, no.228, which are dated from the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.08050681","fourFigureLon":"-5.21620138","fromdate":"-1275","todate":"-1020","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"September 12, 2018","datefound2":"September 12, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Undergoing further examination at a museum","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gweek","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN6846.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"93"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
