The surface is heavily pitted and corroded on one side so that less of the dark brown patina survives. The cutting edges of the fragment are also jagged and damaged. The fragment dates from the Middle Bronze Age, but to be sure of its date, it will need more metallurgical analysis.\n\n\n\nRohl and Needham (1998) illustrate some similar rapiers with broad mid-ribs on p.132, fig.34, nos.189-190, which are Group IV rapiers, and date from the Penard phase of metalwork, c.1275-1150 BC. \n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate rapiers with narrow blades and broad mid-ribs from Sennen in Cornwall and Exmouth in Devon on p.98, pl.25, nos.71 & 134.\n\n\n\nDr Matt Knight's research has suggested that rapiers carried on in use over longer periods of time where early swords did not develop. This is true of Scotland, but also of the South West so it is possible to suggest that rapiers continued to be used in these areas into the Wilburton (c.1150-1020 BC) phase of the late Middle Bronze Age (Matt Knight pers comm).","fourFigureLat":"50.08948628","fourFigureLon":"-5.21680296","fromdate":"-1275","todate":"-1020","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"September 12, 2018","datefound2":"September 12, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Undergoing further examination at a museum","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gweek","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/rapier.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
