It comprises a strip of sheet gold with a jagged transverse break across one end and folded horizontally so that the corners overlap. At one end are two small perforations, possibly rivet holes. \n\n\n\nDimensions: Length (folded): 10.2mm, maximum width: 14mm, minimum width: 13mm, thickness: 1mm, weight: 1g. \n\n\n\nDiscussion: A number of similar objects have been reported as potential Treasure and are recorded on the PAS database including: HAMP-B9814B (2018 T700), SUR-DE6DF2 (2017 T644), BH-1BE953 (2014 T901); this last states: “There is a range of gold strip and ribbon ornaments datable to the British Bronze Age. The less numerous types include arm and possibly ear ornaments fastening by means of a hook at each end, or a hook and eye (piercing)… There are also an increasing number of (often) thin gold strips and fragments with terminal piercings which on grounds of composition could fit into a Bronze Age context. Again, there are continental analogues, beginning within the Early Bronze Age sheet gold tradition.”\n\n\n\nDate: c. 1500 – 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.87726826","fourFigureLon":"1.2381296","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"The object appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"August 24, 2018","datefound2":"August 24, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sustead","county":"Norfolk","district":"North Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ellmcdonald/39540_A3603B_UNK_Unidentified.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"10.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
