The length is 54mm, the width is 12mm thickness 8mm and the weight 14.64g. Tanged chisels, which date from c. 1150-850 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds. Several tanged chisels, or elements of them, are recorded on this database (for example, see BH-49EAD8). Tanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC, but maybe much later. Similar to SUR-435CC1 and ESS-159732.","fourFigureLat":"53.51925344","fourFigureLon":"-3.02705851","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"February 01, 2018","datefound2":"February 01, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ince Blundell","county":"Sefton","district":"Sefton","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM8A0D61.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"54"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
