Axe head type not further defined, possibly a fragment of socketed axehead. The fragment is the blade end of the axehead with a ragged transverse break cutting across its body.  There is no trace of a socket at this broken end. Beyond the break the axe widens in smooth concave curves to the blade edge which is crescent shaped. \n\nLength: 26.6 mm\n\nWidth: 48.6 mm\n\nThickness: 10.9 mm\n\nWeight: 53.6 g\n\n\n\nDr Edward Caswell comments: Given the extent of the curve of the blade and the even thickening towards the centre in cross section, the fragment is likely to be from a Late Bronze Age (c.1150 - 800 cal BC) socketed axehead.","fourFigureLat":"52.61114642","fourFigureLon":"-0.95288697","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Megan Gard","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Megan Gard","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Billesdon","county":"Leicestershire","district":"Harborough","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/EB5D97.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"26.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
