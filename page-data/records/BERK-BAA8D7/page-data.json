The cutting edge has a pronounced crescentic form with the tips re-curving back onto the expanding form of the blade body. The body has a well-defined stop ridge just short of midway down its length and the flanges extend and taper, down to the blade section. There are clear casting lines down each side of the axe, there are no other design elements to be seen.  There is a loop to one side at the juncture between blade and septum.  The palstave has an incomplete well-developed shiny blue-green coloured patina.\n\n\n\nThe palstave measures 160.0mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 50.6mm wide from blade tip to blade tip, and 36.6mm thick across the stops.
