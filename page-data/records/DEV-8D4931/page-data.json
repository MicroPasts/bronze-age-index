All four internal surfaces are intact and in good condition. On the upper and lower surface there is a raised casting flash, following a seam along the length of the object. On all four sides a raised pattern of three lines wraps around the object, taking up the space between the end and the small, shallow handle. The internal space is a condensed circle measuring 7.1mm in diameter, while the handle surface itself is tapered, from a narrow triangle at the proximal end to a wide flare at the distal end. The object itself narrows from 30.5mm to 21.8mm in width, before flaring sharply to a small, neat blade that measures 27.8mm across and is 3.1mm thick at the cutting edge. The blade is a convex curve.\n\n\n\nThe surface is covered with a mid-green patina with large areas of a darker corrosion. There is one patch where this darker corrosion has caused deeper damage to the metal, approximately 3/4 of the way down the shaft, where there is also a sharper linear nick in the surface.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples include SOM-AE4024, the record for which records that Taunton-Hademarschen axes were previously thought to date to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800BC) but the finding of an example on the Isle of Wight in a hoard of Taunton phase palstaves (Treasure Annual Reoprt 2003, p. 197), confirming the Middle Bronze Age date and distribution suggesting a date of 1400 to 1150 BC. These characteristically long thin axes are relatively rare but other examples are known from Somerset including from Norton Fitzwarren (see Needham et al, Archaeological Journal 154, 1997, 87, fig 18,5 and the corroded example from Norton Fitzwarren Needham, Somerset Archaeology & Natural History 133, 1989, 37-8, fig 17,11). There are also examples from Wiltshire recorded on the database (WILT-C4C954).","fourFigureLat":"50.64839446","fourFigureLon":"-3.30264451","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"A number of examples of this type of axehead have been found associated with watery contexts suggesting structured deposition, however this example notably comes from a coastal area within 500m of a cliff edge.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"October 10, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Otterton","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV8D4931.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"121.55"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
