There is a highly pronounced rib running up the centre of the fragment on either side illustration the continuation of the socket, forming a central square-sectioned profile with the wings to either side as well. The overall condition of the artefact is worn, corroded, and in a poor condition. Very little of the original patina remains, which is dark green in colour. The end of the tip is very narrow and pointed. The irregular break at is an old one.\n\n\n\nTwo similar examples displaying the slender blade are illustrated in Watson's 'Catalogue of british and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', 1993, BAR British Series 233, page 21, ref nos 245-6, found in Spain (no exact provenance) and page 25, ref no 324, found in Neuchatel, Switzerland.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"November 03, 2004","datefound2":"November 03, 2004","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Shropshire","district":"Telford and Wrekin","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-37F438.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"46.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
