The object is formed of a flat circular section with a irregularly shaped lump projecting from one side. As the pattina suggests much of the lump is unbroken, there is no obvious form of object that would be shaped in such a way. The most likely answer would be a cauldron lug, though the object does not curve enough. \n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 43.28 mm; width: 53.32 mm; thickness: 24.73 mm; weight: 117.13g.","fourFigureLat":"51.56845754","fourFigureLon":"0.29276095","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"B.
