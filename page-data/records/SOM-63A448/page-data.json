The fragment is broadly rectangular in plan. The butt end, part of the flanges, part of the blade and the cutting edge are missing due to old breaks. The flanges taper to form a worn U-shaped septum. It exhibits a worn stop-ridge approximately halfway along its length. The blade expands out slightly along its length before terminating in a worn break approximately mid-way along the length of the blade. In profile the palstave is lentoid, with the widest section at the stop-ridge. It exhibits traces of a vertical casting seam along one side, however, due to the worn condition, it is not possible to state the full extent of the casting seams or any decoration.There is a green and brown patina on the surface.\n\n\n\nThe palstave measures 57mm in length, 27.8mm in width, 20.4mm in thickness and weighs 103.92g.","fourFigureLat":"51.20389432","fourFigureLon":"-3.47571652","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"\nThis record is from a finds day and therefore may not be to usual PAS standard.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Denise Wilding","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.4","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Minehead","county":"Somerset","district":"West Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/denisewilding1/IMG_0301.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
