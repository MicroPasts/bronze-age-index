The chisel measures 52 mm in length, 19 mm in width and 14 mm in thickness at the collar. Only 8 mm of the length of the tang remains which is square in section, 6 mm x 6 mm, above a transverse spheroid collar which is circular in plan, 14 mm in diameter and 10 mm in height, which separates the tang from the flattened blade, which is triangular in plan and in profile, and expands in width from 10 mm, below the collar, to 19 mm at the broken edge and narrows in thickness from 9 mm below the collar to 3 mm at the broken edge. There is some active bronze disease on the edges of the blade and on the surface of the collar which also has vertical cracks equidistant around the circumference of the collar.\n\n\n\nSavory (1980) illustrates a similar tanged chisel with a spheroid collar, supposedly found in a hoard in 1850, but since discovered that they were not associated, with a socketed gouge and a Hallstatt B sword from Brogyntyn, Selattyn near Oswestry in Shropshire, on p.123, fig.44, no.288.3, which is dated from the Late Bronze Age (c.1050-800 BC). \n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar complete tanged chisel from Kingston in Dorset on p.614, pl.53, no.416a which was found in association with a sword dating from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age. \n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar complete tanged chisel found in a hoard associated with Ewart Park phase swords in Gussage St. Michael, Dorset, on p.82, pl.9, no.250b.\n\n\n\nFor similar examples recorded on the database see: DEV-C3AD9B; DOR-F18347; DUR-5BADA1; IOW-2182C4; IOW-376E53; KENT-77798C; NMS-5059F9; SUR-101EF6; WILT-5D7742.","fourFigureLat":"50.07535579","fourFigureLon":"-5.69115386","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"December 04, 2019","datefound2":"December 04, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"14","edge":null,"thickness":"14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sennen","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN8449.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
