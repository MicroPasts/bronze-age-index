The entire surface is heavily pitted with corrosion. A broad date has been proposed as the appearance of the object most closely resembles Early Bronze Age flat axeheads of the Migdale type (e.g. HAMP-3781B6 and DEV-8D7466), but its small size is comparable to late Iron Age and Roman miniature votive deposits (e.g. SUSS-9DD02B). \n\n\n\nLength: 49.5mm, width: 25.81mm, thickness: 3.87mm, weight: 20.25g. \n\n\n\nCf.
