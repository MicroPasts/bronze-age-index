It is missing its tang above its collar. It measures 43.26x28.31x10.47mm and weighs 24.93g.\n\nThe collar is sub-rectangular in cross-section (11.28x10.36mm) with rounded corners and c.5mm high. To one side projects a very worn stump, the remains of the tang, measuring 6.96x6.15mm. Below is an oval-sectioned neck, expanding from 7.68x6.19mm to 9.01x6.04mm, where it extends into an expanding bell-shaped chisel-end. The nearest (top) edge of this is curved, as in the curved top of a bell, and is slightly thicker than the neck above (6.40mm max.thickness). This narrows to 1.37mm thick at the cutting edge. In shape, the sides curve gently outwards then inwards, with the cutting edge itself flaring outwards again at the very end. The actual edge has a slight curve though is mostly straight.\n\nThe object has a smooth blue-green patina with some light surface scratches. Its bell-shaped chisel-end is very similar to WILT-846EE0 from Cricklade, North Wiltshire.","fourFigureLat":"50.97618978","fourFigureLon":"-1.13251423","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"June 30, 2012","datefound2":"July 30, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.47","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Corhampton and Meonstoke","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-3CDA23.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"43.26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
