The axe has very slight low flanges on both faces. There is a casting ridge along each side. The axe thins and flares out into a broad cutting edge which is slightly bevelled on both faces. It thins and tapers in the other direction to a rounded butt. The body of the axe is slightly thicker to at the centre than it is at the ends. The surface of the axe has several patches of light green corrosion and damage to the cutting edge, sides and butt. The rest of the surface has a smooth, dark green patina. This flanged example is characteristic of the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage (Kevin Leahy, pers. comm).
