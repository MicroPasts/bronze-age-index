The fragment is curving in profile and would have originally been c.23mm in diameter. It measures 17.4x13.6x1.7mm and weighs 2.04g.\n\nThe fragment is decorated to the outwardly curving side only, with two bands of a pair of grooved lines.\n\nTo the reverse the metal is not smooth, possibly through corrosion.\n\nThe two longer edges are jagged and are clear breaks. However the two shorter edges both seem to be original, which would suggest the object is no a spearhead. Possibly, patination has ocurred over the break, as is visible on part of the more jagged edge.\n\nThe orangey-dark brown colour of the metal and the decoration suggest a Middle/ Late Bronze date. If not a spear head this is possibly some kind of decorative ring, although I can find no parallels.","fourFigureLat":"51.689402","fourFigureLon":"-1.712075","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"March 31, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lechlade","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Cotswold","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Belk0608spear.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"17.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
