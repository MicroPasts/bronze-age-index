It measures 46.42x29.36x(max)14.45mm and weighs 51.2g.\n\n\nThe cutting edge is expanded but has edge loss through corrosion. The casting flash is visible, smoothed down, on one side. There are traces of possible iron staining or corrosion in the socket and on both faces near the break. Where the patina survives it is smooth and orangey-brown. However it is missing in large patches, revealing a bright green colour beneath.\n\n\nThe socket is rectangular in cross-section, and the fragment itself triangular in cross-section.","fourFigureLat":"51.25793467","fourFigureLon":"-2.23066938","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"October 26, 2011","datefound2":"January 26, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.45","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dilton Marsh","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/WILT-475A23.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"46.42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
