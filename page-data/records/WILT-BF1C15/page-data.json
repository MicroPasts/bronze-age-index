There is  damage to one half of the socket opening and to one of the side-loops.  One of the wings is slightly bent and the tip of the spear is missing.  The breaks do not appear to be old. The blade is 'flame shaped' and what  remains of it is 37.20mm long (it would have been c.64.35mm). The  widest part of the blade is 19.70mm. The mid-rib of the blade is an  extension of the socket and extends to the broken tip of the spear. At  the base of the blade this mid-rib is 9.55mm thick. From the opening to  the base of the blade the socket is 43.50 in length and tapers in  diameter from 15.15mm to 9.45mm. The thickness of the metal is 2.35mm.  There are two side-loops on opposite sides of the socket, about half way  between the base of the blade and the socket opening, on the same axes  as the wings of the blade. Only one is intact and the perforation is not  visible due to corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.70773378","fourFigureLon":"-1.97245555","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alastair Willis","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alastair Willis","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cirencester","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Cotswold","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILT-BF1C15.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"81.35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
