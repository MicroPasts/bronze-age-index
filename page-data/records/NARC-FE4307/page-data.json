If this identification is correct, only part of the tip of the blade remains. The fragment tapers at quite an acute angle from 9.99 mm to 1.2 mm thick. The acute angle would seem a little strange for an axehead so this raises some doubt about this identification. An alternative possibility is that it is part of the side of a spearhead. Aside from damage where the object has broken, the blade is also worn and is jagged through corrosion. At one end the object appears to have been cast with a slight groove, and an then has an angle of 135 degrees before the blade begins. The blade then curves around gradually to the break. As the object is so fragmentary it is hard to distinguish how these features related to its function, but it is possible that they represent the base of a spearhead, and the tang is missing although this is very tentative.  There is no evidence for it having had a socket. The object measures 36.41 mm in length and 27.14 mm wide. It is 10.25 mm thick and weighs 21.6 grams. It has a pale green patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.741215","fourFigureLon":"-2.312491","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"December 06, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.25","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gnosall","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-FE4307.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"36.41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
