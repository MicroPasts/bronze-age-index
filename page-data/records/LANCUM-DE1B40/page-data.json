The axe has a broad head, tapering to a narrow butt. There is no evidence of flanges or ridges along the sides of either face but it is heavily corroded. This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe appears to be undecorated. The length is 77mm, width 37mm, thickness 10mm, and the weight 25.54g.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being \"notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.
