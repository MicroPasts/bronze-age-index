The chisel has a tapering rectangular-sectioned tang (50.17mm long), which abuts the collared handle stop. The oval collar measures 12.55 mm x 9.65mm. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in cross-section and flares in width to a thin, crescentic cutting edge 31.08 mm wide. The blade sides are slightly concave. The cutting edge is 27.5 mm wide. The object is in very good condition and has a dark brown patina across much of its surface.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: length: 82.39 mm; width of tang: 8.85 mm to 3.50mm; thickness of tang: 6.95mm to 2.05mm and weight: 27.28g.\n\n\n\nTanged chisels, which date from c. 1000-800 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds; complete examples from such contexts are uncommon. They are one of the more commonly found woodworking or leatherworking tools alongside awls and knives (Boughton 2021:66). Other recorded examples include: BERK-4008DB; IOW-C0BF8E; and  IOW-8EDC79.","fourFigureLat":"50.82870559","fourFigureLon":"-0.73767642","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Clark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Clark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.65","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Oving","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS64CC9C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"82.39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
