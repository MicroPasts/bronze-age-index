It measures 30.45x18.20x(max)7.24mm and weighs 11.46g.\n\n\nThe cutting edge is expanded and worn but apparently undamaged. Both faces are pitted and the shorter looks 'caved in' at the edge - conducive with a hammer blow. All breaks are old.\n\n\nThe socket is rectangular in cross-section, and the fragment itself triangular in cross-section.\n\n\nWhile the axehead is rather small, it is difficult to say whether or not it is 'votive'. It may have just had a use as a small axehead. However the probable hammer blow could well be ritualistic - although it could equally represent the scrapping of metal, the hoards of which are so prevalent during the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC).\n\n\nBen Roberts (British Museum) comments that although the form of the blade is different, it is similar to Miniature axeheads, which have a concentration in Wiltshire, and are datable from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period.","fourFigureLat":"51.410936","fourFigureLon":"-1.857607","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"November 29, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.24","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Avebury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Glastonbury1110axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"30.45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
