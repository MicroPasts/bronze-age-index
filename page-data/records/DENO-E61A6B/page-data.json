In plan it is broadly triangular with straight sides tapering to a rounded, but now abraded point. It is very flat in cross section. The hilt end is badly damaged with the outer corners and the central tang all broken. The break has occurred across the three circular rivet holes, approximately 8.5mm in diameter, one on each corner, and the other in the centre of the tang. This one is positioned slightly further down into the hilt than those on the outer corners. These positions suggest that the tang was slightly convex in shape. One of the side rivets remains in situ, with the other two found loose nearby.\n\n\n\nThe rivets are circular in cross section with expanded convex heads at either end, and vary in length from 14.4mm - 14.9mm, and in width from 9.8mm - 10.5mm. The weight of the two detached rivets, 5.60g and 5.15g.\n\n\n\nDagger, Length 125.0mm, Width 57.6mm, Thickness 1.8mm, Weight 62.28g.\n\n\n\nThe overall condition of the piece is fairly stable, with little sign of active corrosion. General patination of both surfaces normal for this type of metal, some areas of delamination.\n\n\n\nRef. Rohl.B, and Needham.
