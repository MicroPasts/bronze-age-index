This spearhead has a probable narrow leaf shaped blade (top half missing) with a lozenge shaped middle and flat side flanges section. The shaft is circular in section and socketed. To either side of the shaft, halfway along its length, is a lozenge or leaf shaped knop or probable side loop, both of which are slightly flattened against the shaft. There is no peg hole on the shaft. The casting seams are visible down the length of the shaft. The original surface is mostly intact and has a mid brown, orange patina. The object has suffered damage in a variety of forms. The surface is pitted and scratched, and the blade is broken half way and there is a large semi-circular nick at the mouth of the socket. These signs of damage are worn smooth and evenly patinated suggesting that they occurred in antiquity. It measures 121.24mm x 27.82mm x 18.76mm, weighing 82.35g.","fourFigureLat":"53.471222","fourFigureLon":"-0.660655","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Ward","datefound1":"January 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Scotton","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 881 arrowhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Service","length":"121.24"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
