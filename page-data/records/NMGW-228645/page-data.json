The spearhead is fragmentary, missing the basal end of the blade and base of the socket with only the top end with tip surviving. The spearhead has broken through the central socket, which is solid, with a diameter of 14.2mm x 12mm). The position of the socket is marked by a prominent, rounded midrib with a width of 12.1 at the break, height of 3.3mm on one side and 4.3 on the other, and maximum surrounding overall depth of 12.2 just before the break. The midrib tapers gradually towards the tip (0.7mm in width and 3.2mm overall depth at the point). Faint lines run parallel to the midrib from the break and appear to terminate c.7.6mm from the point, though they could have run up to the tip and have since been eroded away from surface damage. The surviving blade edges suggest the blade end is triangular in plan and widens just before the break (39.3mm), so was possibly leaf-shaped. The spearhead is slightly bent towards the break (as seen in section) suggesting the object was intentionally bent and broken prior to deposition. One side of the spear has been struck, possibly by plough, with a diagonal groove running from the midrib to the edge of the blade. \n\n\n\nThe absence of the socket makes typological identification uncertain. The more commonly–recovered types consistent with the form of the fragmentary spearhead are pegged, of Davis’ generic Group 11 (2015)[1], or possibly of a side-looped type, Davis’ (ibid) Group 6. Socketed Spearheads of Davis’ Generic Group 11 can be dated to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated by Needham et al (1996)[2] to c. 1200 – 900BC.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is an uneven grey patina with patches of bright green, dark grey/black possible tenorite, and orangey brown. The object has a max length of 85.3mm, width of 39.3mm, thickness 14.2mm and weighs 48.72g.\n\nSimilar spearheads are recorded on the PAS database e.g. NMGW-215EBE, YORYM-E5C837, YORYM-3D457F, NMGW-3EA2A8, SOM-4FBE8D","fourFigureLat":"51.93483857","fourFigureLon":"-3.25230093","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adelle Bricking","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adelle Bricking","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llangors","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/202177new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"85.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
