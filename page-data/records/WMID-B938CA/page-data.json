The septum is straight and does not taper towards the butt. The flanges start off parallel to the stop ridge and taper in a straight diagonal line to the butt. The blade has straight sides as it expands towards a crescentic blade edge. The blade is longer than the butt. A shield design (trident variation) is present at the top of the blade, with one central ridge and two inward curving lines starting at the stop right and curving inwards to the central line. The line continues below the shield shape. A slight crack, as a casting flaw is present below the stop ridge on the blade facet. The top of the blade facet is straight across the blade. Slight traces of the casting seam are visible along both sides of the butt. No loop or knick are present.\n\n\n\nMeasurements:\n\nOverall Length: 159 mm\n\nMaximum Width: 59.0 mm\n\nMaximum thickness: 35.5 mm\n\nSeptum Length: 68.9 mm\n\nButt width: 19.8 mm\n\nButt thickness: 5.3 mm\n\nFlange Height: 12.1 mm\n\nStop ridge height: 12.1 mm\n\nBlade length: 90.1 mm\n\nBlade width (stop ridge): 25.0 mm\n\nBlade width (edge): 59.0 mm\n\nBlade thickness: 3.3 mm\n\nWeight: 458.5 g\n\n\n\nThe palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. \n\n\n\nThis palstave fits within the Group 3 Palstave types, consistent with dating between c. 1400 to C. 1150 cal BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.78333784","fourFigureLon":"-2.87619967","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"35.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Little Ness","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMIDB938CA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"159"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
