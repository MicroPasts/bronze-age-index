The main body and part of the wings survive, but the tip and the attachments on the socket are missing. The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade and the socket and midrib are circular in section. There is no visible decoration and the edges are damaged, obscuring any edge bevels. The metal has a smooth grey green patina, but is deeply pitted in places. The edge of the blade is smooth and curved, suggesting there was no change in angle in the edge of the blade. The spear is 88.3mm long, 45.7mm wide, 21.5mm thick and 92.5g. The socket at the widest end is 21.5mm thick and 17.3mm wide. The midrib at the break at the tip end is 18.5mm thick and 15mm wide. The maximum surviving width of the blade (from midrib to edge is 17.1mm and it is 7mm thick maximum.\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic end of the socket and in particular the way it was attached to the shaft is unclear from this fragment, meaning it cannot be categorised exactly, but it was either looped or pegged. It is is probably a leaf shaped socketed spear head with a circular midrib section, indicating it is a Middle Bronze Age side-looped or basal-looped example or a Late Bronze Age pegged example. These date from the Acton Park to Ewart Park phases, about 1500-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"54.04392102","fourFigureLon":"-1.49753781","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"February 21, 2016","datefound2":"February 21, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brearton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2874_BA_Spear_Fragment.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"88.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
