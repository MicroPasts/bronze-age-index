The butt is near-straight. (22.3mm wide and 5mm thick). The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the stop and is comparatively slender (at 25.0mm wide and 25.4mm wide at the stop). The sides are not nicked below the stop but are concave and divergent to produce a moderately expanded blade edge but has lost one of the blade tips (with a surviving width of 59.7mm) and has also lost the original blade edge. There was no loop and the casting seams are evident on both sides and have ben finished, probably by hammering. The flanges begin below the butt (approximately 13mm) and are now truncated but are straight, gradually rising towards the stop (where the axe has a maximum thickness of 22.1mm) but do not continue onto the blade. The septum has a slight concavity across its width and has a consistent thickness. The stop has a gentle curve and is slightly undercut (with a height above the septum of 8.2mm and 6mm above the blade). Below the stop on the blade is a shallow shield-shaped depression (21mm long), characteristic of the palstave type. The blade is convex across both its width and length. There is the suggestion of two weak blade facets and discernible hammer marks are present on the lower part of the blade. Sharpening striations are evident running off the blade edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with more recent surface damage and loss with a bright green corrosion. The surface has been treated by the finder, possibly altering the patina colour.","fourFigureLat":"53.18240621","fourFigureLon":"-3.43799704","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"The axe is an early example of the palstave form and it has been argued (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pp. 125) that North-East Wales and the Marches was the source of this form of axe type.\n\n\n\n1.
