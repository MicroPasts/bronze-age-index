The fragment comprises the extreme tip and is relatively well preserved. The piece is sub-triangular in plan with a distinctive bi-convex profile. The break is old and patinated but the artefact is relatively unabraded. The cutting edges are slightly rolled and the central rib extends to the tip making a strong puncturing point. The surface patina is a brown colour with a well formed surface longitudinal patinated scratches are present on either edge suggesting that the spear had been used and sharpened. A direct parallel or narrower date cannot be suggested due to the fragmentary nature of the artefact.\n\n\n\nThe spear tip measures 41.2mm length, is 12.8mm wide at the break and 6.2mm tick.
