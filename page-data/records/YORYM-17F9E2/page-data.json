The remaining portion of the spearhead is triangular in plan with a pointed ovate section. Pronounced midribs are present on both faces of the spear expanding from the pointed tip to a lozenge terminal end. The blade extends to either side of the midrib terminating in abraded edges.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a light blackish-green patina and is worn. The spearhead is 60.35mm long, 26.93mm wide, 11.82mm thick and weighs 28g.\n\n\n\nThis fragment is likely to be the lower portion of YORYM-9976A6 which is from the same location. That portion of the spearhead has basal loops indicative of spearheads of the Taunton and Penard phases, 1400 – 1125 BC (Davis, 2017); the type corresponds with Davis Group 8.","fourFigureLat":"54.08920436","fourFigureLon":"-0.47264845","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Rania Zein-Elabdin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Rania Zein-Elabdin","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.82","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Langtoft","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/WS0335.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"60.35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
