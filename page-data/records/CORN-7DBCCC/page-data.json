The side loop is 29 mm long and has an aperture that is 9 mm in diameter. The casting seam above the loop as been chiselled away, but there is still a raised lozenge-shaped lump, and the rest of the seam on both sides has been chiselled flat. The stop is 18 mm wide and 10 mm deep on both sides and the thickness of the flanges together, front and back, is 30 mm so the start of the blade beyond the stop is about 10 mm thick. The blade is 21 mm wide below the stop and expands into a crescent which is 63 mm wide and 2 mm thick at the cutting edge. The mid rib is 7 mm wide and 62 mm long, and is accentuated by two parallel grooves, one on either side of the rib, that are 5 mm wide and 62 mm long. There are multiple oblique scratches above the stop and between the flanges on one side, which have probably been caused by scraping old varnish or lacquer off the surface with something metallic, since its recovery and re-sale. Other than these, there are very few marks on the axe and little corrosion, and the blade is only damaged slightly at either corner, which has not happened through use, but more likely since deposition. Mid-ribbed palstaves with crescentic blades and side-loops can be found during the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1275 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age, with broad crescentic cutting edges with tips at right angles to the blade, but the narrow body and low flanges rising to the stop ridge of this palstave are indicative of a transitional type which could date from the following Penard metalwork phase (c.1275-1125 BC) (Matt Knight pers comm).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar palstave with a side loop, a broad mid-rib and a crescentic blade from Barskeoch Moss in plate 61, no.832, which is classified as a Type Carleton, Variant Kirkcowan, low-flanged, side-looped, mid-ribbed palstave and compared to items produced during the Ornament Horizon of the later Middle Bronze Age such as a palstave in the Taunton hoard (c.1400-1275 BC).","fourFigureLat":"53.23309192","fourFigureLon":"-1.16250295","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"May 31, 1980","datefound2":"May 31, 1989","subsequentActionTerm":"In a private collection, recorded for academic use","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Centred on village (which isn't a parish)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Cuckney","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Bassetlaw","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June16finds187.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"153"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
