The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge and the socket is sub-rectangular in cross section. The axe measures 99.6mm length, 45.8mm in width at the blade, 35.8mm at the socket, it is 33.7mm thick and weighs 174.25 grams. The depth of the socket is 65.3mm.\n\n\n\nThe socket of the axe is sub-rectangular with patinated breaks around three sides which have removed the original end of the socket. The remaining complete section has a single swollen moulded collar up to 8.6mm wide. Only the inner stub of the loop survives the middle is missing to an old break and the other end has been lost with the mouth suggesting it was on or adjacent to the collar.\n\n\n\nThe two long sides of the axe are plain and expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been hammered. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is complete but has a corroded surface so it is not clear if it was prepared for use or suffered use damage.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion.\n\n\n\nIn general socketed axes are rarer in Somerset than palstaves. The axe appears similar to Savory (1980) no. 200 and 281-9. from Llanberis and Llantwich Major. It is probably of Type A1 and dates to the Ewart Park phase, 1000-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.03717907","fourFigureLon":"-3.09957665","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"33.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cheddon Fitzpaine","county":"Somerset","district":"Taunton Deane","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elburnett/SOM079C7A.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"99.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
