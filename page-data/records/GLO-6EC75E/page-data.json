The axe is sub-triangular in plan with a wide rounded butt that is 24mm wide, the sides expand out evenly in a gradual concave arch to the cutting edge which is 48mm wide, the blade is slightly convex in shape. The blade bevel is slight and when viewed to the side the axe has a low lentoid profile. \n\n\n\nThe axe has suffered from corrosion that has recovered the original patina and left a pitted surface. \n\n\n\nThe axs fits with some of the earliest metal artefacts found in Britain, possibly associated with the Migdale Metalworking tradition. This would date it as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to. These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.","fourFigureLat":"51.45339309","fourFigureLon":"-2.77853564","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"January 01, 2022","datefound2":"May 31, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clapton-in-Gordano","county":"North Somerset","district":"North Somerset","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO6EC75E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"73"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
