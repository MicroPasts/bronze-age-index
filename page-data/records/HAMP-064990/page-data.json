One face and two sides of the axehead retain much of the original shiny, smooth olive green-brown soloured patina. Elsewhere, where the patina is lost, the metal is rough, heavily pitted, and a blueish-green in colour. \n\nThe blade is triangular in shape, the long edges a little in-curved and the cutting edge expanded (51.2mm wide). Visible on the face retaining its original patina, the cutting edge is bevelled and above this are shallow hammer markings/ workings. There is a little damage to one end of the cutting edge.\n\nThe stop ridge measures 24.2mm wide and 32.3mm in depth. Below this, and continuing as a line from the flange edges above, a rib on either side converges in a point at the top of the blade to give a triangular shield-shape. Just below the stop ridge, the top of the blade is waisted and measures 22.5mm wide and 24.5mm thick.\n\nAbove the stop ridge the flange edges running along the butt end of the axe slope upwards to a point c. one third of the way along the butt end before sloping downwards again for another third of the length where the flange becomes level with the butt end. At their highest point, the flanges have a depth of 36.9mm; however only one of these points survives undamaged so it is likley the original depth was c.38mm. Originally, the flanges would have had a distinctive lozengiform shape. To one side of the axehead these are badly damaged and motly missing (old damage). The butt end is 19.4mm wide and 6.6mm thick. One corner is missing (old damage).\n\nTo the sides of the axehead the casting flashes are visible in places, worn smooth. To one side, a pair of longitudinal grooves are visible just below the butt end. It is uncertain whether these are decorative or the remant of a worn casting flash.\n\nThe length from the butt end to the stop ridge is c.61mm. It is max.14.1mm deep (behind the stop-ridge - there is also a deepish hole at this point, a possible casting flaw) and 15.8mm wide inside the flanges behind the stop.\n\nThe axehead measures 145.1mm in length, max. 51.2mm wide (cutting edge) and 36.9mm thick (stop ridge). It weighs 384g (to the nearest 2g).\n\n\n\nGroup I types are of Acton Park 1 metalworking industry corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 4 and probably dated to c. 1600 - 1450BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.10926697","fourFigureLon":"-0.91575418","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1450","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"April 28, 2018","datefound2":"April 28, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"36.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Worldham","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP064990.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"145.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
