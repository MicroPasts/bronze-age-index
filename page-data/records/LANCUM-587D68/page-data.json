The fragment is sub-rectangular, rectanuglar in cross-section. The cutting-edge is angular and narrow. The blade shows signs of breakage and damage. The sides of the axe are triangular, tapering towards the cutting-edge. The break is uneven on both faces and the lower portion of the socket is visible at the break, consisting of a narrow, sub-triangular hollow.The length is 36mm, the width is 35mm, thickness 16mm and the weight 40.52g. Similar examples of this can be seen in records KENT-ECBAFE, WMID-6D041B and HAMP-4A5FB6. Due to the size and condition of the fragment it is difficult to confidently assign a Type of socketed axe.","fourFigureLat":"52.74847712","fourFigureLon":"1.00625961","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Emily Woolnough","datefound1":"November 03, 2014","datefound2":"November 03, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Foxley","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM587D68.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
