The sides are heavily-corroded and pitted but there is the suggestion of a casting seam evident on both sides. The faces are largely flat, before converging to the blade edge with a discernible blade facet (7mm from the blade edge). There is a slight bend across the length of the blade, suggesting the axe was bent prior to breaking. The corroded and pitted surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright-green surface loss. \n\n\n\nThe small and corroded blade fragment is difficult to identify in relation to typological features. The form is perhaps best paralleled with Early Bronze Age flat axes or Developed axe types and the narrow straight sided form and with a blade facet is suggestive of Developed types. The diminutive size may suggest an ‘axe-chisel’.  Flat and Developed axe types are associated with Metalworking Assemblages II – VI, corresponding with Needham’s (1996)[1] later Period 2 –to Period 4 but Developed types are of Periods 3-4, c. 2000 – 1500BC\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age, Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140","fourFigureLat":"51.853785","fourFigureLon":"-4.8183294","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"New Moat","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017811new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
