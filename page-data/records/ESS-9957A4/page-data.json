This fragment represents the back end of a palstave axe and appears to have broken from the axe at the point of the backstop. The fragment is subtriangular in plan and section with a wedge shaped profile in that it narrows towards its back edge. To either side are clear flanges set at 90 degrees to the main body of the object. The original surface of the axe is missing and it is now abraded and pocked. It has a mid green patina with spots of brighter green corrosion. The break edge, though worn, is very regular, suggesting the axe had been deliberately broken, possibly for its inclusion in a scrap hoard. It is 29.1mm long, 25.74mm wide, 8.26mm thick at the widest point. The flanges are 12.06mm high. The fragment weighs 33.43g. Axes of this type date to from the middle to late Bronze Age c.1275-1140BC.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1275","todate":"-1140","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.26","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Berden","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/DSCN1930.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"29.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
