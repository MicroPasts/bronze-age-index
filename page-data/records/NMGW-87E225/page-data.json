Down the centre of the blade is a straight midrib. This is wide and angular in cross-section, at the top end tapering with a straight line into the haft-plate. The blade edges have been entirely removed, thus also removing any traces of bevelling originally along the edge. Whilst much of this damage is due to erosion of fragile edges, it is possible that some edges were notched through use wear or mutilation prior to burial. The erosion seems particularly deep and severe, with concave eroded depressions side by side, creating a 'nibbled' effect in places along the blade edge, almost as if notches were later prone to differentially high erosion. The blade end is blunt. The haft-plate is also heavily eroded, though is angular rather than rounded in shape. The halberd reveals evidence of four rivet holes, positioned as two lateral pairs on the haft-plate (rather than being arranged in an arc along it). The lower two are complete, whilst the upper two are visible only as partial grooves along the line of the eroded hilt-plate edges. The whole blade has been bent, as viewed in side section, probably in antiquity, there being no evidence of modern impact. The blade remains sturdy, yet is pitted across its surfaces. The overall patination is green, yet the eroded pits have a light green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.670273","fourFigureLon":"-4.966024","fromdate":"-2400","todate":"-2000","notes":"Halberds have recently been reassessed by Needham (2015) and a new typology presented for the British series. This halberd was published within Needham's paper (Cat.No.20) and falls within Type Pistill Dewy, which is characterised by four rivets in a trapezoidal formation following the hilt (Needham 2015, Appendix S1, p.23). Only four or five examples are currently known from Britain and this style may be linked with French influence.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"January 01, 1995","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by a museum - not a Treasure case","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.5","discoveryContext":"Unknown","parish":"Hundleton","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/Halberd.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Wales","length":"284"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
