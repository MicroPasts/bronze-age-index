The axe is complete with an overall length of 136.4mm and has a weight of 380.3g. The butt is slightly convex and has a width of 24.5. The sides are straight and parallel as far as the blade. The axe may be seen as comparatively slender with a width of 27mm. The flanges are of sub-lozenge form and are highest near the start of the blade (45mm from the butt), with a height of 27.0mm. The flanges are convex and faceted across their height. The interior of the flanges are convex, making the septum narrowest at the point where the flanges are highest. There is no stop on the septum and the axe has a convex (lenticular) profile across its length. The blade face has a weak central bevel and no blade facet is discernible. The sides of the blade expand moderately and turn-out at the tips to produce a curved blade with a width of 57.3mm. The axe has areas of very good surface preservation with a dark green patina, in other areas the surface is pitted with azurite and pale green corrosion products.","fourFigureLat":"51.412366","fourFigureLon":"-3.338625","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 86) note that Type Kirtomy are difficult to date because of their comparatively plain form.
