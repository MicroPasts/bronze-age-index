The cutting edge has a crescentic form with slightly flared tips. The edge is missing portions of side due to post-depositional processes. There is a stopridge a little under halfway down the palstave. The stopridge is flush with the flange. The integral loop is centred just before the stopridge. There is a beak at the apex of the loop resulting in the loss of a small portion and the break is abraded. The flange ends at the stopridge resulting in a shield shape. Portions of the outer edges of both flange are missing due to post-depositional processes. The flanges and septum form an H shape. There is a slight central raised mid-rib, extending from the stopridge to the cutting end on both sides. The object retains casting seams around the upper and lower edges. The butt edge is irregular in plan. The metal has a dark greenish brown, slightly pitted patina.  \n\n\n\nLate/transitional palstave possibly of the Wilburton/Penard Phase.\n\n\n\n2 An incomplete copper alloy Palstave The object is a slender palstave. The cutting edge has a crescentic form with slightly flared tips. The edge is missing portions of side due to post-depositional processes. There is a stopridge a little under halfway down the palstave. The stopridge is flush with the flange. The integral loop is centred just before the stopridge. The flange ends at the stopridge resulting in a shield shape. Portions of the outer edges of both flange are missing due to post-depositional processes. The flanges and septum form a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges. There is a pronounced central raised mid-rib, extending from the stopridge to the cutting end on both sides, which expands and becomes more shallow towards the cutting edge. There is a semi-circular void in the centre of the butt end. The object retains casting seams around the upper and lower edges. The metal has a dark green, slightly pitted patina. \n\n\n\nLate/transitional palstave possibly of the Wilburton/Penard Phase.\n\n\n\n3 A fragment of a copper alloy Flat Axehead. The retained portion is the cutting edge of a flat axehead, it is solid cast and the object flares out to the sides towards the butt end creating a wedge shape. The sides of the cutting edge are flared and the cutting edge tapers in to form a bevelled cutting edge. There is a casting seam visible on the upper and lower edges. The object terminates in a transverse break resulting in the loss of approximately 60% of the original form.  \n\n\n\n4 A fragment of a copper alloy Blade, Dagger or Rapier. The object is rectangular in plan and ovate in cross section. It is incomplete being broken transversely on the upper and lower edges. There is visible bevelling along the left and right hand edges away from the mid-ribs. The central portion of the blade retains two longitudinal mid-ribs. The metal a dark green predominantly smooth patina.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: It is not possible to assign the more fragmentary pieces (noâ€™s 3-4) to a particular typological grouping due to their fragmentary nature, however they fit within similar groups of middle to late Bronze Age hoards using those diagnostic features which are retained. The more complete objects (1-2) fit within the Wilburton/Penard Phase of Late/transitional middle Bronze Age date. \n\n\n\nDimensions: \n\n\n\n1 Length: 169.27mm, Width: 43.89mm, Thickness: 34.91mm, Weight: 600g\n\n\n\n2 Length: 141.65mm, Width: 42.80mm, Thickness: 30.53mm, Weight: 368.9g\n\n\n\n3 Length: 34.60mm, Width: 71.88mm, Thickness: 14.78mm, Weight: 124.0g\n\n\n\n4 Length: 28.87mm, Width: 27.34mm, Thickness: 3.25mm, Weight: 17.7g","fourFigureLat":"52.01960385","fourFigureLon":"-1.18534655","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-800","notes":"The objects were found is close proximity and are associated, they are of prehistoric date and consequently qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"4","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hinton-in-the-Hedges","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARCE9B3071.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
