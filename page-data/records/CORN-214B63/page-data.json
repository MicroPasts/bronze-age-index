The collar is quite substantial at about 12 mm deep and 9 mm thick, and there is quite a deep indented area below it before the body of the axe begins with a raised ridge. Along this ridge at one side of the axe is the remains of the base of the side loop, which has worn into a point. The surface is pitted and some of the original patina remains on the collar but the projecting sections have become worn and corroded and there are patches of light green bronze disease. There is not enough detail to precisely date this fragment within the Late Bronze Age, but some comparanda are offered below.\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar 'South-Eastern' socketed axes from St Goran, Cornwall on page 566, Plate 5, No.58, and from Totnes, Devon on page 602, Plate 41, No.308, which are dated from the Ewart Park period c.900-800 BC.\n\n\nNeedham and Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar 'South-Eastern' socketed axe with a circular socket, thick collar and a raised ridge on page 136, Fig.38, No.334, which is dated from the Ewart Park phase also.","fourFigureLat":"50.075356","fourFigureLon":"-5.691154","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"February 02, 2011","datefound2":"February 02, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sennen","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Feb12finz 006.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
