The sides, when looking at the face of the chisel, are slightly concave along the length, curving outwards towards the blade. The chisel is a light to dark green colour and heavily corroded and pitted. The blade has a curved edge which is worn, and fragments of the edge have been broken off in the past, but it appears to mainly follow the original edge with no flaring of the tips. There are scars on both faces that are probably the result of plough damage. The hollow interior is cone-shaped, with the socket ending 20 mm up from the blade. The cross-section of the chisel is sub-rectangular with the walls ranging from 2.5 mm to 2.8 mm in thickness. The chisel is missing its butt end and was probably about 70-80 mm in length originally. The shape and curve of the blade suggest that this might have been a tool for carving wood, with the rounded edge enabling the carver to work with a concave area. The angle of the bevel, at about 20Â°, would have made it ideal for fine work where thin slivers of wood were being removed. Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar example on page 132, No.175, which is dated to the Penard period, c.1300-1150 BC. Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar but complete example from Cottonwood, Bodmin, on page 401, Plate 2, No.12, which is dated to the Taunton-Penard phase c.1400-1200 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.070736","fourFigureLon":"-5.551014","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"July 19, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Paul","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/mixfinds 016.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"56"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
