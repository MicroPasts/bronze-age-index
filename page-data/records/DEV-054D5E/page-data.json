It is now 40.9mm wide at the blade. From this wide point, the blade tapers and becomes more slender and rectilinear, with a marked raised central rib on both faces. This rib is damaged, but the scar indicating its presence is visible where the raised rib itself is missing. It measures 8.2mm wide, and is 60.4mm in length. This rib joins the thickened stop, which is rounded in cross section, akin to two plano-convex shapes adhered to one another at the central point. The stop is 24.2mm wide, and 28.5mm thick. The septum, which is 53.4mm in length, continues to taper from the stop, with the channel between its two raised sides markedly rounded in appearance, with a rounded end where it joins the stop. One of these sides is badly damaged and almost missing. However, when viewed from the side, these two sides create a triangular shape which tapers to its narrowest angle at the butt. The butt is damaged. Possible casting lines are visible, suggesting the palstave may have been unfinished when it was deposited. \n\n\n\nMatt Knight has commented on a similar example: \"Palstaves of this type are typically found across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, as well as further eastwards in Dorset and Wiltshire. One particularly comparable example is a single find from Ashburton, Devon (Pearce 1983, 432-3, No.184, pl.23), though examples with varying decorations are also present in several hoards from Somerset (e.g. Sherford, Taunton Union Workhouse and Edington Burtle).\"\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 154.8mm length, 40.9mm width, 28.9mm thickness, weight 359g.","fourFigureLat":"50.59243443","fourFigureLon":"-3.47063698","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"October 01, 2019","datefound2":"January 07, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dawlish","county":"Devon","district":"Teignbridge","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV054D5E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"154.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
