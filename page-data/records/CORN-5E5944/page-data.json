The fragment is broken just above the stop ridge which would have stopped the wooden haft on both sides, and is missing its blade so it is difficult to classify, but from the shape and the side loop it likely dates from the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age. The broken edge is rectangular in section with the bases of the worn flanges, 4 mm in height, on both sides of the palstave and the butt is narrow and parallel-sided blade between these flanges in plan. The flanges taper as they move towards the butt end where they are flush with the surface. The blade would have expanded slightly below the missing stop ridge and terminated in a crescentic blade edge. The remains of half of the side loop project outwards 9 mm from the surface of one side of the palstave and the loop is 15 mm long. The surface of the blade is damaged and pitted but some smooth layers of mid-green patina have developed and there are patches of light green bronze disease.\n\n\n\nIf the stop ridge was squared off, perpendicular to the parallel-sided low flanges, then this butt end was probably part of a side-looped Transitional Type palstave, but we do not know if the blade was plain or decorated.\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar palstaves with low side flanges, parallel sides and squared-off stop ridges from Yorkshire and Denwick in Northumberland in plates 62 & 64, nos.859 & 880, which are classified as Transitional Palstaves and dated from the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a palstave with a side loop and a squared-off stop ridge from Christchurch, Dorset on p.93, pl.20, no.228, which is dated from the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.56708904","fourFigureLon":"-4.83965934","fromdate":"-1275","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"March 25, 2018","datefound2":"March 25, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Endellion","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN6981.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"44"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
