At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket of sub-rectangular form (28.8mm x 5.2mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 7.6mm), broken in antiquity. The socket is wedge-shaped, converging towards its base. A small length of the sides survive (19mm), which appear slightly bevelled towards a central ridge, which comprises the neatly finished casting seams. The surviving sides are straight and slightly divergent to the blade tips (with a surviving blade edge width of 39.2mm). The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded but is irregular with a slight curved edge (with a surviving depth of 5mm). The surviving blade faces are slightly convex across both their lengths and widths. There are no ribs evident on the surviving faces. The surface has a partially preserved dark-green patina and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.","fourFigureLat":"52.03724838","fourFigureLon":"-2.86153356","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Madley","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2018121axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"30.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
