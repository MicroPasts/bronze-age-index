This fragment represents one of the side faces of the axe. It is sub-rectangular and is flat but curved in section. One side of the single mouth moulding is intact. Beneath this moulding there is a groove. The fragment also holds the complete side loop, set at 90 degrees to the main body. A casting seam is visible along the fragment but is less clear over the loop. The object is abraded. Patches of original surface survive on the outer face with an orangey brown patina. Exposed surfaces are lighter and bright green. The inner original surface survives in better condition with an even mid green patina. The break edges are worn, suggesting damage occurred in antiquity. The fragment is 37.1mm long, 27.38mm wide, 3.18mm thick and weighs 21.69g. The side loop is 19.76mm long and 10.66mm wide.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sible Hedingham","county":"Essex","district":"Braintree","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/DSCN2982.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"37.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
