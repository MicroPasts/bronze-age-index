The rest is presumed, lost in antiquity. The dagger fragment is sub rectangular in plan. The dagger has a sub lentoid cross section. The remains of one rivet hole is present at the top, the other is missing. The blade tapers towards the edges. None of the edges are original, all have been damaged. Neither side of the blade exhibits decoration.\n\n\nThe blade measures 64.32 mm in length, 35.70 mm wide and 2.95 mm thick. It weighs 28.9 g.\n\n\nThe blade is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface patina, leaving areas of a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion from occurring. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box, such as a tupperware box, with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue paper and silica gel.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"Comment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): I think this is the hilt and upper blade of a trapizodal hilted rapier of middle BA date. The remains of one rivet hole can be seen on the upper edge of the hilt - and the upper part is  a clear trapezoid tapering in width and expanding in section at the junction with the upper blade - which seems slightly stepped - although abrasion hasn't been kind - the blade looks lentoid in section and the upper plate has a flatter section.\n\n\nFrom the profile I think it looks most like a Grp III rapier or more likely  a dirk (shorter rapier - under 30cm / 1ft in length)- see http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/109896 and http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/rapiers-and-dirks\n\n\nThey are a tricky group to separate but fit within a broad later MBA tradition - 1400 - 1250 BC which fits with a Taunton / Penard assemblage - Needham period 5 Burgess metalwork stage VIII - IX.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.95","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Burntwood","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-D54E37.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"64.32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
