The object is similar to solid flat axes with a tapering blade, resembling a miniature version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads. The sides are slightly curved and the blades cutting edge has suffered heavy corrosion. \n\n\n\nThe object has a heavily pitted patina.\n\n\n\nThe broad date range has been given due to the form of the object most closely resembling early Bronze age axe heads, however there are numerous examples of Roman votive deposition of such minature axe heads.","fourFigureLat":"54.16856101","fourFigureLon":"-1.26626827","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Miss Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.33","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Thormanby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ellie/YORYM-CE8933.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"59.01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
