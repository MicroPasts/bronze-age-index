The surviving fragment, comprising the butt and part of the haft end, is sub-trapezoidal in shape and slightly concave at the point the flanges begin to expand and the haft increases in thickness towards the break. The surfaces have a mottled mid and dark green patina, as well as several small patches of old lamination that have a light-green patina. The fragment measures 21.2mm in length, 21mm in width and 2.2mm thick at the butt, 28.2mm wide and a maximum of 8.8mm thick at the flanges, and weighs 15.56 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.95399647","fourFigureLon":"-0.15333146","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Harvey Cross","datefound1":"October 31, 2018","datefound2":"October 31, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weston","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"North Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH16E417.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"21.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
