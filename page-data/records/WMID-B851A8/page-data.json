The artefact seems to have broken off have way down the blade, and a side section illustrates the blade wings to be slightly unlevel either side and the hollow socket visible. The mid rib continues down to the tip of the blade. The spearhead is worn and in a poor condition with greater corrosion along the cutting edge, with some bronze disase in areas.\n\n\n\nA similar example is illustrated in Watson's 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', 1993, page 25, ref no 324, which is described as a 'pegged socketed spearhead with long slender leaf shaped blade; central rib down both faces formed by continuation of socket. Blow holes in rib and near top of socket'.
