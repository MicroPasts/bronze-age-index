The rest is missing, presumed lost in antiquity,\n\n\n\nThe mouth may have originally been square in shape, as the fragment exhibits an almost right angle bend. The mouth has a rolled rim. The start of two ribs are present on the body.\n\n\n\nIt measures 21.3 mm in length, 28.2 mm wide and 6.5 mm thick (at the mouth), 3.4 mm thick (body). It weighs 11.6 g.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead fragment is mostly a dark green colour, with the odd light green patch. These lighter areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occuring, which exhibitis as a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the fragment should be stored in a sealed airtight dry box (such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal), with plenty of silica gel.\n\n\n\nToo little is present of this socketed axehead to determine what type it was, but it is definitely of Late Bronze Age dating (c. 950 BC to c. 750 BC).","fourFigureLat":"52.54297762","fourFigureLon":"-1.54432979","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"October 21, 2016","datefound2":"October 21, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hartshill","county":"Warwickshire","district":"North Warwickshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID9C4EAC.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"21.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
