The butt is narrow (with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 3mm) and was moderately straight. The sides are straight as far as the midpoint, below which they are concave and expand to the eroded blade tips (with a surviving blade width of 56.0mm). The original blade edge has been lost and is moderately curved. The sides are comparatively flat across their thickness with no surviving evidence for any flanges on either face. One face has a clear median bevel (with a thickness of 9.8mm, positioned 58mm from the blade edge, where the axe has a width of 29mm). There is the suggestion of a blade facet discernible (8mm from the edge). The other face has suffered more surface corrosion and does not convincingly display a median bevel or blade facet. The better preserved face has remnant traces of a pale-grey to dark-brown patina, elsewhere the surface is heavily-pitted pale-green to dark-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe axehead has a discernible median bevel on one face, suggesting some developed features on the axe. It is possible that hammered flanges were present but do not now survive.","fourFigureLat":"52.99107821","fourFigureLon":"-2.73142244","fromdate":"-1950","todate":"-1750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Agden","county":"Cheshire West and Chester","district":"Cheshire West and Chester","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2014.8.1jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"112.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
