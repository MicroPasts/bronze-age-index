Although the patination (darker green with little or no corrosion) and breaks of objects Nos. 1 - 3 are very similar, they do not re-fit.\n\n\n\n1. A fragment from the mouth of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe head with a shallow and not well defined moulding at the rim and broken across a second shallow moulding. The breaks are irregular and unabraded but not recent. Now separate, but within socket of another axe (No. 4) when found. It has not been possible to assign the axe to a typological grouping.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length: 15mm; Surviving width: 18mm; Weight: 6.4g.\n\n\n\n2. A fragment of cast, curved copper alloy Late Bronze Age socketed axe head with no original edge, the breaks irregular and unabraded but not recent. Now separate, but within socket of axe 4 when found. It has not been possible to assign the axe to a typological grouping.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 15mm by 18mm; Weight 4.1g.\n\n\n\n3. A fragment from the mouth of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe head with a shallow moulding at the rim and broken across a second shallow moulding. The breaks are irregular and unabraded but not recent. Now separate, but within socket of axe 4 when found. It has not been possible to assign the axe to a typological grouping.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length: 15mm; Surviving width: 21mm; Weight: 6.2g.\n\n\n\n4. An incomplete Late Bronze Age socketed axe head, broken and distorted. The sides originally straight or very slightly concave but now distorted, with an oval-sectioned loop, and narrow but distinct casting seams on each edge. The mouth and blade are missing, the breaks irregular and slightly corroded, with both faces apparently hammered at either end to pinch the broken edges towards each other. The surface is mostly patinated mid green, with patches of very pale dusty green corrosion. Object Nos. 1 - 3 were found within the socket of this axe head.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 63 mm. Surviving width at break at blade end: 33mm. Maximum surviving thickness: 22mm.\n\n\n\n5. A fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe head consisting of the curved blade only, broken across the base of the socket. The surface is corroded dull pale green with very worn breaks. It is not possible to be certain because of the condition of the breaks, but it seems unlikely that fragment Nos. 4 & 5 are parts of the same object.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length 24mm. Width of cutting edge 38mm. Weight 23.5g.\n\n\n\n6. A fragment of an unidentified object. Sub-rectangular, flat-sectioned and thickened at one end. The edges and surface are extremely worn making it uncertain if the edges are broken or original except at the thinner, short edge which is probably a break. Perhaps part of a blade.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 35mm. Width 22.5mm. Maximum thickness 7mm. Weight 19.6g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThe small area from which these objects were recovered and the presence of fragments within the socket of axe head No. 4 clearly suggests that these objects were deposited together as a hoard of prehistoric metalwork. The finds appear to represent a hoard of Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800/700 cal BC) metal in a fragmentary condition, often referred to as a 'founders' hoard'. It is not been possible to assign the axes to more particular typological grouping because of their fragmentary condition but it may be possible to do so in the course of future study.","fourFigureLat":"52.63064311","fourFigureLon":"1.04251108","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Conclusions\n\n\n\nThe objects (No. 1-6) represent a single find of prehistoric base metal. The find therefore qualifies as belonging to a grouping of at least two prehistoric base-metal objects and, therefore, as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Erica Darch","datefound1":"March 01, 2014","datefound2":"March 30, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Erica Darch","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"6","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Runhall","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edarch/59739_7517F1_BA_Hoard_1and4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
