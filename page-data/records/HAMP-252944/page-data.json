The incomplete spear head is lozenge shaped, with bevelled edges and a pronounced central ridge running down both faces. The tip and edges of the spearhead are extremely worn. There is a worn break across the spearhead, with none of the socket remaining. The spearhead has a sub-lozenge cross section, which suggests it is part of side looped socketed spearhead of middle Bronze Age date. The surface of the metal has some pitting and it has a patchy mid to dark green patina. The fragment is 41.99mm long, with a maximum width of 8.06mm, a minimum width of 2.79mm, and a maximum thickness of 4.72mm, minimum thickness of 1.87mm.","fourFigureLat":"51.077137","fourFigureLon":"-1.473221","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura McLean","datefound1":"November 28, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Laura McLean","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.72","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kings Somborne","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lmclean/HAMP-252944 Spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"41.99"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
