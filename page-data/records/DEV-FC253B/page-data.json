The fragment is most likely to derive from a socketed axe. It is difficult to make a more precise classification due to the shape of the remaining fragment, however, it has been suggested that it is more likely to be a Late Bronze Age socketed axe due to the position of the break along the body and the shape of the blade. The axehead is broadly trapezoidal in plan and triangular in profile. The fragment consists of a small portion of the blade and part of the socket. The blade tips are intact, however, the cutting edge has been removed by a series of old breaks. The blade narrows along its length away from the cutting edge and terminates in an old break. The casting seams appear to be trimmed and finished. The axehead has a dark brown and green patina.","fourFigureLat":"50.40159139","fourFigureLon":"-3.61950766","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Dawn Shoemark","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.78","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stoke Gabriel","county":"Devon","district":"South Hams","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jshoemark4/DEVFC253B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.31"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
