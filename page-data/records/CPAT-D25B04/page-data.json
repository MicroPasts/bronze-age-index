There is a single mid-rib on either face of length c.45mm which fades out c.30mm before the curved cutting edge. The blade-tips have rounded corners with no recurve. The septum is quite small (length=36mm, min. width=13mm, max.=22mm) with very slight flanges (max. height=2mm). The stop ridge is straight and one side is slightly higher than the other (width at stop-ridge=22mm). There are also traces of a casting-scar on one side. The colour of the palstave is a range of greens and browns, the surface is pitted with only a couple of small patches of the original surface surviving, one at the blade edge retains a patina and striations possibly indicative of sharpening or polishing.  It is an early palstave of the Acton Park or Taunton phase. Similar examples are one (of uncertain association) from the Acton Park Hoard itself (Lynch, Aldhouse-Green and Davies, 2000, pp104-5) and one from St Fagans, Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, pp169, no. 153).","fourFigureLat":"53.123556","fourFigureLon":"-3.047486","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jeff Spencer","datefound1":"November 22, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jeff Spencer","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hope","county":"Flintshire","district":"Flintshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jspencer/2456-0002.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"110"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
