It still retains a sharp cutting edge. The patina is a fairly even light brown and there does not appear to be any invasive corrosion. It has broken unevenly before the main body of the axe. Its size and shape suggest it is from the early or mid-Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"53.334791","fourFigureLon":"-2.166647","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Frances McIntosh","datefound1":"February 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frances McIntosh","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Stockport","district":"Stockport","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fmcintosh/axe head.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"31"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
