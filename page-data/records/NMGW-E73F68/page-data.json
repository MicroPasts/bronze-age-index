The butt (29.2mm wide and 3.2mm thick) is damaged, possibly from the casting but appears to have ben straight. The sides are straight and broadly parallel as far as the stop (31.6mm wide at the stop). Below the stop (10mm), the sides are prominently nicked (32.8mm wide), below which the sides are concave and divergent to a slightly recurved blade edge (71.5mm wide). The flanges begin at the butt and are straight and divergent, reaching an apex above the stop (with a maximum depth of 39.4mm, 16mm above the stop. The flanges return to the blade below the stop, at the position of the side nicks. The flanges are convex across their depths and appear to have been comparatively elaborate, with an outer border parallel to the flanges (8mm wide) and defining a central lozenge (70mm x 15mm). The septum is comparatively flat and straight (9mm thick, 20mm wide and 33mm long). The stops have a slight curve and are raised above the blade faces (with a height above the septum of 5mm and 9mm and above the blade of 5mm and 3mm). Below the stop is a weak shield device (34mm long) defined by a slightly raised platform, rather than mouldings. Below the shield the blade is flat across its length and very gently convex across its width. There are clear hammered blade facets (beginning 20mm from the blade edge with a lower facet 11mm from the edge). The blade edge has some damage and it is now difficult to identify any contemporary nicks or wear. A small number of sharpening striations are now discernible running along the blade edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina and has suffered from some flaking but has been treated by the finder, possibly altering the patina colour.\n\n\n\nThe axe is an early example of the palstave form and it has been argued (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pp. 125) that North-East Wales and the Marches was the source of this form of axe type.\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
