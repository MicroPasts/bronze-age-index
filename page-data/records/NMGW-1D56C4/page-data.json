The flat-topped mouth is sub-oval (56.8mm x 50.3mm) with a sub oval socket (36.9mm x 32.4mm and with a maximum depth, containing sediment of 41mm). Three of the four casting runner stubs are evident on the face but have been carefully removed. The mouth moulding has a prominent lip on most of one face but the other face has the usual bevelled-steeped moulding. The sub-circular loop (with a length of 37mm) springs from the moulding on one side and has broken just above the moulding. Both breaks on the loop appear to be recent. The sides have a gentle concavity long their lengths and are bevelled to the centre across their thicknesses. The casting seams are clearly discernible but have been neatly finished. The sides diverge to the gently expanded blade edge (with a width of 58.0mm), which has a very gently curvature. The original blade edge has been lost. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, which descend from the moulding and continue for most of the faces (with a length of 66mm). Additionally the edges of the faces are raised, suggesting further ribs. The faces are otherwise gently convex across their widths and near straight across their length, before converging more sharply at the blade, below the ribs but with no blade facet. Hammer facets are discernible on both blades. The surface has a dark-green patina and traces of probable tenorite survive on the upper part of the faces and along the length of both sides. \n\n\n\nThere are crude incised marks on both blades, lying beneath the patina and seemingly deliberate, the marks generally extend from the ribs, including the sides and end before the blade edge. There are addition incised marks running across the blades crossing the verticals. Some of the marks are doubled in areas, suggesting a secondary attempt on the same alignment and implying a deliberate design was attempted. A number of sharpening striations are also evident running both along and perpendicular to the blade edge.","fourFigureLat":"51.74188522","fourFigureLon":"-2.65313695","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Briavels","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Forest of Dean","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017110new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"107.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
