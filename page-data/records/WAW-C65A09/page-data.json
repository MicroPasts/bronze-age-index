The copper alloy spearhead is almost complete with the edges of the blade being abraded and the rim of the socket is damaged recently. The blade is a slender leaf-shape and the edges of the blade are slightly bevelled. The midrib tapers towards the tip, which is missing and expands to the socket. The socket is still filled with soil, and is 17.36mm diameter on the interior and 22.03mm diameter on the exterior. The socket is decorated with three bands of triple stranded grooves. On the exterior edges of the outer grooves there is a very fine low-relief zig-zag design. The socket also has a circular perforation on one side, the perforation on the other side is not visible due to corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the spearhead has a well-developed shiny dark brown patina.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 129.77mm in length, 22.03mm diameter at the socket, 27.44mm wide across the blade and weighs 74.45g with soil.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a pegged spearhead which date to the late Bronze Age (c. 1150-600 BC) and are usually found in the Thames Valley, Cambridge Fens and east Midlands.\n\n\n\nThis spearhead type can be attributed to Davis (2016: 2) Group 11, where he states that Group 11 'represents 72% of the corpus. Attributes are peg holes in the socket and various blade forms e.g. an even curve from blade/socket junction to the tip; a wide curving blade base with blade edges then leading straight to the tip. Overall spearhead length varies considerably from c.100mm to c.400mm. Several have incised decoration on the socket.'\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nDavis, R.
