In profile the fragment is triangular with the dark green matte broken edge forming the thick part of the fragment. The upper and lower surface of the fragment has a shiny dark green patina which has feint marks of probable hammering. The fragment measures 25.01mm wide, 16.69mm wide, 6.72mm thick and weighs 8.15g.\n\n\n\nThe hammering and surface condition suggests a possible Bronze Age date. The wedge shaped profile to the fragment suggests it may be the butt of a palstave or an axe. The fragment is probably dated to the middle Bronze Age (c. -1500 to c. -950).","fourFigureLat":"52.05762809","fourFigureLon":"-1.57845151","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"June 03, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.72","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brailes","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWE8E391.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"25.01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
