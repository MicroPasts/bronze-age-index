The cutting edge has a pronounced crescentic form with the tips re-curving back onto the expanding form of the blade body. The body has a well-defined stop ridge just short of midway down its length and the flanges extend and taper, down to the blade section. There are clear casting lines down each side of the axe, there are no other design elements to be seen.\n\n\n\nThe blade appears to have been lightly used with a few small indentations and modest striations over its surface. However, it can't be ruled out that the markings are from its time and movement in the ground. The surface looks to have been 'treated' in some way with the resultant loss of the original patination - the finder reports that this palstave was found during works on a medieval moated site in the 1980s, and appears to have come from the dredge of the moat. This may explain the surface appearance of the axe. This palstave is unusual in the inclusion of flange extensions on the side of the blade but without a central midrib. Rowlands (1976: plate 26, nos. 252, 189, 238) illustrates three similar examples which he define as his type 2 (side flanged) form dating to c. 1500-1150 cal BC. There are no good parallels illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) although the form most closely corresponds to their Group 2 (early Mid ribbed) due to the flange extensions. They suggest this form is one of the earlier tpyes dating to the Acton Park to Taunton Phase of the bronze Age c.1500-1250 cal BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.66742567","fourFigureLon":"-0.98924246","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rod Trevaskus","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"29.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lewknor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BERK41E4C6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"70.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
