Carp's Tongue sword blade fragment\n\n\n\nSurviving length 41.0mm; surviving width 27.7mm; maximum thickness 9.5mm; surviving weight 35.2g.\n\n\n\nSmall blade fragment with a rounded midrib, approximately 11.8mm wide, with edge defined by single grooves to either side and on both faces. The outer sections of the blade are highly corroded, with no original blade edge surviving. The blade fragment is bent towards one end, as viewed side on, indicating it was forcibly broken in antiquity. The fragment has a green patination, with areas of ligher green corrosion along breaks. Cracking is visible on both sides, parallel with the midrib and near the corroded edges.\n\n\n\n2. Carp's Tongue sword blade fragment\n\n\n\nSurviving length 27.7mm; surviving width 28.6mm; maximum thickness 7.2mm; surviving weight 19.6g.\n\n\n\nSmall blade fragment with a rounded midrib, approximately 11.0mm wide, with edge defined by single grooves on either side of both faces. On one side of the blade, short sections of original blade edge are present, the outer blade section being slightly convex. On each outer blade section, a second, less pronounced groove also parallel with the blade edge is evident, approximately 4.2mm from the midrib edge grooves and 5.0mm from the blade edge (the total outer blade section being approximately 9.2mm wide). The surviving blade edge looks to have been deliberately damaged by a blade in antiquity, as evidenced by nicks and localised distortion of the blade edge. On one face, just below a break, there are impact dints on the midrib, causing localised flattening of the blade and an undulating surface. These are small and non-linear, suggesting the use of a pointed metal implement. This is further evidence of deliberate breakage of the blade in antiquity. The fragment has a green patination, with areas of lighter green corrosion along the least well preserved blade edge, in localised patches at blade breaks and in the blade edge nicks on the better preserved blade edge. Corrosion cracking is visible on the surface of the less well preserved outer blade side.\n\n\n\n3. Purse- or bag-shaped chape fragment\n\n\n\nSurviving width 47.1mm; surviving height 27.8mm; surviving weight 21.3g.\n\n\n\nBase and body fragment of a chape with a curved convex base, defined by a convex ridge or bead on each face, and hollow interior. The walls of this chape thicken towards the base. On one side, a change in angle of the wall is visible, indicating a narrowing inwards towards the original mouth of the chape, now missing, thereby giving its characteristic 'purse' or 'bag' shape. At the break on the best preserved face, the partial circuit of a perforation, 2-2.5mm in diameter, is evident. This is offset from the centre line of the chape and was a point of attachment of the chape to the rest of the scabbard. No further perforations may be identified in the walls of this fragmentary chape. On one face, near the narrowing side wall, a surface dent can be seen. This was appears to have been made in antiquity and is possibly evidence of use wear or deliberate damage prior to burial. The artefact has a green patination with localised areas of light green corrosion on one face and along the line of breaks.\n\n\n\n4. Multiple-edged perforated blade\n\n\n\nLength 77.1mm; surviving width 42.7mm; maximum thickness at centre 8.0mm; surviving weight 88.0g.\n\n\n\nA near complete, elongate hexagon shaped blade. The blade has a thickened elongate ridge along its longitudinal axis, tapering off on all sides, to form blade bevels and sharpened edges on all six sides. The blade has a rectangular shaped perforation at the centre and parallel with the long axis. The top of the aperture on each face is significantly larger than the actual perforation through the object. The apertures on each face, although overlapping, are also offset in relation to each other (on the long axis) and different in size. On each face, looking into the aperture, both an area of perforation and an area obscured by bronze from the centre to the lower face is evident. At one narrow end, a fragment of the blade bevel and edge has been broken off. The blade has a green patina. Original blade edges survive on one long side and one of the shorter end faces, the others being damaged and corroded with swelling light green corrosion product.\n\n\n\n5. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment\n\n\n\nMaximum surviving length 42.5mm; maximum surviving width 33.9mm; maximum thickness 20.8mm; surviving weight 122.1g.\n\n\n\nIrregular upper surface and irregular convex shaped base. No edge sections apparent, although ingot fragment tapers on one side, where approaching an edge. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to blue-green patina.\n\n\n\n6. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment\n\n\n\nMaximum surviving length 73.5mm; maximum surviving width 57.1mm; maximum thickness 30.7mm; surviving weight 367.6g.\n\n\n\nIrregular upper surface and irregular convex base. Breaks on two faces and tapering in two planes indicates this is a corner fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Large interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n7. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment\n\n\n\nMaximum surviving length 63.7mm; maximum surviving width 48.7mm; maximum thickness 34.6mm; surviving weight 462.4g.\n\n\n\nIrregular upper surface and slightly convex shaped base. Breaks on all four sides indicate a middle fragment of an ingot although tapering in two planes indicate the fragment was approaching two sides of the ingot. Large interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n8. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment\n\n\n\nMaximum surviving length 56.0mm; maximum surviving width 49.8mm; maximum thickness 27.0mm; surviving weight 299.0g.\n\n\n\nIrregular upper surface and slightly convex shaped base. Breaks on three sides and tapering in one plane indicate that this is a side fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n9. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment\n\n\n\nMaximum surviving length 75.0mm; maximum surviving width 63.8mm; maximum thickness 31.0mm; surviving weight 577.9g.\n\n\n\nIrregular upper surface with vesicles and irregular convex shaped base. Three breaks and tapering in three planes suggest this is an incomplete end fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Interior vesicles are evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Light grey-green to grey-green patina.\n\n\n\n10. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment\n\n\n\nMaximum surviving length 87.0mm; maximum surviving width 60.3mm; maximum thickness 36.2mm; surviving weight 618.5g.\n\n\n\nIrregular upper surface with vesicles and irregular convex shaped base with vesicles. Three major breaks and tapering in one plane indicate this is a side fragment of a plano-convex ingot. There is a small break along the edge, although short sections of original ingot edge are present. Breaks and vesicle edges have some angularity however lack of freshly exposed surfaces suggest breakage in antiquity. Light grey-green patina.","fourFigureLat":"51.73523117","fourFigureLon":"-5.23102237","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"The classes and types of artefacts identified within this dispersed artefact scatter find close parallel within Late Bronze Age hoards elsewhere, with the combination of associated types indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating certainly to between 1000-800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997) and probably between 900-800 BC (Brandherm & Moskal-del Hoyo 2014, 33). This is consistent with their once having been buried at the same time and in direct association with each other in the ground, probably in a small purpose made shallow pit feature. It is probable that the original hoard burial place was disturbed though recent agricultural ploughing or boundary wall modification activity nearby. The scatter pattern, over a maximum distance of 22.5 metres, is entirely consistent with these likely scenarios, dispersal of objects being commonly observed during the recovery of hoards. It is possible that further artefacts from the hoard may be found in the immediate locality at future date and these would also be considered as potential treasure, in association with these earlier finds.\n\n\n\nThe two sword blade fragments in this hoard (nos. 1 & 2 above) may be identified as of Carp's Tongue form on the basis of their rounded midribs defined by single grooves following the outline of the blade (Colquhoun & Burgess 1988, 108; Needham 1990, 52). The chape fragment (no. 3 above), of diminutive size, with a convex base defined by a bead, sides narrowing towards the mouth and a perforation for attachment to the rest of the scabbard, may be identified as one of a class of bag-shaped or purse-shaped chapes, also termed Class 3 chapes (Eogan 1965, 169-74, Fig. 92 Nos. 11-14; Burgess 1968, 22-3, 38-39; Figs 13-14 & Appendix V; O'Connor 1980, 190-1). The multiple-edged and perforated blade (no. 4 above) can be identified as a knife, with variant forms termed racloirs and hog's-back knives (O'Connor 1980, 179). Racloirs are triangular in shape with three blade edges and a central perforation, while hog's back knives are sub-rectangular, have a single blade edge and a perforation set at the top margin opposing the blade edge. While preliminary research has not yielded close parallels for the Marloes & St Brides example, with its elongate hexagon shape, central perforation and four blade edges, nevertheless the combination of similar features and form permit confident identification as a knife allied with these known classes of knives.\n\n\n\nPlano-convex ingot fragments (nos. 5-10 above) become common components of hoards towards the end of the Late Bronze Age. Over 40 Carp's Tongue hoards of Ewart Park date, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex copper alloy ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). Similarly, the St Ishmael, Carmarthenshire hoard contained a single plano-convex ingot fragment amongst a hoard of fifteen artefacts (Gwilt et al, unpublished treasure report).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Gwilt","datefound1":"January 09, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"10","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Marloes and St. Brides","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/DH007014_08.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museum Wales","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
