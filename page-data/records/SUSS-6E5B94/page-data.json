A fragment of a cast copper alloy Bronze Age palstave. The section comes from the butt-end/hafted-end of the axe but does not include the butt itself. There are several breaks and patches of corrosion with only two sides presenting the original patina. A casting seam is visible on one side of the fragment.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: Height: 25mm; Width: 17.5mm; Thickness (max.) 12.3mm; 8.49 mm (min.); Weight: 43.2g\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nA previous discovery of three objects from the same findspot was made in May 2006 and was declared Treasure (Treasure case 2006 T272). The objects from that hoard (an unlooped palstave and two palstave fragments) are consistent with the character of object No. 1. Given that the fragment was found at the same location it can be considered (on the balance of probabilities) to be an addendum to 2006 T272. The fragment is too small to be typologically diagnostic but, if accepted as an addendum to 2006 T272, it may be assigned to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC), specifically the Acton Park phase of c.1500-1400 BC based on the typo-chronology of the unlooped palstave from the earlier find.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThis object represents an addendum to Treasure Case 2006 T272 and therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002) by virtue of being part of a find of two or more base metal objects of prehistoric date from the same findspot.","fourFigureLat":"50.84418717","fourFigureLon":"-0.52419768","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"Addendum to 2006 T272\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\nNeil Wilkin, Curator, The British Museum\n\n\n\nFebruary 2015","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"April 30, 2014","datefound2":"June 25, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Stephanie Smith","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Warningcamp","county":"West Sussex","district":"Arun","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2014T708a.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The British Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
