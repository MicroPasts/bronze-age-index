It is not possible to determine if the object is complete or cut down though the latter is likely. The front surface of the sheet is decorated by a series of sub-parallel indented grooves running along its length.\n\n\n\nDimensions:\n\n\n\nLength: 10.4mm; Width: 9.6mm; Thickness: 0.3mm; Weight: 0.4g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\n\nSimilar objects have been recorded as 2019 T316 (LEIC-47D0C2), 2018 T650 (HAMP-F792A5), 2010 T664 (LVPL-83FE92) and 2013 T471 (WMID-3CBCF0). The latter record states that similar multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48).\n\n\n\n2017 T882 (SOM-62CE08) states that several similar pieces have also been found bent into cylindrical beads and it is unclear if this was their original purpose or if this was a common reuse for parts of larger ribbon ornaments.\n\n\n\nConclusion: \n\n\n\nIn terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","fourFigureLat":"53.76302021","fourFigureLon":"-1.10648841","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brayton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Selby","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/2019T274.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"10.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
