This spearhead fits into the final phases of the Late Bronze Age specifically that associated with the Taunton/Wilburton - Ewart Park industrial phase, circa 1200 - 800 BC. Davis (2017) dates this type, 'generic' pegged, Davis Group 11, to the Late Bronze Age, 1100 â€“ 800 BC.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead comprises a leaf shaped blade with a chamfered edge and two circular peg holes on both sides of the socket which are positioned in the upper portion in line with the blade. The socket is conical extending into a raised oval sectioned mid-rib that extends to the tip. The blade is leaf shaped having a maximum width in the lower 1/3 of the blade. The blade is not heavily eroded and the blade facet is present in the upper blade as a clearly visible chamfered edge. The tip of the blade is slightly bent and a small crack is present.\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\n\nLength of socket: 200mm\n\n\n\nInternal diameter of socket: 24.3mm\n\n\n\nExternal diameter of socket: 27.9mm\n\n\n\nDepth of socket: 121.7mm\n\n\n\nDiameter of peg wholes: 4.6mm & 3mm\n\n\n\nLength of blade: 152.8mm\n\n\n\nMaximum width of blade: 41.3\n\n\n\nWeight: 141.61g\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill (FLO, Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments that it is interesting to note the rich dark patina on one face and abrasion corrosion on the upper which suggests that it was placed below the plough soil or at the junction between the natural and the plough zone. The tip is deliberately bent - most likely in antiquity as there doesn't seem to be loss of patina on the bend - which there would be if it were more recent. This is common on spearheads from ritual areas.","fourFigureLat":"54.21336197","fourFigureLon":"-0.34538649","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gristhorpe","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Scarborough","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/MRB0002.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
