Both faces have a median ridge (some are cast with a ridge only on one side and are flat on the other side), this broadens out to a tang with a sub-rectangular section, both lateral edges are bevelled to sharpen the edges.\n\n\n\nThis example is part of a growing corpus of copper-alloy Bronze Age arrowheads from the UK, see PAS records: ESS-A41D75 WILT-8171F0  WILT-807272 SF-4014B0 SF-C931F4 SUR-4655A8 SWYOR-3A2CF7, another on the database is LIN-D95544  is certainly a razor, not and arrowhead, cf.

Another theory was that these could have come from abroad but no parallel has been noted from the continent of this distinct form, though there are variations on the barbed and tanged type.\n\n\n\nOnly one has come from a datable context, from the Penard hoard, type site for the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age: \n\n\n\nPENARD, GOWER, SWANSEA (SS 56 89)\n\n\n\nFound in 1827 by a quarryman at Llangrove, Pennard.
