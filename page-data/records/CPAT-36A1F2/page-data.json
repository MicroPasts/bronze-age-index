The axehead is wedge shaped with an oval socket. There are three raised ribs to both sides, running down from the mouth moulding and extending half of the way down the face, towards the cutting edge. The socket has a clear rectangular shape at its base formed by the mould. The axehead has a fixing loop to one side, just below the Mouth moulding. The cutting edge has a pronounced flare to each blade tip. The axehead shows signs of use with chipping to the cutting edge and there is a small piece of one blade tip area missing. The overall patina is of a dark bronze colouration with evidence of a fine surface finish remaining on one side. The axe is well cast and has a black surface finish noted between the ribs, this finish is thought to have been deliberately applied. The axe head has the style of the Breidden Hill group of axes which in turn, fits within the Ewart Park phase c 800-700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.855354","fourFigureLon":"-2.862799","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jeff Spencer","datefound1":"August 28, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rod Trevaskus","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"36","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cockshutt","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2456-0036r.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust","length":"115"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
