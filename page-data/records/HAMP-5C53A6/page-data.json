The fragment consists of the cutting edge in full and part of the blade defined by roughly straight cut, possibly deliberate. From the blade (W.: 21.4mm) the axe flares to a maximum width of 34.75mm.  At the break the fragment is solid, suggesting that it did not come from a socketed axehead; there is no obvious casting seam.  The whole is pitted and corroded with a dark green patina and areas of lighter bronze disease.","fourFigureLat":"51.076154","fourFigureLon":"-1.287666","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1200","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"May 19, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.35","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Itchen Valley","county":"Hampshire","district":"Winchester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-5C53A6axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
