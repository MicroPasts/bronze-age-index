The blade tapers towards either edge. The edges to the top and bottom are old, pre depostional breaks. The remains of a circular rivet hole are present on the top edge. No decoration is present on either the front or back of the blade.\n\n\n\nIt measures 63.5 mm in length, has a maximum width of 19.3 mm and a minimum of 13.4 mm. It is 3.1 mm thick in the centre of the blade and 1.2 mm thick along the blade edges. It weighs 13.0 g.\n\n\n\nThe blade fragment is a mid to dark brown colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has been removed in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze diseases) occurring. This would be a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue and silica gel.","fourFigureLat":"52.54312769","fourFigureLon":"-2.41429792","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"A similar blade fragment was recorded as WMID-277BF6. On that record, Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) noted that: As for the blade fragment - from the size I think you are looking at either a large dagger or probably more likely a rapier fragment. The hilt would have been trapezoidal - and it has lost its rivets and upper part - it has also lost the shoulders but you can then see the blade thickening away from the hilt to for the mid rib. I expect the other end continued for maybe 1/3 again as the rib is parallel even if the sides aren't due to plough roll.\n\n\n\nSimilar rapiers have been dated to the later Middle Bronze Age (MBA III - specifically the Penard phase / industry) - Rowlands 1976 p68-70) which corresponds with Needham's Period 5 (1500-1150 CAL BC).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"October 29, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Worfield","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-CD4C05.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"63.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
