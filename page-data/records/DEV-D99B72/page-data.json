Incomplete curved fragment from a sickle of middle to late Bronze Age date (c. 1400- c.800 BC). The blade curves from top to bottom, and tapers to a point at the end of the blade. There is a distinct central rib running along both faces of the blade. The blade is lenticular in section. Both the inner and outer edges of the blade have been bevelled, demonstrating use and re-use of the sickle.\n\n\n\nThis sickle was most likely socketed rather than tanged; the section is lentoid rather than being stepped, as is seen on tanged examples. Tanged sickles are known from the later Middle Bronze Age onwards, whereas socketed sickles date from the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nBronze Age sickles are rare and therefore this artefact is an important addition to our understanding of this Bronze Age tool type.","fourFigureLat":"50.56436475","fourFigureLon":"-3.55448232","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-800","notes":"This artefact was found in the 1990's, when it was originally shown to John Allan, who was curator at Exeter Museum at the time.
