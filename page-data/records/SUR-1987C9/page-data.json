The surviving portion of the axehead is 43mm in width and 39mm in length, comprising the front end which has a flared, curved blade edge, with pointed, almost hooked ends. The sides of the blade have four distinct facets, which taper to the blade edge. There is no evidence of any other decoration to either face. The break across the axehead reveals the interior to be hollow and the cross section to be of a flattened oval shape.","fourFigureLat":"51.63578615","fourFigureLon":"-1.92915133","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"\nRecorded from details emailed by the finder.\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ashton Keynes","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR1987C9.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
