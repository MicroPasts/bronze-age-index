It is copper-alloy and measures 21 mm wide at what remains of the blade tip, and 9 mm in length. It is difficult to gauge the original length of the blade tip as it is broken at one side, and it is also broken along its length. The fragment is 4 mm thick at its thickest, tapering to 0.5 mm at the tip. It is possible that this object represents the remains of a Bronze Age tool, but not enough of it remains to date it with any certainty based on a stylistic argument.","fourFigureLat":"52.225016","fourFigureLon":"-1.005913","fromdate":"2000","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"September 30, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harpole","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-F93553chiseltipobv.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
