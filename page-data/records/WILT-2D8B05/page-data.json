The sub-rectangular fragment comprises of a sction of the mouth and socket wall; the mouth appears to have been flaring, with a moulded collar beneath, but with no other indication of decoration on the surviving fragment. The cross-section of the fragment suggests an original cross-section which was relatively pronouncedly sub-hexagonal. \n\n\n\nDimensions: Length 38.9mm; width: 17.1mm; thickness at mouth 6.8mm; thickness at socket 4.9mm; weight: 16.46g. \n\n\n\nThe cross section of the peice would suggest a late Bronze Age, rather than early Iron Age date; although it is too fragmentary for precise classification.","fourFigureLat":"51.05127417","fourFigureLon":"-2.1297745","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jane Hanbidge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jane Hanbidge","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Tisbury","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sophaw123/WILT2D8B05.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"38.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
