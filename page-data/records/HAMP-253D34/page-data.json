Only a fragment of the axe survives. There are worn transverse breaks at both ends, leaving only part of the socket. The breaks appear old, however one, towards the butt end is more recent. The surviving section is sub-rectangular, with the sides expanding out towards what would have been the blade end. The fragment is rectangular in profile, with casting flashes along both sides. The axe has a worn surface and an even mid green patina. It is filled with compact soil. The axe fragment is 36.52mm long, 26.83mm wide and 13.18mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"51.077137","fourFigureLon":"-1.473221","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"1 of 4 fragments of different socketed axeheads found in the same area.
