The gouge itself is worn, possibly from water action, and is incomplete, most of the mouth having broken off.  There are a pair of faint incised transverse lines, presumably decoration, just below the mid- way point, around the back of the gouge.  The gouge measures 72.36mm in length, 18.14mm-20.07mm in width and it weighs 54g.  The wooden handle, which is shaped to fit the socket is 73.15mm long, 12.75mm-13.43mm wide and weighs 7g.  When the handle is inserted into the socket the combined object is 93.5mm long and weighs 61g.","fourFigureLat":"51.389764","fourFigureLon":"1.361971","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Richardson","datefound1":"April 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Richardson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"18.14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Kent","district":"Thanet","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/arichardson/PAK144-006.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"93.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
