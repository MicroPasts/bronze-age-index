It has a convex front and a flat reverse, creating a broadly semi-circular profile, which suggests it was cast in a single-piece mould.  The long outer edge is rounded whereas the edge that runs between the tang and the barb is mitred, creating approximately a parallelogram shaped tang and sub-triangular shaped barb.\n\n\n\nThe arrowhead has extensive deep pitting over both faces but particularly on the reverse.  It is dark grey-green in colour with patches of white and red on both faces.\n\n\n\nBroadly similar to: LEIC-13A0FE, ESS-A41D75, WMID-CE6A76, NARC-F9B223.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length: 32.00mm, width: 22.78mm, thickness: 4.18mm, weight: 2.59g.","fourFigureLat":"52.63291814","fourFigureLon":"0.11156998","fromdate":"-1275","todate":"-1140","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alexandra Cobby","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alexandra Cobby","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wisbech","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"Fenland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC9E5884.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
