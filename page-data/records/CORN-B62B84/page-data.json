The pestle is round in plan, with two rounded sides, and plano-convex in section. The pestle is flat and smooth on the face that was used for rubbing, and more convex on the opposite face, where it was held and pushed across a base or mortar for grinding. The gabbro is a coarse-grained variety, probably from Cudden Point, Perranuthnoe, about 4 miles across Mounts Bay (Jens Andersen pers comm), containing pale pink felspars and dark grey pyroxene inclusions. The soft felspars would work into hollows and the hard pyroxene, as a silicate mineral, would stand proud of the surface, thus allowing a shearing action to cut and grind the grain. The shape of the pestle suggests that it was made from a beach cobble. Jones (2002) illustrates a similar example excavated from Callestick on page 29, Fig.13, No.95 which is dated to the Later Bronze Age, c.1100-700 BC. Nowakowski (1991) illustrates a similar example excavated from Trethellan on page 142, Fig.57, No.87, which dates from the Middle Bronze Age, c.1500-1200 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.079285","fourFigureLon":"-5.565627","fromdate":"-2100","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"November 09, 2007","datefound2":"November 09, 2007","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum after being disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"51","discoveryContext":"Fieldwalking","parish":"Paul","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/May09finds 009.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"82"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
