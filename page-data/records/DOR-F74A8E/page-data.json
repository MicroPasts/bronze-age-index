The axe has the remains of the irregular globule of casting sprue at the cutting edge. Broadly sub-triangular with tapering parallel sides. The socket opening is oval. One face of the axe demonstrates a casting flaw which slightly distorts the profile of the object, though there are no casting seams visible anywhere on the object. A prominent sub-circular groove is visible on one edge of the axe, this is probably a failed attempt at creating a loop which may have served to suspend the piece, this is probably the reason why the object was not completed.\n\nReference: similar examples of completed miniature axe heads can be seen on the PAS database: PUBLIC-83FCAD, WMID-6F570A, PUBLIC-83C3D1\n\nDate: Late Bronze Age to Roman\n\nDimensions: 31.57 mm x 11.55 mm x 7.92 mm\n\nWeight: 9.12 g.","fourFigureLat":"51.08716507","fourFigureLon":"-2.18698531","fromdate":"1150","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Bevan","datefound1":"November 28, 2018","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Bevan","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.92","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"East Knoyle","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lucybev/DORF74A8Ea.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"31.57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
