The fragment consists of the cutting edge, blade and partial socket. It is rectangualr in plan, with parallel sides and a slightly convex cutting edge without flaring blade tips. In profile the blade tapers from the worn break to the cutting edge, with very pronounced casting seams creating a sub-hexagonal cross section, although with a rectangualr socket. Both faces have been decorated, although highly truncated, with two or more converging lines which meet just below the break.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 42.2mm; width 37.8mm; thickness 16.7mm; weight 94.55g.\n\n\n\nThe fragment probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC. The fragment is extraordinarily heavy for its size, suggesting a hihg lead content in the Bronze.","fourFigureLat":"50.29167952","fourFigureLon":"-3.75616466","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"This record is based on notes and photographs taken at a finds day, it may thus fall below our usual standards for recording and identification.
