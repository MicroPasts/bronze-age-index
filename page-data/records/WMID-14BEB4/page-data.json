The fragment is broken at both ends. In plan, the fragment tapers slightly from top to bottom and has broadly straight edges - although there are no cutting edges present. In section, the fragment is broadly lentoid in shape, although broad flat ridges run down the centre of both sides. The fragment is 27.3mm long, approximately 12.9mm wide at the top and approximately 10.3mm wide at the base. It is 3.5mm thick at the top and 3.2mm thick at the base. The fragment weighs 5.17g. The fragment has a well developed green patina, marked by a large number of striations and some fine grooves principally running down the object. The broken ends and incomplete long edges have a lighter green surface, suggesting that the breaks and damage was not recent. The object may be a Bronze Age (2150BC-800BC) blade fragment, but without further context or more of the object, no closer dating or identification is suggested.","fourFigureLat":"52.183814","fourFigureLon":"-1.679643","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Duncan Slarke","datefound1":"February 25, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Duncan Slarke","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stratford-upon-Avon","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/cov ba knife 0208 copy.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"27.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
