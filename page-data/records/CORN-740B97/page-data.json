There is a hole in the side of the socket below the blade but this is not a peg hole or the remains of a side-loop, but the result of corrosion. There does appear to be a curved edge on one side of the socket at the edge of the break, which may be part of a peg hole, in which case it may date from the Penard phase (c.1250-1125 BC) which is at the end of the Middle Bronze Age and has some transitional artefacts, such as early pegged spearheads, or the Wilburton phase (c.1125-975 BC) which is the earliest Late Bronze Age phase (Dr. Richard Davis pers comm).\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) in Part (ii) illustrates two similar examples on page 565, Plate 4, No.45 from St Erth, and No.48a, from Wheal Virgin streamworks, Pentewan, which also have broken sockets and points and therefore are not precisely dated.\n\n\n\nThere are also two pegged spearheads from the hoard found at Kilnhurst, South Yorkshire (Smith 1958), which are similar but a little larger. This hoard is dated to the Penard phase because of the associated objects (Dr. Richard Davis forthcoming).","fourFigureLat":"50.498063","fourFigureLon":"-4.299643","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-975","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"March 31, 2009","datefound2":"May 30, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Callington","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/May10finz 004.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
