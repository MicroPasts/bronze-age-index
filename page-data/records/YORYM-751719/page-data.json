The fragment is the blade end including part of the socketed area. The axehead has a tapering rectangle section and is sub-rectangular in plan with a widely flared cutting edge. The breaks are old and worn and faint casting flashes are present along one side.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a light greyish-green patina and is worn. The fragment is 51.1mm long, 33.1 to 20mm wide, 13.7mm thick and weighs 31.8g.\n\n\n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"54.22763134","fourFigureLon":"-0.78969079","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"13.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pickering","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Ryedale","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/SPB0001.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"51.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
