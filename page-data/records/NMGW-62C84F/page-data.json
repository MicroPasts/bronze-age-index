The socket is oval at the break (with maximum surviving external dimensions of 15.0mm x 10.7mm and 11.3mm x 8.5mm internal) with no mouth mouldings present on the incomplete socket. Beneath the break is the beginning of groove, of V-shaped profile near the top and becoming U-shaped towards the blade. The sides of the gouge are straight and parallel (producing a blade width also of 15.0). The casting seams are no longer evident on either side. The blade comprises a shallow U-shaped depression and is evident below the break (39.2mm from the blade edge). The blade edge has moderate damage and is not significantly expanded. Linear striations are evident running along the groove. The surface has a dark brown patina with patches of a dark-green patina.\n\n\n\nThe missing mouth makes typological identification difficult, Savory (1980, p 55)[2] suggests that the earliest socketed gouges such as those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings, whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar.\n\n\n\n[1] Needham, S. 1996; Chronology and Periodisation in the British Bronze Age , Acta Archaeologica 67, p. 121-140\n\n\n\n[2] Savory H.N. 1980, Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections, National Museum of Wales","fourFigureLat":"51.74662995","fourFigureLon":"-4.3770124","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Ishmael","county":"Carmarthenshire","district":"Carmarthenshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.181.1jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"41.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
