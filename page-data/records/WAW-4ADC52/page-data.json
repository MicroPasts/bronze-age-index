The lower portion of the axe remains, including a fragment of at the body and complete blade. One face of the body is more complete than the other, therefore revealing the socket. The interior of the socket is slight rough and there are moulded linear striations as if the metal has incorporated the striations of organic matter. The plan the axe is a sub-trapezoid with the upper edge is an obliquely angled broken edge. The break is not recent as there are traces of patina over the break. The sides of the axe taper outwards slightly towards the blade tip. The casting seams are just visible on the sides. The blade tips are not flared outwards. The blade cutting edge is rounded and blunt, and is slightly convex in plan. The surface of the axe is heavily abraded and there are traces of a light grey/green patina, with further patches of a shiny grey patina. The axe weighs 86.96g. From the cutting edge to the upper edge it measures 57.88mm, across the blade, from tip to tip to measures 43.64mm and 17.08mm thick.\n\nA similar axe was recorded from the Llyn Fawr hoard (Rohl, B. and Needham, S. 1998 The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis British Museum Occasional Paper No. 102.), Figure 40, Nos. 401, 404 and 405. These axes also have the relatively straight sides leading to the blade tips and the slightly convex blade edge. The Llyn Fawr hoard is dated to the late Bronze Age (c. 800 to c. 650 BC), therefore the recorded axe can be dated, also, to the late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"52.228442","fourFigureLon":"-1.576837","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-650","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"March 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.08","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wasperton","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Warwick","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-4ADC52.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"57.88"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
