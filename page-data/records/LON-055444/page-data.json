The  socket is sub-circular, a square with very rounded corners.  The edge of the socket is decorated with a pronounced rim and  a parallel raised transverse band just below.  This second transverse band is vestigial and very faint.  The axe head has a side loop that abuts the lower  moulded band.  The axe head is wedge-shaped in plan.   The sides of the axe head flare out gently towards the blade tip. There are decorative mouldings forming two ribs along each of the face edges.    A casting seam is visible along both  edges.  The axehead has a curved cutting edge which shows  some wear and evidence of sharpening.  The blade is hollow.  There is a casting flaw on the rim, an air bubble at the top of the rim.  There appears to be a fragment of wood surviving within the socket.\n\n\nThis socketed axe head is similar to others found in the Ewert Park  assemblage and dated 1000-800BC (Rohl & Needham 1998: 136-7).\n\n\nDimensions: length: 102.4mm; width of blade: 53.6mm; thickness of rim: 33.34mm; internal diameter of socket:  23.88mm; internal length of socket: 76.84mm; weight: 192.8g.\n\n\nReference: Rohl, B. and Needham, S. 1998.
