The remaining portion consists of part of the flanged end of the axe, from near the middle, broken at each end. The breaks are patinated. On the outside of one of the flanges is a small, blunt protrusion which is probably part of a side loop. There is no evidence of a stop on the surviving part. The axe has an even, dark green patina and the classic H shaped croiss-section. It is 48.3mm long, 33.3mm wide and 20.3mm thick. It weighs 64.66gm.\n\n\n\nOther palstave fragments where the loop does not bridge the stop (so the loop is entirely on the hafted end of the axe) are IOW-DC7263 and the complete example DOR-8D4C40.","fourFigureLat":"54.20520442","fourFigureLon":"-0.40704297","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jack Coulthard","datefound1":"December 05, 2014","datefound2":"March 05, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jack Coulthard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Folkton","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Scarborough","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2519_BA2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"48.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
