The head is logenze shaped and slightly assymmetrical, probably due to repeated sharpening during its uselife. The head is double-bladed, with semi-circular central ribbing on both faces. The blades are dull and uneven with a number of knicks clearly seen. There are no remains of a socket mount, though some of the socket is visible inside the base of the head.","fourFigureLat":"53.237629","fourFigureLon":"-0.023621","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"September 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tetford","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"East Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"110"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
