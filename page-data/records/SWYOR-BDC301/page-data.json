Only part of the butt of the palstave survives. It is trapezoidal in plan and shaped like a serifed capital I in section. It tapers from 4.1mm thick at the broken end to1.68mm at the butt, not including the flanges. The metal is patinated to a green colour all over, and is deeply pitted in common with other poorly preserved Bronze Age objects. Palstaves date from the middle Bronze Age, about 1500 BC - 1150 BC. Compare NLM-10F757 for a similar fragment, but with different patination.","fourFigureLat":"53.503418","fourFigureLon":"-1.262723","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"September 30, 2011","datefound2":"May 31, 2012","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.59","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barnburgh","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1916_17_Bronze_Age.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"20.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
