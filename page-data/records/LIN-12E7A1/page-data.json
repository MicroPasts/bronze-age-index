Only part of the blade located near to the terminal (tip-end) survives. It is lozenge in section and has a pronounced rib running down the centre on both sides. The entire perimeter is damaged. Much of the blade is pitted with bright green patches of corrosion, however, the original surface is smooth and has a mid-brown patina. One of the breaks is irregular and does not appear to have been done intentionally; the other, however, is more regula, straight, and might be the result of having been cut.\n\n\n\n38mm x 21mm x 4mm. 12.58g.\n\n\n\nThis item possibly dates to the Ewart park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1,000-700BC).","fourFigureLat":"53.4594918","fourFigureLon":"-0.43509125","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"South Kelsey","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN12E7A1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"38"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
