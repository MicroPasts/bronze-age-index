The blade portion of the axe remains with the broken edge traversing the axe and revealing the socket. The blade cutting edge is asymmetrical, rounded and blunt, and is convex in plan. The blade has slightly flared sides. The break is not recent as the patina on the break matches that on the surface of the axe. The surface of the axe is abraded, but has patches of a well developed dark green/brown patina. From the cutting edge to the broken edge it measures 41mm, and from the corner of the blade to the broken edge it measures 15.12mm.\n\nThe axe is a socketed axe dating to the late Bronze Age, c.1150 to 700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.32564007","fourFigureLon":"-1.23843137","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"Recorded from images taken by the finder.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Barby","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
