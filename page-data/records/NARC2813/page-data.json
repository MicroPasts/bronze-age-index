One face of the blade has a large section of mineralised organic woven material attached.  The blade has no obvious midrib of facets, there is a single moulded ridge at the junction between the socket and the blade.  The socket is slightly 'waisted' in plan, with a single shallow mouth-moulding.  There is a circular aperture, presumably the peg hole, on one face and a corroded hole on the other, presumably at the point of the aperture on that side. The mouth is oval, the socket is a waisted oval in cross-section, and sub-triangular in profile.","fourFigureLat":"50.661382","fourFigureLon":"-1.124177","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Width is given at widest point, thickness is at socket.\n \n\n Part of a hoard of eleven implements.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Rhiannon Harte","datefound1":"February 01, 2002","datefound2":"March 01, 2002","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15.56","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"Sandown","county":"Isle of Wight","district":"Isle of Wight","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sworrell/IOW2002-26 Kirkton Hoard.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Finder","length":"132.17"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
