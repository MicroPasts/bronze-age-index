Caverton type. \n\nThe axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a rounded butt end, and concave and wasted sides which flare to a crescentic blade.\n\nTwo integral lateral lozenge shaped flanges are present along either side, rising steadily from the butt, rounding off at the apex midway along the body, before sloping steadily back down to the mid-point of the sides. The exterior surfaces of the flanges have been filed smooth leaving no visible casting lines.\n\nA slight steepening to the profile of the axe is present slightly above where the flanges meet the body representing a very slight stop-ridge. D-shaped panels are present below the stop ridge.\n\nThe metal has a dark brown patina with some delamintation. The axehead is 154.9mm long, 74.9mm wide at the blade, 27.2mm wide at the butt end, 33.1mm thick at the widest point of the flanges, and weighs 530g.\n\nSchmidt and Burgess illustrate similar examples on plate 36 (e.g. No.443) which are dated to the EBA-MBA transition, c.1600-1400 cal BC (1981: 85-86).\n\nRef:\n\nSchmidt, P.
