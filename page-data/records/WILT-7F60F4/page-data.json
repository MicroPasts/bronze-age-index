The fragment consists of a sub-triangular, curving fragment of blade, with a central mid-rib tapering into the edges in cross section. The fragment is truncated by an old break, with all edges being abraded. \n\n\n\nLength: 20.3mm; width: 15.6mm; thickness: 2.1mm; weight: 1.83g.\n\n\n\ncf. a similar, but more complete sickle found at Edington Burtle (Pearce 1983: 512-513, no. 648).
