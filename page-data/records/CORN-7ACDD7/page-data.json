The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 35 mm. The length of the flat axe is only 90 mm so it is about half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now very pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axe on page 502, Plate 69, No.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, and a short but wider example of a broad Migdale type flat axe from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall, on page 418, Plate 12, No.98c, which both are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\n\n\nCowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axe with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, Fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nThere are similar miniature Migdale type flat axes recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a 'Biggar' variant of the Migdale type of flat axe, but these have slightly crescentic blades.\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.
