One end tapers to a point and is sub circular in shape. The edges of the fragment gradually taper outwards and the fragment develops a square cross section. An old break is present across the top of the fragment.\n\n\nThe fragment measures 50.84 mm in length, 25.09 mm wide and has a maximum thickness of 8.38 mm. It weighs 41.0 grams.\n\n\nThe fragment is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface and detail. The patina has flaked away in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green area. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (a bright green powdery residue) occurring. To reduce the risk of this happening, the fragment should be stored in a sealed dry, air tight environment, such as a tupperware box lined with acid free tissue paper and silica gel.\n\n\nThis fragment is probably the butt of a late flat axe something like a type Migdale or Type Alyesford which may or may not have a proto stop ridge or slight raised side flanges, although it may have possibly been developed into a long flanged axehead. These are of Early Bronze Age dating .\n\n\nComment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): Although incomplete this axe best fits into the final phases of the Migdale metalworking tradition Type: Migdale - decorated variant. However, it does share some of the characteristics (mostly of blade shape) of the Developed Flat Axes specifically variants Falkland and Scrabo Hill. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL.
