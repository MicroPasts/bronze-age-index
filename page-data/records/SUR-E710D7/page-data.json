The blade itself expands from 8.1mm wide at the collar to 21.3mm wide at the cutting edge, which is noticeably asymmetrical, possibly from wear during use or post depositional corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.26575863","fourFigureLon":"-1.42806949","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"Tanged chisels of this type are uncommon finds; examples recorded on the database include BH-49EAD8, NMS-5059F9 and BERK-52E8C3.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"September 21, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Mary Bourne","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURE710D7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"58.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
