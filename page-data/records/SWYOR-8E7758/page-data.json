The fragment consists of only the very tip of the spearhead - it has a narrow and slender tip with a pronounced midrib. The midrib is sub-triangular in section and is flanked by tapering wings that join at the tip. The tip damaged and abraded. The slenderness of the spear-tip suggests a long narrow spear head, although as only the very tip survives it is not possible to identify the exact form or class of spear head. Although only a fragment survives, such elongated examples, with a mid-rib which extends to the tip, and which is flanked by wings as described above, might belong to the incorporated or projecting basal looped categories, Davis Groups 8 or 9, dated to the later Middle Bronze Age, 'current in the Taunton and Penard periods', 1400 - 1125 BC (Davis 2017).","fourFigureLat":"53.428607","fourFigureLon":"-0.887757","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1125","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"May 14, 2011","datefound2":"May 14, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.72","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walkeringham","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Bassetlaw","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1519_Spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"41.32"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
