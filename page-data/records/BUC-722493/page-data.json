In cross section from the top the axehead is H shaped. After the stop ridge the axehead flares out to form a wide curved blade which measures 72.9mm in width. In profile the blade is triangular and narrows to a sharp edge. There are a couple of small breaks and notches in the blade edge. In cross section from the side the axehead is composed of two ovals. On both sides there is a irregular casting seem running the length of the axehead. The axehead is similar to the shield-patterned pastaves from Acton, however there is no 'shield shaped' impression below the stop ridge.\n\n\n\nThe axhead is dark brown with orange and green patches. There are circular holes, both large and small, on both sides from casting. The axehead measures 165mm in length, 26.2mm in width across the body, and weighs 434g.\n\n\n\nC.f.
