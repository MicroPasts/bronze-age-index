The object is lozenge shaped in section with two 'wings'. It tapers gradually to a point, although point is somewhat blunt. The arrowhead is solid, although it is clearly broken before the attachment end so it is difficult to determine whether it would originally have been socketed or tanged. It measures 37.99 mm long, 10.3 mm thick and weighs 7.7 grams. It has a rough green patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.534138","fourFigureLon":"-2.414213","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"July 26, 2010","datefound2":"September 27, 2010","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Worfield","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-3AE711.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"37.99"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
