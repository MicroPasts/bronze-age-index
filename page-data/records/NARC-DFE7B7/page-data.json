The object is a fragment of an uncertain type of Flat or Developed Axe form. The object is composed of the butt end which is broken toward the blade end by an old, abraded and irregular break. The retained butt end is abraded but is rectangular in plan and section and tapers out toward the body of the object both in plan and section.  The sides are straight and slightly divergent for their short lengths to the break. There is no indication of flanges retained within the fragment.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form, absence of flanges and the presumed bronze composition would be consistent with axes of Needham's type 3 and in relation to Schmidt and Burgess (1981) typology may have been of Migdale, Aylesford or allied types. Axes of these types are likely to be date to the Early Bronze Age, perhaps between c. 2200 - 1800BC.\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark to mid green in colour with some original smooth surface patina and large areas of pitting and abrasion.\n\n\n\nLength: 34.35mm, Width: 27.52mm, Thickness: 10.09mm, Weight: 31.6g","fourFigureLat":"52.40317302","fourFigureLon":"-0.825524","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.09","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cransley","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Kettering","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARCDFE7B7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"34.35"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
