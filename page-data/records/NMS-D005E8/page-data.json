The blade is leaf-shaped with a lozengiform-sectioned midrib. The edges have been substantially chipped and abraded. The tip is missing. The hollow socket expands to a circular-sectioned mouth 17.9mm in diameter (internal diameter 12.4mm).\n\n\n\nCasting ribs are visible running along both sides of the body from the mouth to the point at which the blade commences. On one side, the casting rib has been filed, on the other it has been left. Similarly, a casting rib is visible running from the tip of the blade down the body to the socket on both faces. One has been filed, the other is untouched. On either side of the socket are the stubs of loops. These appear to have been filed down. Between the stubs on one side is an irregualrly shaped hole which appears to be casting flaw. On the opposite side a hole has been drilled.\n\n\n\nTotal length: 125.5mm, maximum width: 28.1mm, minimum width: 11.4mm, maximum thickness: 9.9mm, minimum thickness: 1.5mm, weight: 61.1g.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead has a mottled dark brown patina with patches of green.\n\n\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).\n\n\n\nCf.
