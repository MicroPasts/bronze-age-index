(c. 1500-c. 1100 BC). Treasure case no. 2014 T15.\n\n\n\nThe object is largely sub-rectangular in plan, rectangular in cross-section and has been folded widthways through c. 180Â°. The narrow end is in the form of a hook-like terminal and is square in cross-section. The sides flare outwards from the hook to form a 'tab' with a break at the end. Part of the break is uneven and probably accidental and the other part has been deliberately chopped obliquely. Both faces are plain and have small scuffs and scratches. The bundle is formed by numerous thin and narrow ribbons which have been tightly compressed together. Following its discovery the bundle was detached by the finder in order to remove soil.\n\n\n\nThe artefact is closely paralleled by two conjoined objects classified as rings (possibly ear ornaments), from Binstead, West Sussex (TAR: 1998-1999, p. 10-11, fig. 3a).\n\n\n\nA similar object, classified as a bracelet, has been recorded from Northfleet, Kent (TAR: 2004 T326; PAS: KENT-AAA333).\n\n\n\nIn discussing the Kent bracelet, Stuart Needham has commented:\n\n\n\n'Its features do match those of a type of bracelet which occurs in just two Welsh hoards, from Capel Isaf, Dyfed, and Maesmelan Farm, Powys. The type, known as Capel Isaf, comprises a flat band strengthened by triangular-section beadings along either edge. At either terminal the band tapers quickly to a hooked tang, one of which is rod-like, the other a flatter strip; these two interlock to close the bracelet. The Northfleet fragment appears to have had a narrower band than the Welsh parallels, but its metal composition is similar with low copper and between about 9 and 16 % silver. Making this identification does not necessarily offer definitive dating since the type is not associated with datable objects. The Capel Isaf hoard contains, in addition to two of this type, two more broad-band bracelets which are plainer in design, and a small fragment of twisted strip which is likely to be the terminal of another ornament (Savory 1977: 37-53; Savory 1980: no 302, 195 fig. 46, pl. VIII). The Maesmelan Farm hoard has a simple rectangular section penannular bracelet in association with one of Capel Isaf type (Green et al 1983: 394-398). The prevailing opinion is that these are of Bronze Age date and, if so, they are likely to date to before the middle of the Bronze Age (circa 1500/1400 BC), after which the copper content of the gold rises significantly. A mature Early Bronze Age or earliest Middle Bronze Age date is feasible and would tie in with a similar date for the Heyope ribbon torcs with similar terminals from a hoard in Powys.'\n\n\n\nBracelet or ring: 32.61mm (length); 65.80mm (length if straightened); 15.38mm (width); 1.29mm (thickness). Weight: 7.81g.\n\n\n\nBundle: 13.21mm (length); 11.9mm (width); 4.29mm (thickness); 0.89mm (width of individual piece of ribbon). Weight: 1.39g.\n\n\n\nOverall weight: 9.20g.\n\n\n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a group of eight ornaments was undertaken by Sue La Niece at the British Museum. It indicated a surface composition for the bracelet fragment of approximately 89-91% gold, 8-10 % silver with approximately 1% copper. The surface composition of the wire is approximately 86-88% gold, approximately 10-12% silver and approximately 1% copper.The full report is appended.","fourFigureLat":"50.69971187","fourFigureLon":"-1.53409693","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"The find contains a minimum of 10% gold and predates 1714.
