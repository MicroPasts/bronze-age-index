It is also possible that the fragment is from a dirk or rapier. The blade is lentoid in cross-section with edge bevels on both faces. Both ends are broken and the damage does not appear to be recent. The breaks are patinated but not worn. The fragment tapers and has straight edges. The surface has been recently slightly damaged in the centre where the patina is missing. There appears to be post depositional bending in the centre, causing cracks in the patina, which is a blue-green colour where it is undisturbed. The fragment is 103.1mm long; 36.3mm wide narrowing to 27.3mm; 6.3mm thick, and it weighs 117.5g.\n\n\n\nSee https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/swords. This fragment is probably most likely to be from a Wilburton or Ewart Park type sword but could also be from the Taunton or Penard style phases. Compare WMID-871F5F and YORYM-17D783.\n\n\n\nThe location of the findspot in the Aire Valley, fairly near to the burial mounds and henge at Ferrybridge, may be significant, and could suggest intentional deposition in a riverine environment, perhpas after being deliberately broken.","fourFigureLat":"53.74635257","fourFigureLon":"-1.30396873","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"\nBronze Age swords are not common finds in North Yorkshire, so it has been made a find of note.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Joan Tozer","datefound1":"May 11, 2020","datefound2":"May 11, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Scriven","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Fairburn","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Selby","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYOR99BACABronzeAgeSword.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"103.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
