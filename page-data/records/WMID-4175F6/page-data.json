BC 2250 - c. BC 1900. This fits with Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.\n\n\n\nThe axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid (pointed oval) in shape. The edges of the axe have been damaged but much of it remains. The sides of the axe gently exapnd in width from the rounded rectangular butt to the blade. The edges of the axe have been raised slightly on both sides forming shallow flanges. There is a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) about a third of the way down the axe, this is present on both front and reverse faces but is clearer on the front face. The ridge is not especially prominent however there is a distinct bevel (change of angle) from butt to ridge and from ridge to blade Below the bevel the sides continue to exapnd. The area from the ridge to the blade junction shows evidence of being decorated. The decoration is in the form of a series of parrallel linear lentoid lozenges, these seem to be diagonal and seem to be angled in different directions, although this is difficult to see clearly. This form of decoration is known as rain patternand is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition and early Aylesford tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. The patination is heavily damged and abraded it is difficult to tell whether there is further decoratio. The decoration stops at the blade facet. Below the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade taper slightly to form a shallow crescent shaped blade, a distinct blade facet is present. The right edge of the blade on the front face shows signs of ancient damage, probably as a result of time and movement whilst within the plough soil.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 91.2 mm in length, the butt is 19.4 mm wide and the blade measures 39.7 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.5 mm, the ridge measures 7.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 87.8 g.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is a mid green to mid brown in colour with a highly polished patina which has been damage across much of the surface, especially on the reverse. Probably as a direct of the movement of the object whilst within the plough soil. There are, however, a series of large scars which have removed areas of decoration. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the decorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. This axehead forms part of the corpus of earliest developed bronze axes of Britain. Other broadly similar examples of this type of axehead have been recorded in Schmidt and Burgess (1981), plate 27, (or page 61), No 310 or 312. \n\n\n\nRef:\n\n\n\nSchmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C.B. 1981.
