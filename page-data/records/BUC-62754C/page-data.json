Only half of the bracelet survives with both ends terminating in an old break. It is plain and circular in cross-section. The bracelet narrows to a slightly thinner end. One end is 10.9mm in diameter and the other end is 8.5mm in diameter. The bracelet has green and almost black patina with some brown patches. There are scratch marks which could possibly be due to over cleaning.\n\n\n\nThe bracelet is 77.4mm long, 11.1mm maximum thickness, and weighs 78g.\n\n\n\nSimilar bracelets can be seen in Rowlands 1976, BAR 31 (ii), plates 11 & 13.","fourFigureLat":"51.17055138","fourFigureLon":"-0.0846662","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helena Costas","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helena Costas","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ringmer","county":"East Sussex","district":"Lewes","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hcostas/BUC62754C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"77.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
