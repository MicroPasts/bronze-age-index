The axe is a relatively short example. \n\n\n  \n  The socket rim is a rectangular with rounded corners and edges. The rim on the exterior of the axe is moulded with a single ridge which tapers towards the body of the axe. The rim is regular, therefore the socket mouth is also a rectangular shape. The interior of the socket is smooth, no casting seams or ribs are visible. \n\n\n  \n  The body of the axe is short and wide. The blade tips flare outwards quickly, and they are asymmetrical. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical, this maybe due to ware, or the cutting edge being slightly abraded. Otherwise the cutting edge is quite sharp. \n\n\n  \n  The sides are straight until they reach the blade tips. They have casting seams visible. One side has the integral semi-circular loop positioned near the rim. In section the loop is a sub-lozenge shape, which is mainly due to the casting seams. \n\n\n  \n  The exterior surface of the axe has a patchy surface which has the start of a patina. There is some recent damage, scrapes, on the surface. \n\n\n  \n  The axe weighs 72.47g. From the cutting edge to the rim it measures 53.9mm, across the blade, from tip to tip to measures 35.7mm and the depth of the socket rim is 25.2mm.","fourFigureLat":"52.013336","fourFigureLon":"-2.147115","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Twyning","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Tewkesbury","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-E12B22 Drawing.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"53.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
