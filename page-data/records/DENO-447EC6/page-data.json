It has a pronounced midrib that extends to the tip, The blade edges are very worn and taper to a worn blunted point. The butt end terminates in what appears to be an ancient break. Overall, the shape is consistent with a side-looped socketed spear head, but not enough of the object remains for definite identification. The object may be the tip of a rapier - its cross-section is very similar to that of a rapier - but it is more likely to be the tip of a spearhead.\n\n\n\nThe object has an even dark green patina, with some pitting and corrosion.\n\n\n\nOverall, the object measures 59.5 mm long, 14.8 mm wide (tapering to 3.7 mm at the tip) and 9.7 mm thick. It weighs 16.14 g.\n\n\n\nA similar object is recorded as WMID-B2794D","fourFigureLat":"53.09749377","fourFigureLon":"-1.06059605","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Nicholson","datefound1":"January 01, 2017","datefound2":"April 01, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Nicholson","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Farnsfield","county":"Nottinghamshire","district":"Newark and Sherwood","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENO447EC6.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"59.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
