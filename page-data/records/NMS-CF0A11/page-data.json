Fragment of socketed axe head. A tiny section of the moulded mouth with a narrow moulding below, D-sectioned loop and broken, irregular part of one side and face. Internal casting seam on one face and external casting seam above loop. Breaks irregular, ancient and quite worn. Surviving length 41mm. Surviving width 35mm. Weight 27.0g.\n\n\n\n2. Possible fragment from an axe head or other copper alloy object, consistent with bronze objects of a similar date to No. 1. Wedge-shaped, broken on two sides, the surviving original edges damaged and corroded. Surviving length 21mm. Surviving width 24mm. Thickness at break 11mm. Weight 18.1g.\n\n\n\nProbably Late Bronze Age, 1000 - 700 BC","fourFigureLat":"52.54162395","fourFigureLon":"1.00684769","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"Although object No. 2 cannot be certainly ascribed to a known Bronze Age artefact type because of its condition, its proximity to object No. 1 (of known Bronze Age date) and the fact that its form and condition is not inconsistent with objects of Bronze Age date, it can, on the balance of probability, be described a dispersed hoard.
