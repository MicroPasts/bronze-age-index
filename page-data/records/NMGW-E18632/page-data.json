The axe may be judged a small example with a maximum surviving length of 66.00mm and has a width of 32.05mm beneath the loop. The socket has a maximum surviving depth of 50.76mm and has the suggestion of an internal rib on the looped side, ending 23.8mm from the base of the socket. The axe has broken across the loop, which is comparatively substantial with a width of 9.21mm. The sides are slightly concave and the casting seams are evident on both sides, which appear neatly finished. At the blade, the sides out-turn gently to produce a moderately expanded and curved blade edge with a surviving width of 40.45mm. The axe has a sub-rectangular body profile. No decoration is now evident on the face. The incomplete axe weighs 69.6g and has poor surface preservation, with only very small islands of the original surface surviving with a dark green patina.","fourFigureLat":"52.671373","fourFigureLon":"-3.31763","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"Although few diagnostic features survive, the axe may be confidently ascribed to the Ewart Park metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950 - 750BC.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"July 31, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Welshpool","county":"Powys","district":"Powys","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.166.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"66"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
