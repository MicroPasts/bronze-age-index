The chisel blade is wedge shaped, widening from 9 mm nearest the tang to 12 mm at the tip of the blade. The blade also decreases in thickness, from 4.6 mm nearest the tang to 1.2 mm at the blade's end. The item is thickest where the blade meets the tang, at 6.5 mm, and at this point it is decorated with a thin band which loops the object. The blade is 19 mm in length and the tang is 26 mm long. The tang is cone shaped and narrows to a point at the end where it would have been set within a handle. The item is 45 mm in total length.","fourFigureLat":"52.225495","fourFigureLon":"-1.064463","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-800","notes":"This item was found in an area which has produced evidence of bronze working, along with some fragments of probable Bronze Age axes, a worked flint, and a linen smoother or polishing stone. It is therefore possible that the activity at this site represents a Bronze Age manufacturing process.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"September 30, 2003","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Flore","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-742185 -BAchisel.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
