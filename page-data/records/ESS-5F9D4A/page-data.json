The thickness of the walls is approx. 1.5mm. Both the front and back edges are broken, so that only the lower portion of the chape remains. \n\n\n\nThe slightly longer back face has two drilled holes present (likely to attachment to a belt), each with an approximate diameter of 2.1mm.\n\n\n\nThe patina is mostly worn, with some patches of smoother copper-alloy of a dark brown colour. The wron areas are light green in colour.\n\n\n\nDimensions: weight: 19.02g, length: 28.1mm, width: 41.2mm, thickness: 11.5mm","fourFigureLat":"51.74274493","fourFigureLon":"0.5623284","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"These chapes are associated with the 'carp's tongue complex' of south-east England and date to the Ewart Park metalworking phase.
