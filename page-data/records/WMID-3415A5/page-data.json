The fragment is sub rectangular in shape, and triangular in cross section. The socket is rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along one of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at the sides. The blade edge is damaged.\n\n\n\nThe axehead fragment measures 23.5 mm in length, 34.8 mm wide (at the blade), 31.2 mm wide (at the body), 10.5 mm thick (at the body), 3.6 mm thick (at the blade edge). It weighs 34.0 g.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.\n\n\n\nNot enough of the axehead is present to determine whether it is the tip of a socketed axehead, a palstave or a flat axehead. Therefore a broad date range has been suggested.","fourFigureLat":"52.1481791","fourFigureLon":"-1.84065755","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"September 30, 2019","datefound2":"September 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bidford-on-Avon","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID3415A5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"23.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
