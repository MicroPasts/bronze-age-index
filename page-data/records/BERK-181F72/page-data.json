Only part of the blade edge survives intact, the remainder now missing due to old breaks. The blade edge is flat, having narrowed from further up the axe head, and in convex in form. In cross section the fragment is solid and an elongated lozenge-shape in plan. The fragment has a dark green patina. This is a fragment from the blade of a Bronze Age axe, however due to the preservation of the object it is uncertain whether it belongs to a flat axe, a palstave or socketed axe however it is likely to be of Middle or Late Bronze Age date, and therefore date to c. 1500-800 BC.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear whether this and a second fragment from the same field (BERK-18CBA6) are related more than chronologically- scrap metal hoards of Bronze Age date are not uncommon discoveries, having been collected so that the metal could be melted down and reused. The two pieces have very different patina however and were found quite a distance apart, so it may be more likely that these finds represent general dispersed activity in the landscape.","fourFigureLat":"51.57057183","fourFigureLon":"-1.26553917","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"June 30, 2014","datefound2":"October 18, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.52","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Blewbury","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2014560.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"13.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
