The butt or hilt is missing with no evidence for rivet holes or a tang but the top of the blade does not appear to be widening (with a width of 17.2mm). The blade has a prominent rounded midrib of consistent width and thickness (of 4.0mm width and 4.0mm thick). The original blade edges have been lost but the surviving edge is comparatively straight (with a maximum surviving width of 24.8mm) for most of its surviving length. The blade appears to taper near one end (from approximately 39mm) and is likely to have been approaching the missing tip. There is the suggestion of a slight step from the midrib to the blade and the blade profile appears to be slightly convex. There is clear suggestion of a bend prior to breaking at the fracture. The surface is heavily corroded with dark-green patina and with suggestions of sharpening striations.","fourFigureLat":"53.30027799","fourFigureLon":"-3.35191911","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"\nThe following comment has been offered by Mr Matt Knight (pers. comm.):\n\n\n\nBent and broken blades are known throughout the Bronze Age, with fragmentation particularly common in the Late Bronze Age. The form of this is blade is suggestive of a Late Bronze Age form, perhaps the lower blade of a sword. The breakage into several pieces, as well as the associated bend, may indicate this damage was the result of intent. However, bending and breakage has been known to occur through use.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Flintshire","district":"Flintshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/20142056jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"75.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
