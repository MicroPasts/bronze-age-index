The axe displays hammering on its blade and has a shield-shaped hollow below its stop ridge.\n\n\nThe axe measures 104.24mm long and is 21.27mm wide. The blade is narrow and measures 25.44mm across. The distance from the apex to the inside of the stop is 41.87 and the maximum width of the septum is 6.16mm. The upper inside edges of the socket exhibit signs of polish caused by wear. The  flashing on the long edges are trimmed and hammered flat. The apex is notched.","fourFigureLat":"51.547725","fourFigureLon":"-0.703459","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"Peter Reavill comments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of an unlooped primary shield pattern palstave - Early Palstaves Group I  (after Schmidt and Burgess), probably best paralled against examples in  Schmidt and Burgess, cat no - 777-779. These are described as having  shallow depressions below the stop ridge sometimes augmented with a  raised moulding (unlke this example).
