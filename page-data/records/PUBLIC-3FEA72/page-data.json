The blade-end has a flared edge; the socketed interior of the axehead is visible down into this fragment, with a sub-rectangular aperture running parallel with the edge of the blade.  A portion of the rest of the axehead seems to have fallen into this opening, however as it has corroded into place, it is uncertain what portion of the axehead these fragments originate from.  The surface condition of the axehead is poor, with areas of brownish-green patination interspersed with areas suffering from bronze disease and areas of intermittent condition.  It measures 41.3 mm long, approximately 47 mm wide at blade-end, with a 14.4 mm maximum thickness; the fragment weighs 65.2 grams.  For similar types of socketed axeheads, cf. Savory 1980, p. 172, fig. 24, esp. nos. 184-200.","fourFigureLat":"50.82823717","fourFigureLon":"-0.69509167","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"November 01, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sarah Hoile","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Oving","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/PUBLIC-3FEA72LBAAxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"41.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
