The object has side flanges which are highest at the break and then become lower towards the blade. 15.5mm from the break, there are a series of ridges visible on both sides of the object. These extend towards the blade and stop just beyond the termination of the side flanges. The blade flattens and widens from the ridges to a maximum width of 64.84 mm. There is a little bit of damage to one side of the blade tip.\n\n\n\nThe blade is in quite good condition aside from the missing section. There is a fairly even brown patina with small sections of more active green corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"54.22406455","fourFigureLon":"-1.60271879","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lauren Proctor","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lauren Proctor","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25.28","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Well","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/a8622912/DUR-863704.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Durham County Council","length":"86.67"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
