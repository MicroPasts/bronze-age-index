It is made from cast copper. The tool has a rectangular section. Three quarters of the length of the tool gradually tapers towards the terminal. This terminal is thought to be the blade. In profile it has a ‘>’ shape which Phil Watson (Principle Curator, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) suggests it may have been used as a chisel rather than an awl. The last quarter of the tool quickly tapers to a blunt point. The corners are rounded compared to the sharp corners on the rest of the tool. This final quarter also has a different corrosion pattern to the majority of the surface. The majority of the surface has traces of a dark green patina, otherwise it is a matte mottled brown/green colour. The final quarters’ surface is a light powdery green with patches of orange stains. This is probably the tang for the handle, and the thickening approximately a quarter from the handle terminal is probably where the handle was wedged in place.\n\nThe chisel measures 65.29mm long, 9.23mm wide and 7.32mm thick. It weighs 22.61g.\n\nThe chisel is possibly Bronze Age, if it is, the dating may be narrowed to the early Middle Bronze Age, c. 1500 to 1300 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.852518","fourFigureLon":"-0.622122","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Phil Watson","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"January 26, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.32","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Berkhamsted","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"Dacorum","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-C4A5F5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"65.29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
