One end narrows relatively quickly (over c.10.1mm.) to a soft point that is tall (1.9mm) and thin (0.7mm). The opposite end narrows over a far longer distance (over c.20.4mm). This length of thw awl is bent slightly downwards and ends in a soft (square sectioned) point.\n\n\n\nThe awl is a medium green colour and slightly abraded.\n\n\n\nThe awl is 53.8mm long, 5.1mm wide and 4.9mm thick. It weighs 5.40 grams\n\n\n\nAwls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Referred to as \"pointed punches\" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin.  Plain awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).
