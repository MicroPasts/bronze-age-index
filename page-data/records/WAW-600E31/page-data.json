At one end the point tapers in a sub-circular section. The tang end is flattened and becomes sub-rectangular in section. The shaft is rectangular in section. The surface of the awl is worn with an uneven dark green and mid brown surface patina. Identified as probably dating to the Bronze Age owning to the fabric of the object. However, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rodgers: 2002 Craft, Industry and Everyday Life: Finds from Medieval York, p2729-2730. Ottaway and Rodgers note that although most awls are associated with leather working, some would have been used in woodworking, bone working and other crafts. A similar awl is recorded under reference SWYOR-320717.\n\n\n\nLength is 58.38mm. Width at the shaft is 4.76mm and thickness at the same point is 3.83mm. Weight is 5.8g.","fourFigureLat":"52.15707618","fourFigureLon":"-1.7821565","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Eloise Markwick","datefound1":"September 21, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Eloise Markwick","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.83","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weston-on-Avon","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Stratford-on-Avon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/eloisemarkwick/WAW-600E31.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"58.38"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
