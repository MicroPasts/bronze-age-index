Needham 1990). Perhaps the most notable feature of the hoard is the relative paucity of socketed tools compare to ingot (fragments and complete). Complete (or near complete) bun ingots formed part of the Bexley Heath hoard, Essex (Turner 2010, 126-39, no. 15). Other relevant comparanda include the hoard from ‘Burnham on Crouch’, Essex, which contained socketed tools, weapons and fragments of copper alloy ingot (Treasure case 2010 T509), and the hoard from ‘East Colchester’, Essex, which contained socketed tools, complete and fragmentary ingot fragments (Treasure case 2004 T116).  \n\n\n\nBibliography  \n\n\n\nNeedham, S.P. 1990, The Petters Late Bronze Age Metalwork.
