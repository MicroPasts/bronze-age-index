The base would have been semi-circular or similar in outline, and the top edge of a rivet hole remains at the end. A central spine runs down the length of the fragment, with very worn and corroded edges remaining. In section, the blade is lozenge-shaped. While corrosion has undoubtably removed much of the blade, it seems likely that the blade edges has been worn through use in the Bronze Age and probably resharpened. The narrow point remaining on the fragment is probably due to breakage and corrosion of the dirk or rapier in the Bronze Age, with further corrosion in the post-depositional environment.\n\n\nWhile the size of the fragment suggests the object was a dirk, comparison with rapiers from Northumberland indicates that it is only a few mm smaller in width at the shoulders in comparison with complete examples. Thus the possibility that the fragment was from a rapier cannot be dismissed.","fourFigureLat":"55.03352","fourFigureLon":"-1.98589","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lauren Proctor","datefound1":"May 31, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.48","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittington","county":"Northumberland","district":"Northumberland","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/IMG_7490.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"68.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
