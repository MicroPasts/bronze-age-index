The axehead is a Group I (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, distinguished by its shield-shaped decoration below the stop ridge.\n\n\n\nThe butt is H-shaped in section and has some damage to the terminal. The flanges of the butt are wide, and at the end is a pronounched stop-ridge. Beyond this extending onto the blade on both sides is a shield-shaped decoration with a moulded rib that extends from the centre of this and further along the body. The blade is flared and extends to a full crescent.\n\n\n\nBoth narrower sides of the palstave have a moulded rib running down the middle, perhaps indicative of a casting seam. The axe has a reddish patina with extensive areas of green corrosion all over.","fourFigureLat":"52.70795411","fourFigureLon":"0.82580202","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Beeston with Bittering","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LINDA78A7.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
