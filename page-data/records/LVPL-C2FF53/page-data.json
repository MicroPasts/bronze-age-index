The spearhead is almost complete. The head is leaf-shaped and the socket has a pronounced midrib. The mid rib is lozenge shape and extends to the base of the socket where it is slightly facetted rather than raised. The tip of the spearhead is thicker than the rest of the blade and there are re-sharpening marks around the edges of the wings. The edges of the blade has been damaged in most places. The string loops are narrow with oval central piercings. In profile they are oval\n\n(lentoid) having a wider profile than many string looped examples. The base of the socket is broken - probably relatively recently. The socket measures 17.49mm in diameter. The side loops are 24.42mm below the end of the wings and are in good condition. The object is undecorated and had a dark black patina.\n\n\n\nThe blade facets are all lost and it has been plough rolled - probably loosing the tip of the spear as well.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is a string loop type, which suggests later middle Bronze Age to early late Bronze Age date. Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age.\n\n\n\nActon Park II industry.\n\n\n\nA similar example which can be found on the database is LANCUM-7609C0.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Vanessa Oakden","datefound1":"November 01, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Vanessa Oakden","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.91","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Shropshire","district":"","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/voakden/LVPL-C2FF53.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"127"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
