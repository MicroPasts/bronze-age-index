The longer part has a rectangular cross section and extends to a wedge-shaped terminal; the other side is of circular cross section and terminates in a sharp point. The artefact has a smooth, well-developed blue green patina. It is 43mm long, 3.8mm wide and 3.6mm thick. 2.59g. The form of the awl does not change much through time and similar objects are also noted in the Roman period and possibly later, as leather working tools as well as for use on wood.","fourFigureLat":"53.82903324","fourFigureLon":"-0.51251804","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"August 03, 2015","datefound2":"August 03, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishop Burton","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2677_awl.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"43"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
