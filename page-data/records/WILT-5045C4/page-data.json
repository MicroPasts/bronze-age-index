It is triangular in section, the inside surface being a smooth curve from one side to the other while the outside surface has a slight rib running around it.\nIt is 25mm in diameter (internal 12.8mm) and weighs 12.63g.\nAt least seven other examples of triangular-section rings with curved inner edges have been recorded from Wiltshire in the past few years. They are thought to date to the Late Iron Age period and possibly linked to harness. This example is rather chunkier and may date earlier or even slightly later, for example into Roman times.\nCf. WILT-ABDAB1, -0D8803, -A07DA7 for recent examples.","fourFigureLat":"51.150239","fourFigureLon":"-1.929895","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"February 18, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"25","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Berwick St. James","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Rynne Ring.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
