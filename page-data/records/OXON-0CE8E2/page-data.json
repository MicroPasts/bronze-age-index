Below the PMW the blade edges first narrow in a convex arc before abruptly becoming straight diagonal lines to meet the haft of the object. Above the PMW they narrow smoothly in a convex arc to the blades' point. Both blades have irregular chips missing possibly from damage in the soil, although there are at least two (maybe three) V-shaped chips in one blade near the tip of the spear that may be from use or an act of deliberate damage.  The mid-rib  is pronounced, runs the length of the blade and is lozenge shaped in cross section. the blade is flat beyond the midrib with no evidence of a bevel.\n\n\n\nThe socket is circular in cross section with a maximum diameter of 14.3mm at its base. The socket contain concreted soil within it. The spear's has cast side loops placed roughly half way up the socketed end on opposing sides. each loop is c. 10.9mm long, thin (2.0mm wide) and has a sub-oval hole. They do not appear to have been hammered after casting having a stringy appearance. Two casting seem run the length of the socket along lines that include each of the side loops. These are most pronounced between the side loops and blade.\n\n\n\nThe spear has a mostly thick dark green patina that is chipped to reveal a lighter green patina below. There are some lighter bronze scratches possibly from recent damage by the plough.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead is 87.0mm long, 14.3mm thick at the socket narrowing to c.2.3mm thick at the blade tip and weighs 22.31 grams.  \n\n\n\nSide-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis'  (1909) Class IV which they date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Davis (2012) has recently provided a more thorough typology of Bronze Age spearheads in Britain within this typology this form most closely matches his type 6E (leaf shaped) with a point of maximum width placed c. 34% along the blades length and convex blade edges. While the lower blade edge is somewhat angular similar to those seen on Kite shaped spearheads, these may be warped and are illustrated on further leaf shaped spearheads illustrated by Davis (2012: pl. 34, Nos. 570, 584. 587 and 590). Davis (2012: 108-9) argues side looped forms to The Acton Park Phase (1550-1400 cal BC) with the suggestion that in some areas this use may be extended slightly into the Taunton Phase (1400-1250 cal BC).  A date of c. 1550 to 1250 cal BC is most appropriate (following Needham et al. 1997) this would match Needham's (1996) period 5.","fourFigureLat":"51.93736093","fourFigureLon":"-1.01228172","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"April 23, 2021","datefound2":"April 23, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Steeple Claydon","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON0CE8E2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
