The tip is missing, with tapering of the edges suggesting that it would have ended in a point, suggesting approximately 5cms of the original missing. Each edge has damage and corrosion along their lengths. The butt end is corroded and rounded in shape with peripheral damage, it is also thinner in thickness, suggesting that this may have been done deliberately to accommodate the hilt. The blade is very slightly concave in cross section. Part of the original surface survives on one face, and it is possible to make out a regular pattern of stamped dot decoration. This would appear to have originally covered the whole side in a series of triangles, made up of lines of dot decoration coming in from one edge, the areas in between are undecorated and because of that form a series of blank triangular shapes coming in from the opposite edge to complement the decorated ones. The other side in much more heavily pitting with little of the original surface remaining, but it is still possible to discern some stamped dot decoration. There is no evidence of a central rib on either side. See WMID-D54E37.\n\n\n\nLength 173.0mm, Width at butt 39.7mm, Width at tip 13.0mm, Thickness 4.5mm across the mid-section, Thickness across the butt 2.5mm, Weight 108.9g.","fourFigureLat":"53.21792158","fourFigureLon":"-1.82174669","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1500","notes":"\nFound by Aaron B.
