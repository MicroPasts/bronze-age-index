The blade would have been leaf-shaped and has a raised midrib on both sides running from top to bottom. The socket widens towards the end. It has two small side-loops about half way down. These are rectangular and have been cast integrally with the spear. The socket is slightly out of shape with the edge being uneven, however it is mostly circular in section and hollow. Nothing of the wooden shaft remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age.
