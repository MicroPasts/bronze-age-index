This has a subtriangular top half with convex sides that extends into an elongated base that has tapering concave edges. The mouth of the chape is lozenge in form; the long side of the aperture has a deep U-shaped notch in the centre and extended sides that that from two tapering upward projecting arms that would have ran parallel with the scabbard, one arm is truncated. A pronounced central rib runs down the length of both faces and ends at the base where there is an oval disc with chamfered sides. In the centre of the rib is a hole that passes from one side to the next and may have been a rivet hole to secure the chape onto the scabbard.\n\n\n\nThere are small holes over the whole surface which is a defect in the casting process.\n\n\n\nSimilar types of artefacts are recorded on the database at SOMDOR-9ADF54","fourFigureLat":"51.4279168","fourFigureLon":"-2.50481255","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"April 30, 2016","datefound2":"August 31, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hanham Abbots","county":"South Gloucestershire","district":"South Gloucestershire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO7C86FA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"96"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
