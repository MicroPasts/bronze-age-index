The opposite blade end tapers to a rounded and damaged edge in profile which may have expanded outwards to form the cutting edge. The blade is broad and straight sided but as it is worn and incomplete, may have expanded into a more crecentic cutting edge. The surface of the blade is covered with a brown patina and both faces are decorated with straight lines punched into the axe after casting, about 5mm in length, and about 1mm apart, in what is referred to as a 'rain pattern'. One face of the blade has a transverse gash where it has been damaged since deposition, which cuts through the outer layer, revealing the light green corroded surface beneath which is also exposed on parts of the edges. The blade may have been deliberately broken at the upper edge, before it thickens and potentially flanges outwards towards the butt end, as the break is straight and may have been struck with a chisel prior to deposition as it is now corroded and worn.\n\n\n\nComparable examples of decorated flat axeheads with more spaced out linear incisions from the Southwest can be found in Pearce (1983) on a Migdale flat axehead from Southleigh in Devon (pp.455 & 600, pl.39, no.297) and a low-flanged flat axehead from Mount Pleasant in Dorset (pp.468 & 609, pl.48, no.371). See also record CORN-C53643 where the decoration covers the whole axe and is more regular and evenly spaced like this example and the developed flat axehead from Preston Down, Weymouth (pp.487 & 621, pl.60, no.480).\n\n\n\nFlat axes decorated with this 'rain pattern' without flanged sides can be found during the Mile Cross-Aylesford phase (c.2050-1850 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axes illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 124, fig.25, nos.47-48).\n\n\n\nSchmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar flat axeheads with rain patterns from Colleonard Farm, Banffshire, Scotland in pl.16, nos.199 & 202 which are classified as Type Migdale, Decorated Variant, and dated from the Migdale metalworking tradition (c.2200-1950 BC), and a similar concentrated pattern on a developed flat axehead from Middleton-on-the-Wolds, Yorkshire in pl.27, no.310, which is classified as Type Aylesford and dated from the Mile Cross-Aylesford metalwork phase (c.2050-1850 BC) of the Early Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.13817856","fourFigureLon":"-5.40203551","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"September 24, 2018","datefound2":"September 24, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Undergoing further examination at a museum","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"St. Erth","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN6966.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"47"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
