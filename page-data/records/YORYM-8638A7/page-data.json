Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in plan and lozenge in section. The base of the socket can be seen at the broken end of the spear.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark green/brown patina and is worn. The spear is 57.9mm long, 22.7mm wide, 9.7mm thick and weighs 24g.\n\n\n\nAs this object represents only a small fragment of the spearhead it is not possible to classify the form of the complete object with complete confidence. However, the object's apparent lack of a pronounced midrib might be indicative of the 'hollow blade' type, Davis Group 12, and it is this classification which is tentatively suggested.\n\n\n\nSimilar objects have been recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database including NARC-8E2968, IOW-F3883D, and SUR-BB2595.","fourFigureLat":"54.19770712","fourFigureLon":"-2.10879335","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Buckden","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Craven","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/NHY0003.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"57.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
