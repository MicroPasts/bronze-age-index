The blade narrows just below a trapzoidal shaped hilt, becoming parallel-sided, and is bent just before a worn transverse break. The hilt has two rivet holes, of 7.25mm diameter. One of these is incomplete, but the other retains a cylindrical copper alloy rivet, length 13mm by diameter 8.2mm. These rivets would have attached the handle, which would have been of an organic material such as wood or horn.\n\n\n\nBased on the line drawing this fragment has been reidentified as a group IV dirk or rapier, and not a dagger as previously suggested. This allows the dating to be revised to being of either Middle or Late Bronze Age date most probably from the Penard metalworking industry dated to c. 1350 â€“ 1000BC","fourFigureLat":"51.294847","fourFigureLon":"0.479925","fromdate":"-1350","todate":"-1000","notes":"This record has been updated by Peter Reavill (4/5/21) following information provided by Dr Brendan O'Connor.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Andrew Richardson","datefound1":"August 06, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Andrew Richardson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.61","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Aylesford","county":"Kent","district":"Tonbridge and Malling","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/arichardson/PAK150-010.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"81.31"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
