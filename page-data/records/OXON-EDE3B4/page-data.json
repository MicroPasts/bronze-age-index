Only the tip of the spear remains.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is triangular in plan, tapering to the spear's point. It has a lozenge shaped midrib that is solid and runs to the point of the spear from which the flat blade edges of the spear extend these narrow in width to meeting the point. The fragment has a dark green patina that is chipped away in places. \n\n\n\nThe fragment is 24.2mm long, 14mm wide, 8.5mm thick and weighs 5.1 grams.\n\n\n\n Not enough of the spearhead has remained to be able to date this fragment to a more precise range, although the circular section, the angle of the blade, and the midrib extending to the to the tip suggest comparisons with spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.","fourFigureLat":"51.68407164","fourFigureLon":"-0.84422097","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"March 06, 2022","datefound2":"March 06, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bledlow-cum-Saunderton","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Wycombe","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXONEDE3B4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"24.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
