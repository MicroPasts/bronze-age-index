The fragment has slightly concave facets narrowing to the blade and at the apex the suggestion of a mid-ridge. There is no evidence for a socket at the centre. The surface has a dark-green patina, consistent with Bronze Age bronzes.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the copper alloy makes any identification tentative and speculative and it is possible that the fragment is from a more recent object but the form is generally consistent with Bronze Age spearheads.","fourFigureLat":"52.73185388","fourFigureLon":"-2.43089472","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"August 17, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wenke Domscheit","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2014.8.20jpg.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"All rights reserved","length":"20.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
