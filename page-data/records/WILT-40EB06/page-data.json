It is rectangular in form, partly hollow, tapering from an oval mouth to a vertical cutting edge. It does not have the usual loop, instead it has a circular hole through the upper part of the blade itself, perhaps to allow it to be suspended and worn.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 13.2mm in height; 14.1mm in length; 8.5mm thick; 5.1g in weight\n\n\n\nThis resembles Robinson's Type IVa 'Miniature axes with parallel vertical sides - essentially square' (nos. 16-18), although as the edges flare a little it also has some similarity with Type IIb 'miniature axes with an expanding straight sided profile - short stubby axes' (nos. 8 and 9). Robinson does, however, note that no. 9 of Type II can be compared with no. 18 of class IV, and, therefore, Type IV is suggested for this miniature axehead. Similar objects on the database are WILT-669E9D and WILT-B9731D, which both exhibit the same sub-square form as this example.\n\n\n\nThe dating of miniature axeheads is from the late Bronze Age to Roman periods, but they are more common from the Roman period. Robinson dates no.18 to the Roman period, although does not give an explanation for this dating. No. 16, however, was found with a hoard of Bronze Age and Iron Age objects. A wide date range is therefore suggested for this example.\n\n\n\nMiniature socketed axeheads possibly functioned as amulets or votive offerings (Robinson 1995, 60).\n\n\n\nRef:  Robinson, P.
