The axehead has a narrow round-ended butt, which widens slightly down the length of the axehead before widening into a thin crescentic blade with pointed ends. Along the length of the axehead are two raised flanges, which produce a roughly H-shaped cross section. In profile the axehead is a pointed oval shape. The axehead is in good condition with a greeny-brown patina, with some small patches of corrosion ('bronze disease') present. This example is smaller than most other recorded on this database.\n\n\n\nThe axehead measures 74.48 mm long, 40 mm wide (at blade-end), and is 12.8mm thick.
