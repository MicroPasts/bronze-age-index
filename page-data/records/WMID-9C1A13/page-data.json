The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan, with convex expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly damaged, but appears to be symmetrical. The cutting edge measures 49.9 mm&nbsp;in width and is 2.4 mm&nbsp;thick. The blade has a length of 90.0 mm.\n\nIn profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. It measures 25.4 mm&nbsp;in width and 24.5 mm&nbsp;thick at the stop ridge.\n\nThe palstave has a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The septum is 18.2 mm wide. The flanges are complete. At the stop ridge on one face the flange measures 7.2 mm&nbsp;in depth. The butt of the object is complete and measures 22.7&nbsp;mm&nbsp;in width and 3.1&nbsp;thick. It is 66.3 mm long.&nbsp;&nbsp;A side loop is present. It measures 28.9 mm in length, 6.4 mm wide and 4.7 mm thick.&nbsp;\n\nOverall the palstave measures 150.8 mm&nbsp;in length, a maximum width of 49.9&nbsp;mm, and a maximum thickness of 31.6&nbsp;mm. It weighs 412.6&nbsp;g.\n\nThe palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.","fourFigureLat":"52.59774884","fourFigureLon":"-1.89808834","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"The 3D model has been generated using the mobile phone scanning application Qlone.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"31.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Shenstone","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID9C1A13.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"150.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
