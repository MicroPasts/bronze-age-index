The blade has a low flat central spine that runs down the length of both faces; this is flanked by double bevelled sides that create a narrow cutting edge. The cutting edge on both sides is heavily damaged by corrosion resulting the in loss of almost all of their surface area so it is impossible to be certain of the original width. \n","fourFigureLat":"51.536344","fourFigureLon":"-2.36183453","fromdate":"-1800","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"February 01, 2019","datefound2":"April 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sodbury","county":"South Gloucestershire","district":"South Gloucestershire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO87FC3B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"67"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
