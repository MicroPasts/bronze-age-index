The blade was recovered from a riverine deposit. Peter Reavill comments: the classic tell-tale features are the thickened forte (the section by the hilt) that tapers into a very thick sturdy mid-rib - which extends to the point which is almost lozengiform in section. The blades are thought to be for stabbing rather than slashing. The cutting edges are present - but feathered. This blade is snapped below the diagnostic part which is the hilt plate (often trapezoidal) with 2 - 4 rivet holes. The junction between the hilt and upper blade is also lost. I think I would be happiest with attributing it to Burgess / Gerloff's Group III http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/109896- as it seems to have a 'triple arras' - central rib flanked by lesser rib near the cutting edge - possibly Group IV http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/57067 as the outer rib is more rounded and less distinct. Both of these date to the period 1400-1250BC - Needham's period 5. Rapiers are often associated with deposition within running water (streams / rivers) and also static water (bogs).","fourFigureLat":"51.9273384","fourFigureLon":"-0.89615656","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Margaret Broomfield","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.46","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winslow","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Aylesbury Vale","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/margaretb/13-987.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"172.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
