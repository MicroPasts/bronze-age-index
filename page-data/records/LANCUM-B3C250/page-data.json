The axehead is sub triangular in plan with a wide curved blade which tapers to a curved butt and is rectangular in section and there are no signs of a stop ridge. It has a rounded butt and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders. The axe is worn with a flat, rectangular body that gradually tapers towards the butt end and the middle section is missing. Judging from the slightly tapering sides it is probably an earlier flat axe (that is from c. 2400-1700BC) rather than a later one from the Migdale metalworking tradition named after two sites in Scotland. The axe has patches of a brownish patina; the surface is smooth and in good condition. The length of the butt section is 60mm and the width 40mm and the length of the blade section is 90mm and the width 30mm.","fourFigureLat":"53.89186226","fourFigureLon":"-2.27536943","fromdate":"-2400","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"February 05, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to a museum","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Rimington","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM-B3C250.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"90"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
