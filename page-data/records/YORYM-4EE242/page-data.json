Only the cutting edge remains; the fragment is hollow and has a triangular section. The top corner of the cutting edge appears to be flared. Corrosion of the copper-alloy has resulted in a patchy pale green patina and the edges of the axe head fragment are worn and chipped. Unfortunately not enough remains of the axe head to be able to identity it more precisely or attribute a closer date. The length of the fragment is 40.70mm, its width is 22.16mm and the maximum thickness of the fragment is 12.23mm. The weight of the socketed axe head fragment is 23.71g.","fourFigureLat":"54.18479151","fourFigureLon":"-1.02080231","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Miss.
