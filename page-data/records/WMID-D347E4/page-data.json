With only a small part of the septum, butt and some of the side loop missing, the axehead is otherwise complete, even though it is in a very badly corroded state.  The flanges to either side of the septum are very slight (possibly also due to corrosion), as is the stop.  There are remains of one side loop positioned at the stop.  The blade is rather chunky in form without any indentations or ridges beyond the stop.  The blade tip and cutting end only spans slightly.  The general condition of the axehead is poor and corroded with only a few patches of the original dark green patina left near the stop and around the centre of the artefact.\n\nH. N. Savory (in 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections' [National Museum of Wales], 1980, page 46) adds that the transition to the general use of loops to help fastening the handles of axe-heads occurred at about the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1250 BC) in Wales as well as in southern England with influences from the Continent.\n\nThis axehead dates between 1450-700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.912161","fourFigureLon":"-1.748651","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"July 17, 2004","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Boylestone","county":"Derbyshire","district":"Derbyshire Dales","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-D347E4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"108.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
