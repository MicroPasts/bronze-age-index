The centre section of the awl is sub-circular in section with one end of the awl tapering to a sharp point and the other tapering to a thinner rectangular sectioned point, however the very tip is missing. Awls are very difficult to date so a wide range of dates is suggested here, however looking at other finds from the area this is prbably of Middle Bronze Age to Late Iron Age date (c. 1400 BC - AD 43).","fourFigureLat":"51.66143571","fourFigureLon":"-1.4375616","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"43","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"April 01, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"4.8","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017074.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"66.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
