Damage in antiquity leaves the butt end of the axehead incomplete, and active bronze disease has created pitting all over the axehead's surface; areas of the original surface are missing due to this corrosion. The axehead retains most of its shopping blade, which flares out very slowly and slightly from the main body of the axe. The moulding seam is visible down both edges of the axehead but there is no evidence for a loop of any sort. The stop-ridge projects above a shallow channel that retains most of its original surface. This is one of two Bronze Age axeheads recovered from the same field, albeit from opposing ends. The other is recorded as BERK-A83841.","fourFigureLat":"51.373654","fourFigureLon":"-1.426727","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"May 04, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"19.88","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Kintbury","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2011214.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"114.89"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
