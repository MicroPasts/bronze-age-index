Although the axe is flanged there are no stop-ribs evident and therefore the axe is probably transitional in style and date between the winged axes and palstaves. Rowlands MJ; The Production and Distribution of Metalwork in the Middle Bronze Age (1976) BAR 31; cat no 190; plate 25; shows a good example of a short flanged axehead (all cast with no stops) from Little Shelford - Cambs. Similarly, Schmidt and Burgess; The axes of Scotland and Northern England (1981); Nos. 525 and 533. The axe has a mottled green to brown patination and is 151mm long by 70.6mm wide.","fourFigureLat":"51.381766","fourFigureLon":"-1.268564","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1300","notes":"This find was recovered at a Weekend Wanderers one day metal detecting rally held at Crookham, near Thatcham on 11/02/07.
