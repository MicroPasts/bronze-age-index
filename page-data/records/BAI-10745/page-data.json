I have now realised that what I took to be an \"8\" in the weight on an earlier card was actually the \"g\" from the abbreviation for grams. I thought the weight seemed too large at the time (because my putative 8 gave it an extra digit) so I assumed it was \".8\". I commented on it in the Transcriber's Comments at that time. On the plus side, if you can't find that transcription, at least the Weight will be only 0.8 grams out.","composition":"?
