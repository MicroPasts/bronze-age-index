The ring consists of a central core in copper alloy covered by sheets of gold: one on the front and the back of the ring and one on the inner side. This inner sheet is now detached from the core and irregularly folded, whilst the edges of the first sheet on one side are lifted. The gold sheet is decorated on both surface with seven concentric incised lines following the shape of the ring.\n\n\n\nThe ring is C-shaped in plan with a gap of 2.7 mm. It is and triangular in cross-section, with a flat inner side, flat surfaces and a prominent external rim. It is worn with several blackened spots along the sheets of gold.\n\n\n\nThe ring measures 24.9 mm in diameter and weighs 5.01 g.\n\n\n\nGold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) and they could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. They are usually decorated with repousse' decoration or with fine concentric incised lines imitating fine wire works. More rarely, lock-rings are made from plates obtained from individual gold wires soldered together.\n\n\n\nA close parallel is BERK-4A433E (2016 T106) dating to 1150-800 BC. Another similar parallel but without copper alloy core is no.
