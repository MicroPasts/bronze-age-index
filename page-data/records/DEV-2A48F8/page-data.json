It appears truncated, so that a portion of blade and socket are missing. The blade itself is markedly thicker on the upper surface (8.53mm) than the lower surface (2.50mm), but both share the same profile, flaring from the rectangular socket to form a wider cutting edge. There are some signs of unfinished seams on the side surfaces. It is now a greenish patina with a notable area of damage in different places on both sides- diagonally across the blade and at the lower edge of the blade and side piece. \n\n\n\nThe axehead is slightly reminiscent but neater and better produced than no. 176 in Pearce (1983: 431), which she describes as being from the Ashburton area. WILT-A8FADF is a closer example.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 46.5mm length, 43.5mm width, 17.4mm thickness, weight 146g","fourFigureLat":"50.85849592","fourFigureLon":"-2.96749515","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Axminster","county":"Devon","district":"East Devon","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV2A48F8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"46.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
