The butt is damaged but was likely to have been moderately straight (with a width of 21.6mm and a thickness of 6.3mm). The sides from the butt to the stop are near-parallel, gently convex (with a maximum width of 23.8mm). The loop is damaged and extends either side of the stop (with a length of 25.3mm, an internal length of 7mm, a surviving height of 8.7mm and a width of 7.1mm). The septum is rounded and the stops are comparatively flat across both their depths and lengths (with a width of 17.0mm and where the axe has a thickness of 27.7mm). The flanges have a larger degree of damage on one face (with a surviving maximum depth of 25mm and a maximum height of 10.3mm). The flanges are curved and end before the butt, reaching their maximum height before the stop. The casting seams are clearly discernible on both sides and have been finished by hammering. There is the suggestion of subtle nick or ridge at the top of the blade sides and the sides are curved, diverging more sharply towards the blade edge. There is faceting across the thicknesses of the blade. The blade edge has been lost, which was moderately curved and slightly expanded (with a blade width of 44.4mm). The faces are decorated with a trident motif and the edges of the faces are ridged. The midrib and ridged edges both continue as far as the blade facet, producing two concave panels on the faces. The surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright green corrosion. The surface has recently been coated in oil.\n\n\n\nThe palstave is suggested as being of Type Sleaford because of the characteristic panels created between the midrib and flange extensions, this example may be seen as a variant because of the trident decoration. Sleaford palstaves are seen as beginning early in the life of broad blade palstaves with an uncertain longevity (ibid.). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC.\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
