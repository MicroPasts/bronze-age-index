It is missing the top part of the socket and the also the loop. The axe is sub rectangular in plan, with an expanded / flared convex, but abraded cutting edge. The socket is sub rectangular in section. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to the base of socket is 9.8 mm. The break is old and patinated. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. Raised casting seams are present, along both sides, these have been trimmed and hammered flat / finished. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is incomplete. The sides do not appear to be faceted and no ribs are present on either the front or back of the axehead fragment. The axe is most likley to be of a North Wales ribbed type, or faceted axe with a large collar. The axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface. Multiple stratch marks are present on both the front and back of the axehead - these are modern and cut into the patinated surface.\n\n\n\nThe axehead fragment measures 59.8 mm in length, 57.6 mm wide (at the blade edge), 38.3 mm wide (across the remnants of the socket), 20.2 mm thick (at the socket) and 2.2 mm thick (blade). The walls of the axehead range from 5.0 mm to 2.9 mm thick. It weighs 176.1 grams.","fourFigureLat":"52.80173817","fourFigureLon":"-2.81723773","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"August 19, 2013","datefound2":"September 02, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Baschurch","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-B61E05.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"59.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
