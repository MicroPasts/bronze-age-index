It has tapering sides, which extend slightly above the front and back faces of the axe, a flat butt and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders. The cutting edge was crescentric in plan and measures 2.5 mm thick and 52.0 mm wide. The butt is 20.3 mm wide and 3.9 mm thick. The width at the median bevel / proto stop ridge is 30.4 mm and it is 14.9 mm thick. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself.\n\n\n\nIn total the axehead measures 118.3 mm in length, with a maximum width of 52.0 mm and a maximum thickness of 14.9 mm. It weighs 242.2 g.\n\n\n\nThe axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has flaked away from the surface in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green area. These areas should be monitored regularly for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This would be visible as a bright green powdery residue appearing on the surface of the flat axehead. To reduce this risk, the axehead should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.\n\n\n\nThe object can be classified as a developed flat axe most probably an undecorated type Bandon (corresponding to Type Derryniggin in Ireland). These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V), which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. The flat axe probably dates from c.1850-1750 BC.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c. 1750 - 1600 BC.
