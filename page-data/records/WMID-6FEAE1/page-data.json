It is missing the top part of the axehead and the loop.\n\n\nIt is sub rectangular in plan, with an expanded / flared convex, but abraded cutting edge. The socket is sub rectangular in section. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to the base of socket is 10.23 mm. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. No casting seams are visible. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is incomplete. The sides do not appear to be faceted and no ribs are present on either the front or back of the axehead fragment.\n\n\nThe axehead fragment measures 34.34 mm in length, 24.90 mm wide (at the blade edge), 18.69 mm wide (across the remnants of the socket), 7.02 mm thick (at the socket) and 1.39 mm thick (blade). The walls of the axehead are 2.1 mm thick. It weighs 15.2 g.\n\n\nThe axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface.\n\n\nThis socketed axehead fragment is on the small side for the majority of socketed axehead types, but the shape and style is too well made for any of the miniature axehead types that are found in the Wiltshire area (Robinson, 1995). It is more likely to be Late Bronze Age in dating than Late Iron Age to Early Roman. Due to the axe fragment having a slender look to it, it could be similar to the Medreth type axes, possibly a SE type or Medreth, consistent with a Ewart Park assemblage type, of Late Bronze Age dating (Needham Period 7).","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.02","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Alrewas","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-6FEAE1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"34.34"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
