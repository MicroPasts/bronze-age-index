The internal edge is faceted and bears repeating linear striations some of which resemble lettering but this is likely coincidental. \n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark brown delaminate patina with pitting. The ring is 24.1mm in diameter, 3.6mm wide, 4.7mm thick and weighs 4.9g.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer for Herefordshire & Shropshire, comments that parallels with cut marks, incised patterns and inlay for glass are known in later Bronze Age and Iron Age traditions. \n\n\n\nSimilar objects have been recorded on the PAS database as LIN-4F191E and NARC-5B60BD and have also been found in hoards with Bronze Age socketed axes, such as Treasure Case 2014 T442 (YORYM-15AA2D). A number of functions have been suggested including horse harness fittings, cauldron handles or cauldron suspension chains.","fourFigureLat":"54.07945182","fourFigureLon":"-1.40540187","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"24.1","edge":null,"thickness":"4.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Boroughbridge","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Harrogate","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/CF0002.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
