The pin is a derivative of a Picardy-type pin and dates to c1400-1250BC. The pin is now bent but is complete and, if straight, measures 180mm. The surfaces are now mainly dark brown and there are iron-rich surface deposits, especially underneath the head of the pin. The disc-shaped head is 23.70mm in diameter and has a prominent rim on its upper face. The face of the disc is left rough and gives the impression there was an inlay made from a different material. Less than midway along the shaft is a prominent projection in the form of an elongated diamond which is pierced by a transverse hole now filled with corrosion products. Surface damage to the projection reveals a bright yellow metal.\n\n\n\nBetween this projection and the sloping base of the head the shaft is extensively decorated. The decoration comprises three, or more probably four, bands of (4 or 5) encircling grooves. Between each group of encircling grooves the shaft is covered with bands of alternating diagonal hatching.\n\n\n\nPicardy type pins are dated from the early Taunton phase of the Bronze Age and according to the most recent interpretations probably go out of use by the Renard phase, giving a date range of between c.1400 and 1250 BC (Roberts, 2007: 141). These pins are still very rare along the Atlantic seabord although there are two others known from Suffolk and at least one from Norfolk, but in general they seem confined to southern and south-eastern Britain.","fourFigureLat":"51.70699339","fourFigureLon":"-1.58171638","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1250","notes":"See SF-509598 for the head of a similar pin and further comment.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"June 20, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"23.7","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Clanfield","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF9553.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Berkshire Archaeology","length":"180"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
