The ends are broken and ragged and there are a number of tears and folds along the body of the strip.\n\nDimensions: \n\nLength: 32mm\n\nWidth: 9mm\n\nWeight: 1.52g\n\nGold content: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip by the British Museum Scientific Research team indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-88% gold, 11-12% silver, the rest being copper (1-2%). See appended report. \n\nDiscussion: Similar grooved, pierced gold ribbons are well known, examples include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5); 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97.\n\nThe incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and &#39;ribbons&#39; of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).","fourFigureLat":"52.09840006","fourFigureLon":"-0.92113717","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\nAuthor: Neil Wilkin &ndash; Curator, The British Museum","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"","datefound1":"November 12, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"0.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grafton Regis","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUC1DF5C4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"31.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
