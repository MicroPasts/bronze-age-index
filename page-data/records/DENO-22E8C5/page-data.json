The axe head comprises a curved, fan shaped cutting edge, which has suffered damage and corrosion. This tapers back in a curve to the stop ridge, before levelling out to form the rest of the axe. There is a prominent vertical rib running down the centre of the blade on both faces, from the stop ridge, to within approximately 20mm from the blade's edge, this is mirrored by two slighter ribs running either side, along the blades edges. Casting seams are visible along both sides of the axe head. Just below the stop ridge are traces of where the loop would have been situated. Below the stop ridges, on either side, are very slight flanges, which taper and then disappear towards the butt of the object. The area between these flanges is slightly curved in profile, with trace of an unidentied material on one side. Areas of the axe head are delaminating, with flaking on parts of the surface.","fourFigureLat":"52.86685713","fourFigureLon":"-1.61521988","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1000","notes":"\nThis object has been treated by the finder, by coating in olive oil.
