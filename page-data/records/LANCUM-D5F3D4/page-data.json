The axe is probably a Faceted Axe, type Gillespie sometimes known as 'baggy axe'. These axes have been discovered in associated with the late Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase XI) and the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-700 CAL. BC.\n\n\n\nIt is trapezoidal in shape and has a narrowed, triangular profile. The axe fragment consists of the lower portion of the axe that contain the slightly expanded cutting edge and the sides up to an old break just above the socket aperture to where the core of the mould would have ended. The remains of the socket are sub-rectangular in shape. There is no decoration visible on the surface. The axe was discovered on a small intertidal island and is very corroded and stained by salt water with a whitish-brown patina.\n\nThe length is 43mm, the width is 50mm and the weight 84.15g.\n\n\n\nThe length is 43mm, the width is 50mm and the weight 84.15g.","fourFigureLat":"54.10133053","fourFigureLon":"-3.25549763","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"September 03, 2017","datefound2":"September 03, 2017","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walney North","county":"Cumbria","district":"Barrow-in-Furness","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMD5F3D4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"43"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
