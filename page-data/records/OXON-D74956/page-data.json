The object is slightly bent and sub-rectangular in cross section.  The blunt end gradually thickens along the tang to a wider mid-section 4.3mm in diameter before tapering to a point.  Found with a second, smaller complete copper alloy awl (OXON-D77AEC).\n\n\n\nThe awl is 58.2mm in length, 4.3mm at the widest section and 1.5mm in diameter at the blunt end.  It weighs: 3.9 grams.\n\n\n\nAwls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Referred to as \"pointed punches\" by Coles (1963-64 117). Plain awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).
