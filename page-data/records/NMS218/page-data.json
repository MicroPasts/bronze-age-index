Smooth and shiny browny-green patina with several large pitted holes in the surface. Point intact and sharp. The break is rough and therefore probably quite recent and pointed oval in section. It is unclear how long the dirk would have been as the narrowing towards the break could be just wear, though the narrowness suggests this was probably not a lot longer and therefore a dirk rather than a rapier.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"This record was created before the Portable Antiquities Scheme began using the Central Database.
