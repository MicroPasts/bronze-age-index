The blade is of lozenge section at the break (where it has a width of 17.2mm and a thickness of 3.6mm) and there is the suggestion of a central rib on one face. One of the blade edges is straight and the other is convex, probably as a result of erosion or wear. There is slight distortion along the length of the fragment. The surface of the blade is heavily-pitted with a dark green patina.\n\n\nThe blade would appear to be a little too substantial for a dagger, while being too slight for a sword.","fourFigureLat":"51.688175","fourFigureLon":"-2.608965","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 25, 2009","datefound2":"July 09, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Woolaston","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Forest of Dean","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2009.154.1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"53.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
