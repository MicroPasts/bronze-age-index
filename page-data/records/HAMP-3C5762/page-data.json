This example is from the earliest bronze working traditions, dating from the centuries after c. 2000 BC. The blade terminates in a rounded, but asymmetrical cutting edge. The terminals are almost right angles but have been rounded off. Bevelling to create the edge is very shallow, beginning well above the line of the terminals. The object continues to expand to the point of an old break.  At this point the rectangular cross-section can clearly be seen; no side flanges are evident. The axe has a variable dark-green patina with extensive lighter pitting and invasive corrosion.","fourFigureLat":"51.010885","fourFigureLon":"-0.975068","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"June 01, 2009","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.85","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Steep","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-3C5762axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
