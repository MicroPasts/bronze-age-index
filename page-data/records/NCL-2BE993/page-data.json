The blade flares out from the body with an even curviture to the edge.  The edge remains fairly sharp, though an imperfection in the metal has left a small semicircular divet in the center of the edge.  At the points of the blade, the width of the axe is 60mm.\n\nThe haft end is roughly squared, and it is difficult to tell whether this is the original butt or if butt broke off the object, the broken edges then smoothed slightly.  The butt measures 27mm in width.\n\nThe surface of the axe has an even grey-green patina, though where pitting occurs (always less than 1.5mm in diameter) the color is a light tinted green.  There are also patches of iron oxidation that seem to be integral to the object.  Thus, it seems to be made from a ferrous copper alloy.","fourFigureLat":"54.213587","fourFigureLon":"-1.280805","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Robert Collins","datefound1":"March 31, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Robert Collins","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bagby","county":"North Yorkshire","district":"Hambleton","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/Thompson axe comp.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"78"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
