The spearhead socket is broadly an elongated sub-triangular in plan and profile with a leaf-shaped blade. The socket is almost complete and is circular at the base and tapers towards the blade. At the lower edge of the socket, on the exterior the surface is slightly off-set, therefore the external diameter of the socket becomes slightly smaller.\n\n\n\nOn the exterior edge of the socket, on either side, there is an integral loop which has oval perforations. A trace of a casting seam is visible on one side of the socket only.\n\n\n\nThe blade of the spear is leaf-shaped which has a pronounced midrib on both faces. One midrib has a slight recent scrape revealing fresh metal. The edges of the blade are slightly abraded thereby losing some of their cutting edge. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the spearhead has an incomplete mid brown patina, which is lighter on the blade than the socket.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead measures 148.87mm in length, has a maximum width (across the blade) 25.78mm and maximum thickness of 17.76mm (across the socket). The depth of the socket is not know as still partially filled with soil. With the soil insert, the spearhead weighs 56.49g. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.\n\n\n\nSimilar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards which was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC.\n\n\n\nThe loops on socketed spearheads would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.","fourFigureLat":"52.76525057","fourFigureLon":"-2.89065704","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"See also Davis Group 6 (2017: 2).","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2019","datefound2":"May 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"17.76","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Little Ness","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWC9E8FD.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"148.87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
