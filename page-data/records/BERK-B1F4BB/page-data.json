The palstave is in good condition with minimal pitting and only slight wear to the blade edge. There appears to be an old break to the butt end but otherwise the palstave is in very good condition. There is a pronounced casting seam down the centre of the flanges and there is a hollow below the stop ridge on both sides of the object. There are two small 'V' shaped marks just below the stop ridge but restricted to one side of the object - this appears to have occured during casting. The blade measures 49.9mm wide, is complete and has a crescentic plan with short curved tips. The blade facet is not visible. The axe is of Middle Bronze Age date (1500 - 1300 BC) and is most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.","fourFigureLat":"51.4351403","fourFigureLon":"-1.18139612","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"August 09, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stanford Dingley","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2016490.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"123.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
