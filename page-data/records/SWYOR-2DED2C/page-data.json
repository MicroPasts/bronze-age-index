Only the blade end of the object survives. The cutting edge is 37mm wide and the sides then taper to 22.2mm wide at the break, where it is 20.4mm thick and a rounded rectangle in cross-section. No evidence of the side flages or stop ridge survive making the object hard to classify and date confidently.\n\n\n\nThe narrowness of the blade and thickness at the break are perhaps more similar to chisels such as NMS-894E92, SF2649 and SOMDOR-7B3C43 on this database, but it does not seem to have the horizontal sides of the more common chisel form, as seen on SF-09D1D5 and SUSS-D93644 on this database. However, small, narrow-bladed palstaves belonging to the Taunton phase (1400-1300 BC) of metalworking or possibly to the slightly earlier Acton Park II period, (c.1500-1400 BC); (both corresponding with Needham's period 5, 1500 - 1150 CAL BC) are also similar, especially in the rapid thickening from blade to break. It was perhaps similar to SOM-1DE687, HAMP-996311 or the axeheads in GLO-6535E4. Further arguments on either side are given in SOM-2B70A5.\n\n\n\nThe tool is 60.4mm long, 36.7mm wide and 20.4mm thick. 136g.","fourFigureLat":"53.39792644","fourFigureLon":"-0.5426346","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Amy Downes","datefound1":"January 25, 2015","datefound2":"January 25, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Amy Downes","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"20.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bishop Norton","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2479_BA.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service","length":"60.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
