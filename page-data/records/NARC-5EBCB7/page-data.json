The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan from the butt to the stop, and subtriangular in profile, with the thickest part of the artefact immediately behind the stop ridge. The flange facets give the artefact a lozengiform profile, and are fused to the stop ridge, thus forming two raised elements with which to haft the axe. The butt of the axehead is slightly rounded in plan. The blade is subtriangular in plan and subrectangular in section. The artefact is in a stable condition, with a patchy dark green patina. Similar examples are illustrated in Moore, C, N & Rowlands, M, 1972, 'Bronze Age Metalwork in Salisbury Museum', pages 52-3 & plate VII, ref nos 15-22.","fourFigureLat":"52.172428","fourFigureLon":"-1.182559","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Steven Ashby","datefound1":"March 15, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Steven Ashby","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26.43","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Preston Capes","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sashby/NARC-5EBCB7  nl ba axe.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"159"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
