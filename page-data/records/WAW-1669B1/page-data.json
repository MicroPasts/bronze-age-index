The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval/leaf-shaped blade, with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces. The mid-rib is lozenge shaped and tapers from the tip of the spearhead into the socket of the spear. The socket is hollow and has cast side loops roughly half way up the socketed end on opposing sides. The socketed end is slightly chipped but overall the object shows few signs of wear. The object has a smooth dark brown to dark green patina, which is pitted in places.\n\n\n\nThis form of spearhead can be classified as Davis Group 6 (Davis 2017). Davis (2017) suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He thus dates these types to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, circa 1550-1250 BC. As such this example has been similarly dated. \n\n\n\nComparable objects recorded on the PAS database include: SWYOR-A609BB; LIN-0DDC06; and LANCUM-D63A53.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 109mm in length, 19mm in width and 14mm in depth.","fourFigureLat":"52.12977927","fourFigureLon":"-2.35201698","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"Photographs and dimensions kindly supplied by the finder during the third Covid-19 lockdown period.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Malvern","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Malvern Hills","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sburford/WAW1669B1.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"109"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
