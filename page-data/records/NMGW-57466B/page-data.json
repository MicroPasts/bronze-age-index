The fragment comprises the narrow butt of the axehead, which is sub-rectangular in plan (overall length 32.6mm) and sub-triangular in profile that thins to the edge of the butt. The sides are straight and only slightly divergent (width at butt is 17.1mm, width at break is 20mm). The object is convex across the thickness beginning c.10mm from the butt edge and increasing gradually, reaching the maximum thickness (8.7mm at the edges, 6.2mm at the centre between the flanges) at the break (which occurred in old damage). The butt is narrow and thin with a surviving thickness of c.0.7mm. The surface is a dark green patina mottled with patches of bright green corrosion and weighs 20.44g.\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The gradual flange suggests the fragment is likely a developed flat axe rather than a palstave, which have a more dramatic flange at the butt.","fourFigureLat":"51.49758573","fourFigureLon":"-3.70128439","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adelle Bricking","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Porthcawl","county":"Bridgend","district":"Bridgend","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/202233.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"32.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
