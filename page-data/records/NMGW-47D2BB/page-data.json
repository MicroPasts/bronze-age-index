Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B \n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.\n\n\n\nThis is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.\n\n\n\n2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragment\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.\n\n\n\nThis is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.\n\n\n\nFragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.\n\n\n\n3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.\n\n\n\nThis is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.\n\n\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n\n\n4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)\n\n\n\nDimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.\n\n\n\nThis is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.\n\n\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n\n\n5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D \n\n\n\nDimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.\n\n\n\nThis is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.\n\n\n\nThe sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.\n\n\n\nThe molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).\n\n\n\nThe axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.\n\n\n\n6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.\n\n\n\nThese are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. \n\n\n\nThe socket end (visible on fragments 6 & 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.\n\n\n\nFragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,\n\n\n\nwith a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.\n\n\n\nAll fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.\n\n\n\n9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.\n\n\n\nThis is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.\n\n\n\nThere is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n\n\n10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.\n\n\n\nThis is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.\n\n\n\nThe spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.\n\n\n\n11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable sword\n\n\n\nDimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.\n\n\n\nThis is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.\n\n\n\nThe breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.\n\n\n\n12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner form\n\n\n\nDimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.\n\n\n\nThis is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.\n\n\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n\n\n13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner form\n\n\n\nDimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. \n\n\n\nThis a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.\n\n\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n\n\n14. Copper alloy annular ring\n\n\n\nDimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.\n\n\n\nThis is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.\n\n\n\nThe ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n\n\n15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning cap\n\n\n\nDimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.\n\n\n\nThis is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.\n\n\n\nThe object is covered in a dark green patina.\n\n\n\nThis object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. \n\n\n\n16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slag\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.\n\n\n\nThis is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.\n\n\n\nThis piece is covered in green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThis slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards.","fourFigureLat":"51.91556676","fourFigureLon":"-3.36808188","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"Bibliography\n\n\n\nAudouze, F. & Courtois, J.-C.
