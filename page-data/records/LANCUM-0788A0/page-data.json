They date from 1000 to 800BC. Associated with LANCUM-06AA41, LANCUM-0633E7,  LANCUM-060825.jpg, LANCUM-064172 and LANCUM-069462\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n1. Chisel: The chisel is virtually complete and in good condition. The tang of the chisel is tapering and rectangular sectioned square-sectioned. There is a wide, oval collar separating the tang from the blade. The blade is oval in cross section below the collar and flares and thins in to a triangular shape with a fine convex cutting edge.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 98mm; Width: 30mm; Thickness: 6mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 34.75g\n\n\n\n2. Tanged Dagger or Knife: Incomplete. The blade is double edged, tapering, with a central ridge producing a lozenge form profile, the top is broken and may have originally terminated in a tang. The blade is narrowed from the top of the blade with angled sides and has breaks at both ends.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Surviving length: 50mm; Width: 15mm; Thickness: 2mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 14.39g\n\n\n\n3. Fragment of copper alloy slag\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 43mm; Width: 23mm; Thickness: 18mm\n\n\n\nWeight: 34.47g\n\n\n\n4. Fragment of copper alloy slag\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length: 22mm; Width: 12mm; Thickness: 8mm.\n\n\n\nWeight: 11g\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nThe tanged chisel (1) has other parallels in the database such as a tanged chisel from South Oxfordshire (Byard 2012) (BERK-52E8C3) and one other from Winfrith Newburgh, Dorset (Hayward Trevarthen 2012) (DOR-F18347). Tanged chisels have been found in several Bronze Age hoards and have a wide distribution in Britain and Ireland.\n\n\n\nBurgess and Gerloff (1981, 36ff) include a blade of similar shape and size to the tanged dagger or knife from Bolton-Le-Sands (2) in their Group II ('Damaged Blades Modified for Rehafting'). It is similar to an example from Marston Trussel, Northamptonshire (Ibid, no.248), described as: \"[A t]anged blade, either a knife made in this form or possibly a dirk with butt cut down for rehafting, in which case the torn rivet hole would have been secondary.\" (Ibid., pl. 32, no 248). It is also similar to two others on the Portable Antiquity Scheme database. One a cast tanged knife found in Dorset (DOR-FAC625) and the other an incomplete knife found in Wiltshire (WILT-83A428).\n\n\n\nBoth finds (1-2) can be dated on typological ground to the Late Bronze Age Wilburton and Ewart Park phases, c.1000-850 BC. Metalworking waste (3-4) is a common feature of Late Bronze Age hoards and finds.\n\n\n\nThe four objects (1-4) appear to have been associated and represent a single find.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIn terms of their age and grouping of more than two items, this find qualifies as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage and so as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure (Designation) Order 2002.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nByard, A (2012) BERK-52E8C3 A BRONZE AGE CHISEL Webpage available at: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/488005 [Accessed: 8 May 2013 18:16:30]\n\n\n\nBurgess, C.
