The axe is incomplete, missing large parts of the mouth moulding, the side loop, the entire blade edge, and any potential blade tips. This lack of key diagnostic features makes it hard to place this axe into a typology, but it shows similarities to the South Eastern Type.\n\nThe mouth moulding is a simple raised band c. 10mm wide in its surviving areas. The mouth is 28.2mm thick at the mouth moulding and 33.3mm wide, with internal dimensions of 24.65mm wide and 19.8mm wide. Most of the mouth moulding has delaminated from the metallic core and is lost, so the external measurements are incomplete. This loss of material makes the external profile of the mouth hard to judge, but seems to have been angular, potentially sub rectangular. The internal mouth profile is uneven and somewhat rectangular. Both faces are undecorated and smooth.\n\nThe loop sprang from the bottom of the mouth moulding, and had a length of c. 19mm, now only surviving as indistinct attachment scars. The sides of the axe are very slightly concave, and can be seen to start to expand just before the sides end at the break where the blade has detached. The width at the point of the break is 31mm. A surviving core of the blade, including the original surface of one face, projects below this point but gives little clue to the blade&rsquo;s original form or dimensions, being largely a metallic core covered in powdery blue copper alloy corrosion. Both of the sides have prominent casting seams/flashings running from the mouth moulding to the break.\n\nThe axe retains most of its original surface, which has an uneven green to brown patina. The broken areas are covered by active baby blue powdery copper alloy corrosion. \n\nWhile this axe is difficult to firmly place as a South Eastern type axe, it certainly shows typological affinities to examples such as No. 1300 in Schmidt &amp; Burgess (1981). Mark Lodwick comments: South Eastern type axes are often associated with the Carp&#39;s Tongue complex of North West France (Schmidt &amp; Burgess, 1981, p 217), which heavily influences hoard composition in Lowland England. The type is also well represented throughout Britain and is present in the Llantwit tradition of south east Wales, represented within the eponymous hoard and elsewhere.\n\nLength: 68mm\n\nWidth: 33.3\n\nThickness: 28.2mm at collar, 24mm below\n\nMouth dimensions: Width: 24.65mm Depth: 19.8mm\n\nBlade expansion maximum: 31mm \n\nWeight: 94.11g","fourFigureLat":"51.52820247","fourFigureLon":"-3.42851665","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"George Whatley","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"28.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llanharry","county":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","district":"Rhondda Cynon Taf","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2021511.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"68"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
