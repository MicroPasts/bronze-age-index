The fragment has lost all its diagnostic features and so the classification cannot be further refined. The fragment consists of the body of the blade with a pronounced circular midrib ridge which narrows either side to form the blade. The ridge measures 9.8mm in width and 10.2mm in thickness. The edges of the blade are worn and broken, and it is unclear what the shape the original blade would have been. The piece is lozenge in cross section and has a shiny green patina. The fragment is 25.6mm in width, 18.1mm in length, and is 2.3mm thick. The fragment weighs 9.76g.","fourFigureLat":"51.74656096","fourFigureLon":"-0.79917168","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Arwen Wood","datefound1":"May 16, 2016","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Arwen Wood","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ellesborough","county":"Buckinghamshire","district":"Wycombe","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ajames/BUCCE327F.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"18.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
