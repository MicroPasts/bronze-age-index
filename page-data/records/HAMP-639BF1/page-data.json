This flanged example is characteristic of the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage. The blade terminates in a rounded cutting edge. The terminals are either both abraded or were truncated originally. Bevelling to create the edge is shallow, beginning just below the line of the terminals. The flanged sides give the artefact a pointed oval cross section. They feature low flange facets in profile. They are up to 7.2mm thick, and rise up slightly above the septum at the crests. The curved butt is rounded and slightly abraded (W.: c. 9.5mm). The axe has corroded to a light brown-green colour with some pitting.\n\nGiven the existence of miniature votive objects in the Roman period a later date is not ruled out entirely, although it is considered unlikely given the size and metal of this example.","fourFigureLat":"50.969692","fourFigureLon":"-1.588369","fromdate":"-1700","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"April 30, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wellow","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley/HAMP-639BF1axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museum Service","length":"53.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
