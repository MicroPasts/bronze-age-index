It is likely to be from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould.\n\n\n\nThe object has an irregular sub-circular dished plate with the remains of two curved ovate jets projecting from one side. Both jets taper to faceted terminals which suggest they were cut transversely. A seam extends between the two jets.\n\n\n\nThe upper surface of the dished plate is pitted and rough. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. \n\n\n\nThe metal has a dark brown patina and is worn. The object is 18.8mm long, 16.7mm wide, 3.4mm thick (11.1mm thick including jets) and weighs 4.9g.\n\n\n\nDue to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from the Iron Age to Medieval period (c. 800 BC - AD 1500). Casting waste is difficult to date in isolation but the patina and form are suggestive of a Bronze Age - Roman date. The survival of casting waste in this period is relatively rare as it is usually recycled as a bi-product of casting.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples on the PAS database include LVPL-F7963B, LVPL-3AAD50 and HESH-B55DB1.","fourFigureLat":"53.9252217","fourFigureLon":"-1.16394262","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"350","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Askham Bryan","county":"York","district":"York","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/DSY0499.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"18.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
