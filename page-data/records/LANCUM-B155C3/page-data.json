The axe is narrow with straight but tapering sides and there are no signs of a stop ridge. The sides of the axe are very slightly thickened, but it does not have flanges.\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark green in colour with a heavily pitted and corroded patina.\n\n\n\nThe axe probably fits into the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC, or slightly later.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples can be seen on the Portable Antiquities Database: SWYOR-9EC7C9 WAW-049216, LANCUM-E3C336 and SUR-25F712.\n\n\n\nThe length is 68mm, the width is 28mm thickness 8mm and the weight 50.21g.","fourFigureLat":"53.72861411","fourFigureLon":"-2.65322386","fromdate":"-2350","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"August 03, 2016","datefound2":"August 03, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Coupe Green and Gregson Lane","county":"Lancashire","district":"South Ribble","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMB155C3.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"68"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
