In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib, with multiple abrasions and missing portions along the edges. The fragment terminates in an old abraded, irregular transverse break, across the socket. The metal is pitted and corroded.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: length:43.87mm, width: 10.66mm, thickness: 7.48mm, weight.18g.\n\n\n\nAs this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1500-c. 800 cal BC).\n\n\n\nSimilar objects can be found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database: NLM-99D791, IOW-F3883D, SUR-BB2595","fourFigureLat":"51.03959961","fourFigureLon":"1.00838731","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mags Erwin","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mags Erwin","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.48","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Dymchurch","county":"Kent","district":"Shepway","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smokedkelpie/KENT5CC997.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"43.87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
