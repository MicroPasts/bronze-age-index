The fragment consists of the blade end of a socketed axe, 44.5 mm long, 29.5 mm wide at the blade end, 15 mm in height and 4 mm thick at the broken end, and 41.35 g in weight. The entire surface is oxidized to a pale green. The base of the sub-rectangular socket is slightly dished and would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe.The almost parallel sides of the fragment are slightly convex, with a faint linear casting seam on each side. The blade is very slightly expanded from the sides of the axe at the cutting edge, which would have been the result of sharpening during use. The cutting edge is rounded and slightly damaged although this appears to be limited to the surface corrosion and is more likely the result of soil movement than of use. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar Armorican socketed axes from Newlyn and Carn Brea, in Cornwall, on pages 421 & 424, plates 14 & 17, nos.115 & 129c.","fourFigureLat":"50.60300985","fourFigureLon":"-4.44608582","fromdate":"-800","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"April 07, 2018","datefound2":"April 07, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"15","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lewannick","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN6641.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"44.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
