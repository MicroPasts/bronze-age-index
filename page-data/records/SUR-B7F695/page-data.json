Probably part of the later Penard or Wilburton metalwork assemblage. The fragment retains a wide lenticular midrib and the edges of two rivet holes and is slightly tapering in plan view. The blade remains sharp. Due to the midrib running all the way along the entire length of the blade it is likely that this is a reworked rapier or dirk blade, possibly made of a broken blade fragment. It can be classed as one of Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group IV: Damaged weapons with reworked butts, e.g. nos. 900-950 (Burgess and Gerloff 1981). These probably date slightly later than the original weapons, so a date in the later Middle Bronze Age or earlier Late Bronze Age seem feasible.","fourFigureLat":"51.24690047","fourFigureLon":"-1.27070479","fromdate":"-1200","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Margaret Broomfield","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.43","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Overton","county":"Hampshire","district":"Basingstoke and Deane","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/B1669.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"33.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
