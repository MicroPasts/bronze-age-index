The axe is broken at the butt but is otherwise complete with casting flashes that have been filed but are still slightly raised on the sides. It is part of the Taunton metalwork assemblage. The axe has two triangular flanges (diamond-shaped from the side) and with its small, worn semi-circular stop-ridge it could be related to the shield-pattern palstaves of the Acton Park metalwork assemblage to which it bears some resemblance. The axe is a heavy implement and complete with the two flanges and a crescent-shaped blade with up-turned corners. It has a dull brown patina. The axe is pitted and corroded therefore it is difficult to tell if there are any sharpening marks.\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar, less complete palstave was recorded here: LANCUM-F8B182\n\n\n\nThe length is 142mm, width is of blade is 67mm, thickness is 35mm","fourFigureLat":"53.89141654","fourFigureLon":"-2.42752353","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"December 22, 2016","datefound2":"December 22, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"35","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Waddington","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM16229D.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"142"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
