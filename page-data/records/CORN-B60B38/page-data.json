The core of the sherd has been oxidised to a light brown colour and the exterior and interior surfaces to a more orangey-brown colour. The exterior surface has been sooted and still has carbonised remains extant. The fabric looks, from microscopic investigation, to have mica, white feldspar, quartz sands and killas inclusions, which is typical of the local beaker wares made during the Early Bronze Age in Cornwall. Comparable beaker vessels with similar inclusions (Parker Pearson, 1990, p.11) and decoration have been found at sites in Penwith, such as Trevedra and Praa Sands, illustrated in Clarke's corpus, 1970, pp.378-9, Nos.814 & 820.
