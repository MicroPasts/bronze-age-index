One end of the blade apparently tapers into a tang which is now largely missing. The blade is in poor condition, its tip is bent and its edges are badly damaged and notched. This damage makes it difficult to evaluate whether the apparent tang is a genuine feature or simply a fortuitous break. The blade may possibly be an example of a rare type of Early to Middle Bronze Age knife known as a Class I or 'plantain razor' (Piggott 1946, 122-126, fig.5). The term 'razor' is a slight misnomer as these artefacts were almost certainly not used specifically for shaving but were rather some form of cutting tool. Unfortunately, the tang is the most diagnostic part of this artefact type and without it a positive identification is difficult.","fourFigureLat":"51.490164","fourFigureLon":"-1.353251","fromdate":"-2500","todate":"-700","notes":"This record was created before the Portable Antiquities Scheme began using the Central Database.
