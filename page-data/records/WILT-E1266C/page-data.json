This fragment comprises of the upper socket, circular in cross section and tapering towards the point, now lost, and with the wings of the blade projecting from either side. These are relatively flat in cross section, with the more complete tapering to a point at the edge. In plan the wings appear to have been relatively elongated, with a rounded base, although they are too incomplete to be certain of their form.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 34.1mm; width 25.8mm; thickness 12.6mm; weight 12.1g.\n\n\n\nThe fragment fits with another (see: WILT-E14BAE), although the relative condition of the fragments and breaks would suggest that the breaks are due to more recent damage, rather than anything prior to or during deposition; thus, the fragments are not likely to constitute a hoard and do not qualify as treasure under the terms of the treasure act of 1996. The spear head fits into Davies' (2012, in 2017) Group 6, which he suggests accounts for almost half of EBA/MBA spear heads found in Britain and dates to the Acton Park and Taunton metal working phases.","fourFigureLat":"51.10528443","fourFigureLon":"-2.05851037","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chilmark","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridge/WILTE1266C.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"34.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
