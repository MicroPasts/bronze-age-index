The break occurred in antiquity and there is no socket base evident on the sub-rectangular body section. The surviving side fragment is convex, widening to the blade tip, now truncated but indicating an expanded blade edge. The original blade edge has been lost but the current edge suggests a moderate curve (with a depth of approximately 14mm). The side is widest at the edges, possibly as a result of hammering. The blade faces have a slight convexity across both their widths and lengths but with no obvious blade facet. The original surface has been lost and the current surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-green to brown patina.\n\n\n\nThe fragment condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The lack of a socket base and wider expansion that might be expected on a socketed axe may suggest a flat, developed or palstave axe, suggesting an Early to Middle Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"51.65189831","fourFigureLon":"-2.66629675","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.7","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tidenham","county":"Gloucestershire","district":"Forest of Dean","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20172481new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"31.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
