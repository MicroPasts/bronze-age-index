This fragment is subsquare in plan and a flattened lentoid in section. There is no median rib or ridge. It is 31.26mm long, 37.54mm wide, 5.18mm thick and weighs 28.08g. The two cutting edges and one has a significant nick to one corner. The break edges are regular and worn. This might suggest that the blade was deliberately cut in antiquity, perhaps for inclusion in a scrap or ‘founders’ hoard. Some of the original surface survives with a mid green patina, but the mostly exposed lower surface is light green. There is a significant patch of brown corrosion to one side.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.18","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Hatfield Broad Oak","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/moss blade frag.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"31.26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
