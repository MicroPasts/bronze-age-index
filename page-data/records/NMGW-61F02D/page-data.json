The cutting edge of the blade is very slightly concave in plan with rounded ends that slope from a slightly convex top edge. The overall length is 69.2mm and max width is 25.4mm. An irrelgular long notch (11.8mm long by 3.5mm thick) along the top edge may be the point at which a tang or hafted handle had attached, but is now missing in old damage. The notch is off-centre measuring 32.2mm from one end, 39.2mm from the other. (A similar notch is seen on NMGW-B18276). The blade is thickest at the centre (5.3mm thick) and thins to the edges, except at the irregular notch. The opposite face is mostly flat with a slight taper towards the cutting edge and a few striations run along the blade, possibly from sharpening. \n\n\n\nThe object weighs 30.06g and the metal is smooth with a mid-green patina. Patches of black possible tenorite coating preserves the top edge. The reverse has some spots of bright green bronze corrosion. \n\n\n\nA similar razor is recorded on the PAS database, NMGW-B18276, which was also found in Caerwent and also treated with a black coating with a similar notch at the top edge.","fourFigureLat":"51.63329965","fourFigureLon":"-2.7671643","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adelle Bricking","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adelle Bricking","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Caerwent","county":"Monmouthshire","district":"Monmouthshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/202299.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"69.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
