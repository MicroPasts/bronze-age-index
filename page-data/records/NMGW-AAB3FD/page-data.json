The butt end is damaged and jagged but may have been rounded and thins to the edge (with a width of 20mm and a thickness of 1.8mm). The sides are near-straight and divergent for their short lengths to the break (with a maximum width of 27.7mm and a thickness across the septum of 8.1mm). The sides are rounded and convex across their thicknesses, with the suggestion of a casting seam on the heavily-corroded and pitted surface. The flanges begin just below the butt and are have a linear divergent edge (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 12.8mm with a maximum height above the septum of 2.5mm). The break occurred in antiquity. The surface has a bright and green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with slender-butted Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981) from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"51.5010603","fourFigureLon":"-3.44207509","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"May 15, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"12.8","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2015122.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Mark Lodwick","length":"30.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
