The mouth is rounded (6.5mm thick and 8mm long) with no casting runner stubs present on the mouth.  Beneath the collar is a horizontal moulding on the mouth and side. The face (with a thickness of 4mm) has the top of two of the three ribs descending from the moulding and continuing to the break. The face is flat across its width and its length, beneath the collar. The side has a slight angle, perhaps suggesting a hexagonal body section on the axe. There is no evidence for a loop on the side. The socket is flat across both its length and width.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The horizontal moulding beneath the collar indicates that the axe was not of South Wales Type but may be of Type Welby, Type Yorkshire or other similar types of Ewart Park metalworking but also may possibly of Sompting or allied types of Llyn Fawr metalworking.","fourFigureLat":"51.44927745","fourFigureLon":"-3.25335867","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wenvoe","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20151043.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"27.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
