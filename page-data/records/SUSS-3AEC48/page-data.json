These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material.\n\nThe object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper part. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the base, which come to a halt about half way along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end. Other hollow examples include: WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. The opening is a maximum of 7.5mm in diameter. Like this object WILT-0C9A63 and NMS-0F4645 also have two rivet holes, one each side of the opening; on this piece they are 1.7mm in diameter. These holes are not seen on complete examples and may suggest repairs or a variation in design.\n\nDue to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete, the opening has a rough surface but that could be due to casting rather than an old break. Based on other known examples (e.g. SF-520513) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original. The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle with a hole through the centre of this bridge. This form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings. The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion. \n\nThis item measures 29.6mm in length, has a maximum width of 11.8mm and a thickness of 11.2mm. The item weighs 9.05g.","fourFigureLat":"50.874404","fourFigureLon":"-0.807508","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"42","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Burnett","datefound1":"February 16, 2008","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Laura Burnett","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"11.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lavant","county":"West Sussex","district":"Chichester","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lburnett/SUSS-3AEC48.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"29.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
