The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval/leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces. The socket is hollow and has cast side loops roughly half way up the socketed end on opposing sides. The spear head has broken across the near centre of the blade. The two pieces were found about 60cm apart. The blade edges are chipped and the mid-rib also shows signs of wear. The object has a smooth dark brown to olive green patina which is pitted in places.\n\n\n\nThis form of leaf-shaped spear with side-loops can be classified as Greenwell and Brewis Class IV.
