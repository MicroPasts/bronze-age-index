The remaining half tapers to a damaged point from a bulbous body down to a point with cast alternating ridges and grooves running up to the point. The alternating pattern is not present on the inside edge of the object and consists of 22 lines in total. The object appears to have snapped just pst the grooved body as seen on KENT-77A0BF. The point has also been blunted and splayed. The breaks seems to be heavily worn \n\n\n\nMeasurements: 41.7mm wide, 35.27mm high. 14.56mm thick. 20.36g\n\n\n\nDiscussion: A good number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database. Examples with a shape very similar to this example include PAS reference numbers KENT-77A0BF, NARC-925E14,  HAMP-6F4C45 and BERK-719DA8. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117).\n\n\n\nThey are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although the lozenge shaped recess at the bottom of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. This was possibly something such as a dagger handle, although the absence of evidence makes this conjectural. Another suggestion has been a Scabbard Chape, in which case the object would be the other way up. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.","fourFigureLat":"51.22656114","fourFigureLon":"0.7197557","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"35.27","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.56","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lenham","county":"Kent","district":"Maidstone","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT4C615E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"41.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
