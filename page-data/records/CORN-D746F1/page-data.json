The circular perforation is 3 mm in diameter and 4 mm in from the V-shaped notch above which is 19 mm long and 9 mm wide at the opening. The base of the blades on either side of the tang are slightly concave leading to heel-shaped corners which then curve outwards around the perforation and inwards again towards the notch. The blades are almost semi-circular in plan and are 60 mm long and together they are 54 mm wide towards the base. The tang is 35 mm long and 8 mm wide at the base of the blade and 2.7 mm thick and tapers to 5 mm wide and 2 mm thick at the tip.\n\n\n\nThis decorated bifid razor is classified as a Type Feltwell (Jockenhövel 1980) and dates from the Late Bronze Age from the Wilburton to the Ewart park phase, c.900-700 BC (Matt Knight pers comm).\n\n\n\nType Feltwell razors are common in Scotland and England, less so in Wales and Ireland. Rare examples can also be found on the Continent (Jockenhövel 1980; Plate 50, Map A).\n\n\n\nRef: Jockenhoevel, A.
