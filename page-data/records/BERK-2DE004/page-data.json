The object is tear-drop shaped in plan, hollow on the underside and its upper  surfaces are decorated with closely-set longitudinal grooves. The 'snout' of the object tapers and narrows in both plan and section, and gives the whole object the look of a hedgehog. It is likely that a long point protruding from the 'snout' has now broken off, as a number of similar examples on this database have long projections in this area.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"43","notes":"A number of objects of this type have been recorded on the PAS  database. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998,  no.117), and as such, they are thought to date from the middle Bronze  Age to the late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that  they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be  confirmed by excavation of a stratified example. Their function is  uncertain, although circular recesses at the bottom of some examples  suggests that they were mounted on or below something.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"January 01, 2011","datefound2":"August 16, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.23","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Winterbourne","county":"West Berkshire","district":"West Berkshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2011376.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"18.61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
