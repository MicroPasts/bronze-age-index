At one end the point tapers to a rounded point and has a circular section. The tang end is flattened and is sub-rectangular in section. The shaft is sub-rectangular in section. The surface of the awl is pitted and worn, with a light to dark green patina. It has been dated to the Bronze Age due to its fabric, however as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods. Awls were mostly associated with leather working, but also wood and bone working. Similar possible Bronze Age awls can be found in: Read, B. 2001. Metal Artefacts of Antiquity. Pp.91 & 94. No. 694.\n\n\n\nLength is 60.95mm. The tang is 6.47mm in width and 3mm thick. The point is 2.62mm thick. The widest point of the shaft is 7.05mm.
