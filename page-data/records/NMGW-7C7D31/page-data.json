The axe is moderately expanded towards the blade tips, with a width at the break of 39.37mm and a thickness of 10.10mm. There is no evidence for the base of a socket along the broken edge. The blade edge has a width of 47.44mm and has a comparatively deep curve. The short surviving areas of the sides are concave and exhibit finished casting seams. The surface is well preserved on one face of the axe with a dark brown patina and sharpening striations are evident running along the blade edge and with a width of c. 10mm. There is the suggestion of hammering facets near the break. The comparatively slender blade edge, out-turning to the tips may suggest a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Essex","district":"Braintree","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20061321.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"21.95"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
