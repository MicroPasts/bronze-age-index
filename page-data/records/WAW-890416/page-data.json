The gouge is complete, but the surface is in poor condition. Approximately half of the patina remains otherwise the surface is pitted and has areas of corrosion. The patina is a mottled dark green colour. The gouge is a sub-rectangle in plan, with the socketed terminal being slightly flared. It measures 95.41mm long and weighs 74.5g. The socket is circular in section, 13.85mm diameter, and tapers in the internal diameter. The opposite terminal, the blade edge is ‘C’ shaped in section. The blade is the terminal of a elongated triangular groove on the upper surface of the gouge. This groove starts 23mm from the socket and gradually increases in depth and width towards the blade terminal. Patina remains in the groove and has fine striations running from the mid point of the groove to the blade edge.\n\nThe gouge dates to the late Bronze Age, c.1150 to c.800 BC. Similar examples are found in Watson (Watson, P. 1993 Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums BAR British Series 233) illustrates two gouges, but one is decorated with ribbing (No. 72), and the second (No. 73) is undecorated, but is shorter, and the length of the groove is considerably shorter than the recorded example. A more similar example is illustrated in Annable and Simpson (Annable, F. and Simpson D. 1964 Guide Catalogue of the Neolithic and Bronze Age Collections in Devizes Museum Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society), No. 645.  Gouges were used as wood-working tools. \n\nDr. Adam Gwilt (National Museum and Galleries of Wales) commented on the gouge;  “Plain forms are the most common from the Late Bronze Age. Where dated by association, they usually belong to the Ewart Park phase (950-800BC). Examples with mouth mouldings tend to be earlier and belonging to the Wilburton / Blackmoor phases (1150-920BC)”","fourFigureLat":"52.354533","fourFigureLon":"-2.353801","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2006","datefound2":"February 21, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"13.85","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ribbesford","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wyre Forest","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-890416 Drawing.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Candy Stevens","length":"95.41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
