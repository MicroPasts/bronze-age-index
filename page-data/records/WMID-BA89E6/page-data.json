AD 1500).\n\n\nThe awl consists of a sub square sectioned artefact that gradually tapers from a wide centre, to a sharp point at both ends. No obvious tang is present. Faint grooves are present down each of the thicker sides.\n\n\nIt measures 51.35 mm in length, has a maximum width of 3.49 mm and has a maximum thickness of 3.24 mm. It weighs 2.4 g.\n\n\nThe probable awl is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\n\nSimilar artefacts have been recorded on the PAS database as NMS-ACEA64, NMS-0F5EF3, SF-6FC795, LVPL-7E3686, GLO-9FB903, HESH-399E94 and PUBLIC-5155C5. However as awls are a functional artefact, the form changes very little from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval period. Similar awls were found during the excavations at York (Ottaway & Rogers, 2002, pages 2729-2730, fig 1338), in particular SF 11522, which exhibits a similar groove on one side like this example and has been dated to the late 11th Century AD. Therefore this example could be of any date from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval Period (2150 BC to 1500 AD).\n\n\nReference:\n\nOttaway, P. & Rogers, N. 2002.
