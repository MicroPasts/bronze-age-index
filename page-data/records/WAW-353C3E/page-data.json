The object is trapezoidal in plan and wedge-shaped in cross-section with a flaring cutting edge and narrowed shaft. The sides descend from the butt almost vertically then fan out in a smooth curve to form the, now chipped, cutting edge. \n\n\n\nFor a comparable example see PAS record LIN-9CD5CA. According to Brundle (2021) 'diminutive axes are often associated with Roman votive offerings. However, the axe recorded here is clearly of a Bronze Age form. Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are becoming established. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III)', \n\n\n\nThe object measures 42mm in length and weighs 7g. \n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nBrundle, L (2021) LIN-9CD5CA: A BRONZE AGE MINIATURE OBJECT Web page available at: https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1038077 [Accessed: Dec 22, 2021 5:40:48 PM]","fourFigureLat":"52.18421423","fourFigureLon":"-2.08917464","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1700","notes":"\nPhotographs and dimensions kindly supplied by the finder via email. \n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Susheela Burford","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Susheela Burford","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Upton Snodsbury","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sburford/MiniaxeKDavis.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"42"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
