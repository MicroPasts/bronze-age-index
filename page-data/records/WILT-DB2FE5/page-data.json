It measures 36.62x42.05x30.07mm and weighs 35.7g.\n\n\nThe oval shaped mouth (36.79x30.07mm) is a single, outward-projecting moulding max.7.11mm thick from which extend ?4 vertical ribs on one face. The other face is badly damaged but at least 2 ribs are visible. At the edges of the axehead the casting flashes are visible, but have been worn down a little. On one of these sides a loop extends 25mm from the mouth moulding.\n\n\nThe damage is worn but probably not ancient. It could well have been casued by plough damage. Interestingly the damage is consistent with a large blow on one side, which is sometimes attributed to contemporary ritual destruction of the obect.\n\n\nAxes with rib decoration date to the Ewart Park and Llynfawr phases, 900-700 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.473853","fourFigureLon":"-2.159768","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"January 01, 2011","datefound2":"May 10, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"30.07","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chippenham Without","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Fry0711axehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"36.62"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
