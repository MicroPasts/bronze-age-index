The butt has been broken away by an old break. It is unlooped with narrow flanges fused to the stop ridge. The width at the butt is 21mm. The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt and a parallel in height to the septum. The stop ridge is plain with no decoration on the blade. The blade widens gently in width forming rounded (worn?) tips from which a crescentic cutting edge projects, max 39mm wide. The blade tapers in thickness to the edge with no edge bevel. The surface is worn and pitted.","fourFigureLat":"53.51160127","fourFigureLon":"-1.14194373","fromdate":"-2000","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Laura Pooley","datefound1":"April 30, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Justine Biddle","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jebiddle/Cove A - palstave 25.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"National Museums Liverpool","length":"121"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
