The top of the butt is flat and thin, with curved corners (with a butt width of 27.5mm and a thickness of 0.7mm). Beneath the butt the rivet-notches are a little irregular and of V-shaped profile (with a depth of 4.0mm - 4.4mm, a width of 7mm and are 18.8mm apart). Beneath the rivet-notches the sides widen to the shoulders, with some damage (with a width of 34.0mm, where the butt is 4.1mm thick). The edge at the top of the blade has a convex curve (for 13mm) before the near-straight edge, which gradually converges towards the tip (with a width of 18mm below the curved sides). The blade is thickest at the top of the blade (with a thickness of 5.0mm) and has a flat-topped midrib, curving from the shoulder and gradually narrowing until it defines a rib and produces a lozengic section to the blade (c. 35mm above the tip). There is no vertical hilt ridge but there is a hilt mark evident on one face, which has a slight convex curve from just below the shoulders. The blade has a gentle concave profile, each side of the midrib and sections of the blade edge are preserved. Much of the damage to the blade edge damage appears to be more recent although a few of the notches are patinated. Subtle striations are discernible, mostly running along the blade edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with some pitting and bright-green corrosion. The top of the butt has rounded hammering ridges from working and thinning and the butt has considerably less surface finishing than the blade.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Burgess C.B. & Gerloff S., 1981; The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland, Pra√§historische Bronzefunde Abteilung IV.
