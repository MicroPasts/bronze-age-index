There is a central rib running along the blade with a high profile and a lozenge shaped cross section that tapers towards the tip of the spear, which would mean that the fragment is likely from a Middle Bronze Age looped and socketed spearhead, similar to&nbsp;HESH-8E7894. The original blade would likely have been leaf-shaped.\n\nThe blade has lost much of its cutting edge due to abrasion in the soil.\n\n&quot;Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV; which she dates to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham&#39;s Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150&nbsp;BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of the Nantcwnlle spear was analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200&nbsp;BC. Davis (2012) classified this form of spearhead as his Group 6 Developed side looped - Type 6 B (flame - flat blade - lozenge plates).&quot;\n- Reavill, P (2017) HESH-8E7894: A BRONZE AGE SPEARHEAD Web page available at: https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/866581 [Accessed: 5 Aug 2022 12:11:05]","fourFigureLat":"52.79243489","fourFigureLon":"-2.86155268","fromdate":"-1450","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Malcolm Adams","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.17","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Baschurch","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/madams/WAWCFBA91.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"50.68"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
