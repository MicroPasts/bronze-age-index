This fragment represents the very tip of the spearhead. It is triangular in plan and lenticular in section. The spear tip has a median rib, which would have continued down the body of the spearhead. The fragment is solid, except for a short, circular hollow shaft in the broad end of the tip, which represents the very end of the hollow socket. This has an internal diameter of 7.34mm. The object has received damage along one edge, which runs onto the rib and it is also split up the rib either side. Edges are worn suggesting this damage occurred in antiquity. Aside from this damage the original surface of this object survives well with a mid brown patina. Damaged portions show light green corrosion product. The fragment is 45.46mm long, 17mm at the widest point, 10.14mm thick at the rib and weighs 10.14g. Unfortunately with so much of the spear missing, it is impossible to tell which phase of the Bronze Age it belongs to.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline McDonald","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline McDonald","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Little Thurlow","county":"Suffolk","district":"St. Edmundsbury","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/DSCN2311.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester Museums","length":"45.46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
