The jet is made of a domed body that is D-shaped in cross section with an oval base. The single sprue is oval in cross section extending 7.5 mm before ending in a rounded break. The jet is a dark, sometimes medium, green colour.\n\nThe jet is 24.8mm in diameter on its body and 18.8mm thick.The fragment weighs 24.88 grams.\n\nCasting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below. As they represent re-usable metal, they were often retained and regularly turn up in base metal hoards of the period. Casting waste is difficult to date, but fragments with similar shapes exist on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database (NMGW-57CD88, GLO-24BAE1, and IOW-904B38) ​​​​​​which are considered to be Late Bronze Age in date.&nbsp;Furthermore, Pearce (1983, 571, pl.10, no.82e) illustrates a similar casting jet with conical sprues from Lelant in Cornwall, which was found associated with swords fragments that are from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850&nbsp;BC) while Knight, Ormrod &amp; Pearce (2015, 82, pl.9, no.247f) illustrate a casting jet from Gussage All Saints in Dorset on which was found with a socketed axe mouth fragment.","fourFigureLat":"51.57947126","fourFigureLon":"-1.25096423","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"October 18, 2021","datefound2":"October 18, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"18.8","diameter":"24.8","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Hagbourne","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON7C88B5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
