The axe is narrow with straight but tapering sides and there are no signs of a stop ridge. The sides of the axe are very slightly thickened, but it does not have flanges.\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark green in colour with a heavily pitted and corroded patina.\n\n\n\nLength: 99.47mm, Width: 35.8mm, Thickness (blade): 2.91mm, Thickness (Mid-section): 9.08mm, Weight: 151.8g.\n\n\n\nThe axe probably fits into the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL.
