The tang flares out for a distance of about 32.0mm and then flares more widely to the cutting edge. The cutting edge is evenly rounded in plan and is steeply 'V'-shaped in side view. Each side of the tang has an uneven surface.\n \nThe surfaces have a mid-brown patina with some bubbly corrosion products. There is a small area of iron staining on one face close to the cutting edge.\n \n52.2 x 40.0 x 4.6mm. Weight: 20.29g.\n \nThe implement probably belongs to the earlier period of the Late Bronze Age (pers. comm., Peter Reavill, 16/02/2011.","fourFigureLat":"50.74363","fourFigureLon":"-1.321067","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"January 12, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Frank Basford","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Gurnard","county":"Isle of Wight","district":"Isle of Wight","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/fbasford/IOW2011-2-64.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Isle of Wight Council","length":"52.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
