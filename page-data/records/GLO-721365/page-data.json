The blade of the spearhead is leaf/lozenge-shaped with blades that gently angle inwards from an expanded midsection. Running down the centre of the blades is a triangular cross-section spine on both sides. Towards the edge of one blade, in the middle where it is at its widest point, is a drilled hole, this hole has been drilled from both directions, resulting in it having an hour-glass shape profile. The socket has a circular cross-section and expands from the base of the blades Some of the lower portion or the socket ostruncated, although remains of the rivet holes are still visible towards the base.","fourFigureLat":"51.90436815","fourFigureLon":"-2.52467389","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kurt Adams","datefound1":"November 01, 2010","datefound2":"August 31, 2014","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Kurt Adams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Weston under Penyard","county":"County of Herefordshire","district":"County of Herefordshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO721365.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Bristol City Council","length":"77"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
