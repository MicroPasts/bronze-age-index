The butt is thickened and of rectangular section (8.4mm wide and 5.2mm thick). The sides are straight and divergent before flaring to the expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 16.6mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The faces are somewhat irregular but generally flat and gradually convergent from the butt to the blade. There is no applied decoration to the object.\n\n\n\nThe wedge-shaped piece of lead has few diagnostic features, making any identification speculative and uncertain. The expanded blade edge is similar to axes of Bronze Age and later date, however a rectangular-sectioned block, hammered at one end would produce a similar ‘blade’ profile. The thickened squared butt is best paralleled in shaft-hole axes of Iron Age and later date but there is no suggestion of attempts to represent a shaft-hole. While miniature votive axes are recorded, these generally are of copper alloy and often represent socketed axe forms. Copper alloy shaft-hole axes are known, generally of Roman date but often include the handle in the representation.","fourFigureLat":"51.44832263","fourFigureLon":"-3.33967676","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Lead","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Llancarfan","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/miniature.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
