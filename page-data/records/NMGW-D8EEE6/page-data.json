The axe belongs to Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming). It can be dated to the Arreton metalworking phase (1725-1500 cal. BC), falling within the later half of Period 4 (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997).\n\n\n\nThe axehead has an overall length of 122.7mm and weighs 270.7g. The butt is rounded and has a width of 20mm. The septum gradually thickens to the curved and prominent median bevel, positioned 55mm from the butt. The sides are comparatively straight and diverge slightly towards the blade, with a width at the median of 26.5mm and a width of 29mm before the sides expand to the blade. The sides are curved across their thickness. The flanges are lozenge-shaped and are longer at the rear. The flanges come to a point at the butt and because the butt is convex, it is visible as the characteristic 'projecting tongue' when viewed from the side. The flanges have a maximum breadth at the position of the median of 21.6mm. The blade side expands to produce a deep crescentic blade edge with a width of 69.6mm. Blade facets are evident c. 14mm from the blade edge and may have been highlighted by a low step upwards running across the blade which is discernible on both faces. There are striations running across the width of the axe positioned on the blade between the beginning of the flange and the stop, these may possibly be only evident here because of better surface preservation. The striations may have been intended as crude decoration. The axe has been recently treated with an applied coating. The surface, where it survives, has a dark green to black patina (exaggerated by the applied coating) and has a silvery tint, probably because of surface tin enrichment.","fourFigureLat":"","fourFigureLon":"","fromdate":"-1725","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"March 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ruth Battye","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Market Drayton","county":"Shropshire","district":"Shropshire","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.49.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"122.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
