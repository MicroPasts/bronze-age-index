The surviving axe consists of part of the broken blade and body. The body of the axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge. The sides of the axe are triangular, and the body of the axe narrows towards the expanded blade. The blade edge is rounded and damaged in several areas through abrasion and corrosion. The inside of the axe is hollow and sub-rectangular in cross-section. The blade has been roughly evenly broken off at one end, the axe also has several areas of lamination and scratches on its outside surfaces, all of which are patinated, like all of the exterior surfaces, in a mid-green colour. The interior surfaces of the axe have a similar coloured patina.\n\n\n\nFound within the same findspot as metalworking debris (PAS no. LIN-5A04A4). \n\n\n\nThe axe measures 45.11 mm in length, 22.04 mm in width and 5.69 mm thick at the blade, 15.50 mm thick at the broken socketed end, 3.08 mm in maximum wall thickness, and weighs 34.78g.","fourFigureLat":"52.86483825","fourFigureLon":"-0.33772806","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lisa Brundle","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lisa Brundle","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.69","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pointon and Sempringham","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"South Kesteven","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"45.11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
