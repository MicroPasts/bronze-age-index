This object is oval in plan and sub-triangular in section, with one side tapering moderately and the other more gently from the centre of the upper surface. Along the upper surface of this artefact are the remains of a single casting jet or runner, which runs the length of the object and is rectangular in plan; it is also heavily abraded which has resulted in the loss of the complete form of the jet. The underside of this fragment is slightly convex and heavily worn, with the sides of this artefact rounded through abrasion. It has a light-mid green colour overall. The casting waste measures: 38.2mm length, 20.8 mm width and 10.8mm in thickness, with the casting runner 9.23mm wide, c.1.5mm high and set slightly off-centre. It weighs 22.41 grams.\n\n\nCasting waste is very hard to date in isolation but the patina and form might suggest a Bronze Age - Roman date. The survival of casting waste is also relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.","fourFigureLat":"51.083757","fourFigureLon":"-1.087674","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"March 31, 2011","datefound2":"April 29, 2011","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Ellis","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ropley","county":"Hampshire","district":"East Hampshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ljellis/HAMP-0171D2castingwaste.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Winchester Museums Service","length":"27.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
