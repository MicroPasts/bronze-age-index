The butt is straight and flat (with a width of 39mm and a thickness of 8.5mm) possibly suggesting the axe may have been reworked from a larger axe. The sides are straight and divergent for a short distance from the butt (approximately 20mm) before becoming concave and diverging to a moderately expanded blade edge (with a surviving width of 61.2mm). The sides are rounded across their thickness. The original blade edge has been lost and the edge is now comparatively straight with only a gentle curve. One of the blade tips has been lost and the axe has a pronounced distortion before the break. One face is flat, while the other is very gently convex across its length and both have a gentle convexity across their widths. There are no discernible developed features on the axe, such as a median bevel or flange. There is the suggestion of a short blade facet (6mm long) although this is more likely to be the result of corrosion and wear. The surface is heavily-corroded with a dark-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe flat axe is an unusual form and appears comparatively short and wide and thick-butted but now shows no evidence of breakage, possibly suggesting the butt has been reworked. The lack of any of any surviving developed features and the simple, curved-sided form to the axe may be suggestive of Type Migdale (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44) , of Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC. The axe also may be an axe-blank and the unworked flat face may demonstrates minimal working subsequent to its casting.\n\n\n\n1.
