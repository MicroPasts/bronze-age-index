The butt is of irregular trapezoidal form and is thinnest at the end (with a maximum width of 45.6mm and a minimum thickness of 2.3mm). There are no obvious rivet holes surviving on the butt although a slight recess near the centre of the top edge may possibly be the remnants of a rivet hole. A central ridge is evident just before the end of the butt and develops as a prominent mid-ridge on the top of the blade. The butt is asymmetric, with three edges on one side and two on the other, although the maximum width of the butt from the central ridge is consistent on both sides. The butt both narrows and thickens to the top of the blade (with a width of 31mm and a thickness of 4.9mm). The blade narrows further towards the break (to 24.0mm wide and 5.2mm thick). The prominent mid-ridge along the blade creates a lozengic blade section. The blade edges have been lost on both sides. There are a number of striations running at different angles off the edges of the butt that appear to be preserved beneath the patina and are discernible on both faces. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of grey-green surface loss and bright-green corrosion.\n\n\n\nThe fragmentary state of the blade and loss of diagnostic features makes identification difficult. The trapezoidal butt form and prominent mid-ridge on the blade may tentatively suggest a Group II – III blade but the lack of rivet holes further complicates any identification. The butt is comparatively substantial, possibly suggesting a larger weapon, perhaps a Group III rapier ‘with damaged butt’. If the suggestion of a Group II – III blade is correct, then the weapon is likely to relate to Acton Park to Taunton metalworking, dating to c. 1600 – 1300BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.71873558","fourFigureLon":"-4.82439822","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Mark Lodwick","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Jeffreyston","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/201719new.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"61.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
