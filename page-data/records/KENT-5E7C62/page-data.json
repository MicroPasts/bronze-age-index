Possibly of plain South Eastern Type.\n\n\n\nDescription: The fragment survives only as the blade end. The sides begin to curve inwards from the curved crescent blade-edge, flaring in section to a rectangle. The broken edges are heavily worn likely indicate breakage in antiquity although the variation in patination may indicate it happen while in the ground. The break across the body is irregular. The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to light brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety. It looks like it was not faceted or had a ribbed decoration.\n\n\n\nMasurements: 20.36mm long, 43.22mm wide, 10.15mm thick and 23.78g in weight","fourFigureLat":"51.97465982","fourFigureLon":"0.64835117","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Jo Ahmet","datefound1":"March 11, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Jo Ahmet","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10.15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Little Maplestead","county":"Essex","district":"Braintree","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT5E7C62.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Kent County Council","length":"20.36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
