The blade is flat with channelled grooves on the face where the stem rib meets the blade. The mid-rib is rounded and joins a broad circular sectioned socket, which has an outer inset bevel at the socket mouth. The loops are small and squat and are lozenge shape. The loops are undrilled - they are solid rather than hollow. A smaller spearhead but with an almost identical 'loops' was found in AD 1871 in Fyfield, only a couple of kilometers from this example, and is now in the Ashmolean (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706). A small number of similar spearheads with undrilled loops have recently been recorded from across Oxfordshire; from from Cherwell (BERK-D20304), Bampton (BERK-44F126) and Wendlebury (OXON-838037).\n\n\n\nWith a smooth dark green patina, there is no evidence of this item having been used. The edges are still sharp and there is no indication of wear. The socket diameter is 21.48mm. with an internal diameter of 18.0mm.\n\n\n\nRef: The Organisation of Middle Bronze Age metalworking by M.J. Rowlands, BAR (British Archaeological Reports) 31(i) 1976.
