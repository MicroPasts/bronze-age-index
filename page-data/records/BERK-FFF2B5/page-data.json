The cutting edge is slightly abraded on one edge although this appears to cut through the patina suggesting post-depositional damage. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The stop ridge has a small hole before it on one side, a probable casting flaw. There is a slight midrib down the centre of the blade on either side.\n\n\n\nThis palstave is particualrly similar to examples illustrated by Rowlands (1976: plate 29) all categoristed as his type 2 (side flanged) form dating to c. 1400-1150 cal BC. There are also good parallels illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981: plate 58) which correspond to their Group 2 (early Mid ribbed). They suggest this form is one of the earlier tpyes dating to the Acton Park to Taunton Phase of the bronze Age c.1500-1250 cal BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.77656771","fourFigureLon":"-1.14624584","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anni Byard","datefound1":"July 01, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anni Byard","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Stanton St. John","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2018136.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"170.3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
