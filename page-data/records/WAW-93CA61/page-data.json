The blade cutting edge is almost symmetrical and is rounded and blunt. In plan the blade tips/sides flare outwards markedly. In section, from the break to the blade the section is an elongated triangle. The break, which is a short rectangle in plan, is not recent as the patina on the break matches that on the surface of the axe. The surface of the axe has patches of a well developed dark brown patina. It weighs 62.3g. From the cutting edge to the broken edge it measures 39.52mm; across the blade, from tip to tip, it measures 45.6mm wide; across the break it is 12.57mm thick.\n\n\n\nThe whether the axe was originally a socketed axe or flat axe is not known for certain but the size at the break may suggest it is more likely to be a socketed axe dating to the late Bronze Age; 1,000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.33299703","fourFigureLon":"1.40373766","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"January 01, 2013","datefound2":"October 29, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.57","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Linstead Magna","county":"Suffolk","district":"Suffolk Coastal","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-93CA61.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"39.52"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
