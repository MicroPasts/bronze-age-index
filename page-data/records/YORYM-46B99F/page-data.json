The fragment is the blade end including the base of the socketed area. It is a tapering rectangle in section and trapezoidal in plan with a worn flared cutting edge and rounded corners. The breaks at the socketed end are old and worn and casting flashes are present along either side. The surface of the axehead is undecorated.\n\n\n\nThe metal has a mid-reddish-brown patina and is worn. The fragment is 61.5mm long, 42.9mm to 32.1mm wide, 16.2mm to 4.7mm thick and weighs 96g.\n\n\n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"54.02470345","fourFigureLon":"-0.35288456","fromdate":"-10000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"16.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Harpham","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","district":"East Riding of Yorkshire","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/CWC0003.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"61.9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
