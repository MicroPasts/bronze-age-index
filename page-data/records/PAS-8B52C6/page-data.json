The object now has a sub-trapezoidal form, being rounded at the blade tip, and tapering gradually towards it.  At the attachment end the object becomes waisted and narrowed, indicative of a tanged handle.  However, all of the sides of the artefact are abraded, with a number of significant notched removals.  In cross-section the object is the shape of a very flat pointed oval.  The surface is pitted on both surfaces.\n\n\n\nThe object measures 60.4 by 20.1 by 2.6mm and weighs 11.28g\n\n\n\nTanged knives date to the Wilburton phase (LBA2), reaching into Early Ewart Park (LBA3) : c.1000-850 BC.","fourFigureLat":"51.99283217","fourFigureLon":"-1.21496059","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-850","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rob Webley","datefound1":"March 29, 2015","datefound2":"March 29, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rob Webley","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"2.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Croughton","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"South Northamptonshire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley2/PAS8B52C6knife.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"60.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
