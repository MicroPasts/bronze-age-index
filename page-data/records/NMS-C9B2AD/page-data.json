The butt end exhibits a large notch and traces of damage. The socket is formed by a set of right angled flanges which flank the flat central area and increase in height towards the centre of the blade where they are joined by a horizontal stop ridge, forming an H in cross-section. The flanges are slightly damaged along the topmost edge on both sides, with pitting on the outward facing sides of each flange. Immediately below the stop ridge is a shield shaped depression. The blade has inward-bowing sides which flare towards the blade which terminates in a convex cutting edge, now heavily abraded. There is a vertical casting seam along each long edge, tool-marks indicating that this was filed down during finishing. The presence of a casting seam indicates the use of a two-piece mould in production. The surface has a smooth dark brown patina, heavily pitted and damaged by abrasion in places, showing as a dark green.","fourFigureLat":"52.45542227","fourFigureLon":"1.20706841","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1400","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"August 11, 2018","datefound2":"August 11, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wacton","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/62974_C9B2AD_MBA_Palstave.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"162"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
