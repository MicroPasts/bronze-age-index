It comprises a strip of sheet gold with a jagged transverse break across the wide end. The plate tapers along its length into a square-sectioned hook which curves under the plate. Just behind the hook is a circular perforation punched from the reverse of the strip to the front.\n\n\n\nDimensions: Length (bent): 26.7mm, maximum width: 15mm, minimum width: 1.5mm, thickness: 1.2mm, weight: 1.8g.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: A number of similar objects have been reported as potential Treasure and are recorded on the PAS database, including HAMP-B9814B (2018T700), SUR-DE6DF2 (2017T644) and BH-1BE953 (2014T901). This last states: “There is a range of gold strip and ribbon ornaments datable to the British Bronze Age. The less numerous types include arm and possibly ear ornaments fastening by means of a hook at each end, or a hook and eye (piercing)… There are also an increasing number of (often) thin gold strips and fragments with terminal piercings which on grounds of composition could fit into a Bronze Age context. Again, there are continental analogues, beginning within the Early Bronze Age sheet gold tradition.”\n\n\n\nDate: c. 1500 – 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.7383663","fourFigureLon":"1.05001292","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-800","notes":"The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently, in terms of both age and precious metal content, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\n\n\nIn addition, it seems likely that this find is part of the Bawdeswell hoard, originally reported as 2009T653 (NMS-30B786), containing a socketed knife and two socketed axeheads. Addenda to this hoard include 2016T503 (NMS-8E5122, a socketed axehead), 2018T638 (NMS-A215F7, a MBA to LBA sword fragment) and 2020T17 (NMS-5FF2B8, a socketed axehead). The Bawdeswell Bronze Age hoard now contains seven objects; fragments of four socketed axes, a socketed knife, a sword and a fragment of gold.","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"August 27, 2018","datefound2":"August 27, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Donated to museum by all parties, hence disclaimed as Treasure","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sparham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Breckland","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ellmcdonald/56476_A38BB2_BA_Unidentified.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"26.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
