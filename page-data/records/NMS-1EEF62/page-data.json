There are two opposed rivet-holes in the sides adjacent to the flat mouth of the internal hollow. The object is unbroken and must have comprised one of two separate parts of a composite moustache-shaped fitting, unlike most examples, which are complete or to be part of broken objects cast in one. Deep multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper part of the moustache the end plain where it tapers to a point. Height / length 25.5mm. Width 14.5mm. Thickness 14.5mm. Weight 9.69g. The date of this enigmatic object is uncertain. Examples occurred in the Salisbury Hoard, which contained Bronze Age material but was buried in the Iron Age (Stead 1998). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (see entry for HAMP-C04CC3).
