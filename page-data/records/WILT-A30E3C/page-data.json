The axe is elegantly cast being relatively slender and well proportioned with a trumpet shaped collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade.\n\n\n\nThe mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section. The shape of the mouth is sub-rectangular (rectangular with rounded corners) at measures 33.25mm wide. The trumpet-shaped mouth of the axe tapers and the loop is relatively small in a low position set well beneath the collar. Directly above the loop is a cast decorative circumferential ridge The loop is D-shaped in cross section (5.95mm wide). The upper body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The lower section of the axe flares to form an elegantly expanding blade (38.3mm wide). The casting flashes on the sides of the axe are still visible and have not been finished. The cutting edge itself is abraded, although the crescent shaped edge is regular suggesting little evidence of wear / sustained use. Apart from the grooves below the collar there is no evidence of other ornament on the axe.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axe is 80.75mm in length, 38.3mm wide, 33.4mm thick and weighs 90.57 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.69810185","fourFigureLon":"-1.61073641","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Richard Henry","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Richard Henry","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"33.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grafton and Radcot","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"West Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jshoemark/WILTA30E3C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"80.75"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
