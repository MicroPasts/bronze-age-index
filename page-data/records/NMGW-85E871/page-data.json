While socketed axeheads can date from anytime within the Late Bronze Age, most diagnostic finds tend to date to the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC). The axe head is represented by the blade only and has a maximum surviving length of 35.8mm. The bottom of the socket is present and has been deliberately closed by battering; this damage is also likely to have contributed to the break. Both faces are concave as a result of the damage, the bronze has torn on one face and deep battering scars are evident on the other face. The surviving portion of the side is straight with angles converging to the neatly finished casting seam (giving the axe a hexagonal body profile). The blade is expanded at the tips, producing a surviving blade width of 51.8mm. The Blade edge is curved and has also been damaged and blunted. Most of the surface has been lost, although a small area near the blade has the suggestion of sharpening striations running along the blade. The original surface has a dark green patina, while underlying exposed surface is pale green.
