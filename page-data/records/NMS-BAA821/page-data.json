Longitudinal rib on upper edge with possible traces of transverse nicks, transverse median rib flanked by two smaller ribs also with possible traces of transverse nicks, upper edge and midpoint obscured by iron corrosion, remainder of object corroded, surface missing. Height 21mm. Width 41mm. Thickness 7mm. Weight 7.38g. The date of this enigmatic object is uncertain. Examples occurred in the Salisbury Hoard, which contained Bronze Age material but was buried in the Iron Age (Stead 1998). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (see entry for HAMP-C04CC3).
