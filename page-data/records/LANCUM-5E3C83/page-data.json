The object is a butt riveted small blade dagger or knife with triangular blade. The blade would have been attached to the hilt by means of three large rivets, the top side one is still in place. The rivet is circular in cross-section and flat-hourglass-shaped in plan. The other two are missing and the other rivet holes are incomplete due to breaks or possibly corrosion. The object is quite damaged so it is difficult to ascertain the exact type, but it is similar to Needham's series 2 (id 1200 Carder Low Type 2B or 1204 Parsley Hay Type 2A) or a series 7 (ID 1260 Thomas Hardye School Type 1 B4/7A). The condition of the object is reasonably good. It is patinated dark green/brown with damage to the blade and the top is missing. The length is 50mm, the width is 28mm (photos from finder).\n\n\n\nSimilar in form to SF9298 though larger which itself is similar to examples from Shrewton, Wilts (associated with a pommel and a beaker) and Driffield, Yorks which was associated with a beaker, stone wristguard with gold rivet caps and two amber buttons.\n\n\n\nEBA daggers are rare in the north (and very rare in the northwest) - and are high status EBA funerary artefacts usually found in barrows (Ben Roberts pers com 24.07.18).\n\n\n\nClarke, D.L., 1970 Beaker Pottery of Great Britain and Ireland Cambridge University: Cambridge University Press , figs 549 and 543\n\n\n\nNeedham, S.P., 1996 Chronology and periodisation in the British Bronze Age Copenhagen: Wiley","fourFigureLat":"53.94588458","fourFigureLon":"-2.23001903","fromdate":"-2150","todate":"-1500","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"June 04, 2018","datefound2":"June 04, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Horton","county":"Lancashire","district":"Ribble Valley","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUM5E3C83.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"50"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
