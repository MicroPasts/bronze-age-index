The object is in a worn but fair condition with some original surface present. It has a rectangular form and cross section at the butt end with a prominent stop rib and gently tapering flanges. On one side the circular scars of a handle can be seen, positioned in the butt end, with one end aligned to the stop rib. At the blade end the object begins with an almost square cross section at which point there is a prominent, wide rib, visible on both faces, which runs about half the length of the blade. The blade tapers in width to the point and is triangular in form with a wide curving tip, which is intact but very worn.\n\n\n\nThe object fits Burgess group IIIa and is similar to examples in BAR233 p.8. fig.47/48.","fourFigureLat":"52.72161642","fourFigureLon":"-1.30558271","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wendy Scott","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"August 10, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wendy Scott","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"27","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Charley","county":"Leicestershire","district":"North West Leicestershire","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/LEIC1D429E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Leicestershire County Council","length":"153"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
