Only a portion of the blade remains.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is from the body of the blade. It has a hexagonal shaped cross section with wide flat faces and then bevelled blades edges which have been abraded and chipped to become rounded. It narrows slightly from one transverse break (c.16.7mm wide, to the other (c.15.2mm wide). Both breaks are worn preventing identification wether the breaks are deliberate or not. A thick dark green patina covers the majority of the fragment although it is chipped away in places revealing a green patina below.\n\n\n\nThe fragment is 29.8mm long, 16.7mm wide, 4.2mm thick and weighs 9.29 grams.\n\n\n\nWhile a more recent Roman or Medieval date should not be excluded the form of this fragment is consistent with many other rapier fragments recorded by the PAS including NMGW-587A08, SUR-BCF0BA and DENO-0EAF9A","fourFigureLat":"51.74005975","fourFigureLon":"-1.07452002","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Edward Caswell","datefound1":"August 28, 2021","datefound2":"August 28, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Edward Caswell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4.2","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Waterstock","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON7DE9EB.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"29.8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
