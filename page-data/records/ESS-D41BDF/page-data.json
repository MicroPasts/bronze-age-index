There are ribs visible on the surface. The inside of the fragment is plain. The patina is mostly red/brown with areas that have worn away to reveal green colouring. The red/brown colouring attests to the likely inclusion of a significant amount of iron in the alloy.\n\n\n\nThe fragment has a weight of 17.6g, a length of 33.2mm, a width of 30.3mm and a  maximum thickness of 6.1mm.","fourFigureLat":"51.8376893","fourFigureLon":"0.3209317","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Sophie Flynn","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sophie Flynn","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"6.1","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Great Dunmow","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/slflynn/ESSD41BDF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service","length":"33.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
