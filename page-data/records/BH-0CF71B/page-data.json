At the opposite end there is one surviving shoulder, which terminates in an uneven worn break, revealing the hollowed interior, which extends right through to the tip. The external edges of the blade are uneven in form and are all worn and rounded, as is the tip. \n\n\n\nOn one side the body is significantly damaged with a large portion of the once conical socket compressed and collapsed in several places with several portions missing, revealing the hollow interior within. The junctures between the socket and blade are also cracked in several places along the length of the blade either side of the compressed and collapsed areas.\n\n\n\nThe opposite face remains intact but is likewise compressed along the central axis of the blade, with subsequent cracking in several areas either side.\n\n\n\nThe form of the spearhead suggests that it is probably a conical spearhead variant. The shape of the blade resembles the leaf-shaped spearheads of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage (1000-800 BC) and is probably a Davis Group 7 type missing its more diagnostic side-loop and decorative features. Peter Reavill and Dot Boughton note that as it is missing these features, the earliest to which it could date is 1150 BC during the late Penard metalworking phase. \n\n\n\nFor a broadly comparable Davis Group 7 Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (1150 BC-600 BC) spearhead with the more diagnostic side-loop and decoration recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database, see SWYOR-FD8F64.","fourFigureLat":"51.65004531","fourFigureLon":"-1.06189969","fromdate":"1150","todate":"600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Peter Reavill","datefound1":"June 06, 2020","datefound2":"June 06, 2020","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Brightwell Baldwin","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"South Oxfordshire","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH0CF71B.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
