The bead is circular in plan, and is rectangular with rounded edges in profile. The central hole is 9.02mm diameter and is slightly irregular. One side of the bead is slightly more narrow then the other; there is a 0.16mm difference. This may be due to casting rather than wear. The surface of the bead has small areas of corrosion, otherwise it has a mid-dark green patina. The bead measures 16.76mm diameter and 10.98mm thick. It weighs 8.97g.\n\nThe bead could date from the Bronze Age to possibly the Roman period.","fourFigureLat":"52.121281","fourFigureLon":"-2.089049","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"410","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"April 24, 2006","datefound2":"May 24, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.76","edge":null,"thickness":"10.98","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Pershore","county":"Worcestershire","district":"Wychavon","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-63B0B4.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
