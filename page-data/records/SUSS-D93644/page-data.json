Its remains consist of a sub-rectangular body in plan, with the remains of the side flanges visible on both faces, though completely flattened on one side. Due to its poor condition, it is difficult to tell if the side flanges were fused or if they were separate elements, but it is likely that these were fused; hence, the date above is suggested for similar types. The chisel or possible axe blade edge has been completely worn away, making a positive identification difficult. The metal surface of the object suffers from bronze disease as well as differential areas of dark brown patina and lighter green patina. An area within the side flanges has built up a higher degree of green corrosion, perhaps indicating where the stop would have been. It measures 109.27 mm long, 21.51 mm maximum width, 12.63 maximum thickness and weighs 107 grams.","fourFigureLat":"50.993476","fourFigureLon":"-0.262969","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"-1300","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"November 02, 2011","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Toby Bowman","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.63","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cowfold","county":"West Sussex","district":"Horsham","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/04bowmant/RICHARD LYON 2.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"109.27"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
