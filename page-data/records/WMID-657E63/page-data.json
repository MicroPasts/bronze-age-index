The blade wings to either side of the tapering midrib are incomplete and badly corroded, but their overall shape remains, with the blade wings to either side of the midrib measuring at 7mm in width and 2.5mm thick. The width of the midrib at the tip measures 4.5mm, which then expands to approximately 10.5mm where the blades to either side terminate. Additionally, the midrib is diamond-shaped in section where the blade wings appear to either side, but then expands outwards and continues in length to form a circular sectioned socket 35mm from where the blade wings terminate. At approximately 10mm below the blade wings, there are the remains of side-loops to either side of the socket, with a casting ridge also present either side and in line with these loops, indicating the casting manufacturing process. The circular socketed terminal is complete and still completely filled with earth. Overall, the artefact is in a worn and corroded condition with some areas of bronze disease, particularly on the blade wings and midrib. One side of the spearhead survives better than the other and there are still large areas where the original dark green patina remains.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples are illustrated in H N Savory's 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections', 1980, pages 112 & 175, fig 27, ref nos 227-229, which are all examples of socket-looped spearheads, found at Cadoxton-juxta-Neath, Glamorgan; Llanfair Clydogau, Cardiganshire and Llanerfyl, Montgomeryshire respectively.\n\n\n\nOther examples are also illustrated in M R Ehrenberg's 'Bronze Age Spearheads from Berks, Bucks and Oxon', 1977, pages 34, 41, 44 & 52, ref nos 36, 74, 94 & 142, which are described as 'pegged leaf-shaped spearheads' and were found at Cookham, Berks; Maidenhead, Berks; Pusey, Berks (Oxon) and Old Windsor, Berks respectively.","fourFigureLat":"52.633574","fourFigureLon":"-1.794576","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Johnson","datefound1":"September 25, 2006","datefound2":"September 25, 2006","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Johnson","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"15.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Swinfen and Packington","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Lichfield","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-657E63.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"79.5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
