This fragment comprises of the lower socket, circular in cross section and tapering towards the point, now lost, and with flattened attachment loops projecting from either side, these are sub oval when the spear head is viewed in profile.\n\n\n\nDimensions: length 41.7mm; width 19.8mm; diameter of mouth 16.4mm; weight 18.47g.\n\n\n\nThe fragment fits with another (see: WILT-E1266C), although the relative condition of the fragments and breaks would suggest that the breaks are due to more recent damage, rather than anything prior to or during deposition; thus, the fragments are not likely to constitute a hoard and do not qualify as treasure under the terms of the treasure act of 1996. The spear head fits into Davies' (2012, in 2017) form 6, which he suggests accounts for almost half of EBA/MBA spear heads found in Britiain and dates to the Acton Park and Taunton metal working phases.","fourFigureLat":"51.10528443","fourFigureLon":"-2.05851037","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Wil Partridge","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Wil Partridge","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"16.4","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chilmark","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridge/WILTE14BAE.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"41.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
