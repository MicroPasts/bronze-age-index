The lower of the three fragments would have been near the original socket rim and would have had a diameter of approximately 15mm. The sides of the socket are straight and converge towards the blade. The lower socket fragment was bent outwards prior to breaking. The loops have flat tops and begin 21.5mm from the current base, with lengths of 15.6mm and 17.0mm (3.3mm and 3.9mm internal). The casting flashes are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished. The blade is leaf-shaped and is slender with a maximum surviving width near its base of 19.5mm. The blade edges are straight and blade facets are discernible. The central rib is slender and comparatively high, producing a concave-sided lozenge blade profile. The tip of the spearhead has been lost. The surface of the spearhead is well-preserved with a dark-brown patina.","fourFigureLat":"53.151952","fourFigureLon":"-4.244556","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1120","notes":"This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.391) and classed within his Type 6C Developed side-looped (Flame, flat blade, narrow plates). Davis (2012, 82f.) lists 131 of this type of spearhead from Britain, with concentrations around the Thames Valley, East Anglia, Wessex and the east Midlands, and scattered distribution in Wales and Scotland. Another Type 6C spearhead was recovered from Llaneugrad, Isle of Anglesey (Davis 2012, No.414).\n\n\n\nDavis notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Caernarfon","county":"Gwynedd","district":"Gwynedd","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.61.1.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"135"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
