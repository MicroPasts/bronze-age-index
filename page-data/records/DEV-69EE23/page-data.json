The axehead&nbsp;has a solidly rectilinear butt which&nbsp;flares outwards very gradually as it develops into the blade, and ultimately a narrow cutting edge. In profile the butt end expands into flanges to give it broadly triangular sides;&nbsp;the stop ridge is deep which creates a distinctive &#39;H&#39; cross section&nbsp;(Pearce&nbsp;1983,&nbsp;29- 30,&nbsp;582).&nbsp;This axehead appears to be of &#39;class 2, group 1&#39; as&nbsp;there is a distinct central mid-rib on the upper&nbsp;blade. There is no decoration on the lower blade, towards the cutting edge.&nbsp;\n\nMeasurements: 123 mm in length and&nbsp;24 mm in width at the middle. The butt end is 20 mm and then flares to the blade end with a width of 39 mm. The weight is&nbsp;210.93 g\n\nWhere the surface patina survives it is a dark green colour, verging on black in places. Otherwise, the surface is largely corroded, with pitting in places.","fourFigureLat":"50.77619189","fourFigureLon":"-3.83099004","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1275","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"June 17, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Courtney McElhinney","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bow","county":"Devon","district":"Mid Devon","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rwebley2/DEV69EE23palstave.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Somerset County Council","length":"123"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
