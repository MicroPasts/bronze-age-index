It comes from a plain axe with a 'rope' upper mouth moulding. There is no indication of casting seams, meaning that it is a fragment of a face, not a side of the axe. Moreover, the mouth fragment comes from a mis-cast axe, as the thinness of one side/face and mouth moulding indicate. It is questionable whether or not it was ever used. If the mis-casting meant that it was too incomplete and the structure was too weak for use, it would have been recycled. This is probably what this fragment was meant for.","fourFigureLat":"54.53783196","fourFigureLon":"-2.58880921","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-950","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"January 01, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Dot Boughton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Crosby Ravensworth","county":"Cumbria","district":"Eden","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dboughton/BaFKPAxefrgmMeaburn1ab.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"LCC","length":"39"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
