The tool weighs 3.17g, has a length of 41.0mm, width of 5.1mm and thickness of 5.0mm being thickest and widest at the centre. One half of the tool tapers to a rectangular cross-section measuring 4.3mm width and 1.3mm thick at the flat rounded terminal. Some wear is present at the tip of this half of the artefact and it is uncertain whether the tip originally had squared corners rather than gently rounded as is the current shape. The other half of the tool starts as a sub-square cross-section at the centre point and then tapers with a sub-circular and then circular cross-section to a pointed tip.  This artefact is possibly a very worn tanged collared chisel.  There are lots of parallels from the Wilburton and Ewart Park complexes.","fourFigureLat":"52.10233651","fourFigureLon":"0.11561801","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Helen Fowler","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Helen Fowler","gridSource":"Centred on field","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Whittlesford","county":"Cambridgeshire","district":"South Cambridgeshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/hfowler/CAM-5F6326.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Cambridgeshire County Council","length":"41"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
