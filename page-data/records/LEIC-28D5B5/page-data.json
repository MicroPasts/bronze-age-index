It comprises a folded&nbsp;rectangular strip of sheet&nbsp;or ribbon gold. It is decorated with&nbsp;around 16&nbsp;parallel ridges running along its length across one side; the reverse is undecorated.&nbsp;\n\nLength: 72.6 mm\nWidth: 12.7 mm&nbsp;\nWeight: 4 g\n\nNotes:\n\nThe object is consistent with a number of examples which have been determined to be Treasure on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database including 2014T777 (HEMP-36C41B), 2018T642 (NMS-A603B), 217T672 (NMS-B2D198), 2019T991 (DUR-9B1BA0), 2019T866 (HEMP 37143A), 2011T459 (LIN-946F12) and 2020T516 (SWYOR-DBF058). Incised longitudinal grooves are present on at least one side of many of these examples. Some are plain strips whilst others exhibit one or two perforations. Furthermore, the design is redolent of two examples from the multi-period site of Ranvecliffe Cave in Derbyshire, held within the British Museum Collections 1906.1224.1 and 1906.1224.2. These examples were postulated to date to the period between circa 2500-800&nbsp;BC, providing a broad Late Neolithic to Late Bronze Age date. Other dates recorded within the Treasure cases suggest a narrower period between circa 2200-800, encompassing the entirety of the Bronze Age, whilst 2014T777 suggests a Middle to Late Bronze Age date of between circa 1600-800&nbsp;BC. As a result, a broad Bronze Age date is offered here of between circa 2300-800&nbsp;BC. In all of these examples, it is not clear what their function was.","fourFigureLat":"53.27197301","fourFigureLon":"-1.9414806","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Gold","identifier":"","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Submitted for consideration as Treasure","recorder":"Megan Gard","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Corbar","county":"Derbyshire","district":"High Peak","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/28D5B5.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Derby Museums Trust","length":"76.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
