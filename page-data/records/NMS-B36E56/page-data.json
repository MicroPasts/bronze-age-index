The probable oval-shaped mouth is missing, as is one face almost to the base of the socket. Approximately half of a loop survives on the lower side. The body has slight traces of casting flash and some post-removal witness marks survive. The nominally 23mm wide parallel shape of the body flares at it's lower end to form the blade and cutting edge which estimates to 33mm wide. The surface is pock-marked with evidence of a rich brown patina breaking down to active blue-green corrosion. Probably a plain South-Eastern type class A1 and dateable to the Ewart Park phase circa 1000-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.57823439","fourFigureLon":"1.31937422","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Garry Crace","datefound1":"March 20, 2018","datefound2":"March 20, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Garry Crace","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Caistor St. Edmund","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/P1080825.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Norfolk County Council","length":"64"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
