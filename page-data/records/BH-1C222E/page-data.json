The object has a broken, irregularly shaped, oval faced base that is triangular in cross-section and narrows towards the remains of a surviving oval-sectioned jet projecting on one side. The break is old and very worn. The jet is unevenly formed and has a broken terminal consisting of a worn break. The surfaces of the object are worn and lightly pitted in some areas: most heavily on the flat face. All the surfaces have a relatively even mid-green patina with several areas covered by blight brown deposition residue. \n\n\n\nThe object measures 22mm in length, 16mm wide and 25.3mm high. It weighs 25.69 grams.\n\n\n\nThe object is likely to be from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite, probably two part, mould that formed when the metal was poured into the neck of the mould and shrunk upon cooling. Casting waste is very hard to date in isolation, and a piece with this patination could date from the Bronze Age to Roman period. The fact that this mould comes to an oval broken edge may suggest that it was for casting a palstave or possibly a tool, and therefore most likely dates to the Middle Bronze Age. Such material is rare as metals such as copper-alloy were usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.\n\n\n\nSimilar examples on the PAS database include LVPL-F7963B, DEV-8467F2, LVPL-3AAD50 and HESH-B55DB1.","fourFigureLat":"52.04842979","fourFigureLon":"0.11307059","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"450","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"August 31, 2019","datefound2":"November 30, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"17.5","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"7.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Chrishall","county":"Essex","district":"Uttlesford","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH1C222E.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"28.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
