The axe shares similarities with the Taunton metalwork assemblage and Hotham related to the palstaves of the Acton Park metalwork assemblage to which it bears some resemblance similar to Needham et al fig 140 (1985) and Read (1995: p.3 fig 9 ) Dated to 1200 BC. The axe is almost complete and is relatively long with a length of 150mm. The butt is slightly concave and has a width of 30mm. The flanges are flat, long in form in plan, straight and parallel as far as the stop but do not extend all the way to the butt, with a width at the stop of 30mm. The blade is flaring 72mm wide with a slightly bevelled facet possibly as a result of hammering. The septum is very small and hard to discern and the edge of the butt maybe slightly broken. The axe has a green patina with green colouration in patches and there are various nicks along the length The axe is 30mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.\n\n\n\nBritish Bronze Age metalwork. A1-6., Early Bronze Age hoards / by Stuart P. Needham, Andrew J. Lawson and H. Stephen Green.
