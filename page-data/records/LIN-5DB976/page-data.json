Only the blade-end survives. The blade is curved and flares at both ends. The extent of the flared ends is not great, suggesting that it has been resharpened a number of times in antiquity. The body widens to the break, where it is rectangular in cross-section with a hollow centre. The edges of the break are slightly irregular, but in totality form a regular 'slice' across the axe. It is unclear whether the break is intentional or the result of damage. The surface of the axe has a dark-green patina, which is irregularly pitted throughout.\n\n\nThe blade width is 45mm. The rectangular section at the break measures 34mm x 15mm. The wall of the section measures 3.5mm thick.","fourFigureLat":"53.359022","fourFigureLon":"-0.318558","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Adam Daubney","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Adam Daubney","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Linwood","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/LIN2013-571.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Lincolnshire County Council","length":"45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
