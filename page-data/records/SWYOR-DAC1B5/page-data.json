Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'. The surviving loop is a projecting shallow arch through which string or cord would pass to attach the spear head to the shaft. The blade is leaf shaped with a sub-lozenge shaped midrib section with a groove on each side of the rib. The midrib extends to the tip of the narrow blade. The spear head has had a small notch taken out of one edge at the mid point. This was done during removal from the ground. The spear head is suffering from active bronze disease.","fourFigureLat":"53.439482","fourFigureLon":"-1.113289","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1250","notes":"\nRecorded at a rally\n","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Kevin Leahy","datefound1":"October 02, 2008","datefound2":"October 05, 2008","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Stuart Ward","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"21.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Tickhill","county":"Doncaster","district":"Doncaster","regionName":"Yorkshire and the Humber","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sward/21 - Bronze Age spearhead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"139.2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
