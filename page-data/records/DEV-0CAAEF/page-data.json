It is rectangular in cross section, although the blade narrows to its original cutting surface. It appears undecorated but the surface is pitted and marked across the dark green shiny patina. There is a small area on one side near the blade which has decayed in a different manner, and is now a far brighter green and much more corroded, although there are no signs of bronze disease or ongoing decay. \n\n\n\nIt is similar to CORN-68C636, the record for which states that:\n\n\n\nSimilar slender flat axeheads with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.\n\n\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC).... \n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015: 87, no. 3, 11, 213) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Boscastle in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawton in Devon and Burton in Dorset.\"\n\n\n\nMeasurements: 83.1mm length, 29.9mm width (blade), 14.9mm width (butt), 5.6mm thickness, weight 46.5g.","fourFigureLat":"50.84467788","fourFigureLon":"-3.43594251","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-2000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Lucy Shipley","datefound1":"May 04, 2019","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Lucy Shipley","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.6","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Cullompton","county":"Devon","district":"Mid Devon","regionName":"","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/lshipley2018/DEV0CAAEF.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"83.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
