The butt (with a width of 23.2mm and a thickness of 4.8mm) is near-straight lower at the centre. The sides are straight and near-parallel to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 15.8mm, where the stops have a height of 24.0mm and the flanges have a height of 27.9mm). The sides have a linear divergence along the blade, before flaring out to the blade tips, producing a moderately expanded and rounded blade edge (with a blade width of 55.0mm and a blade depth of 18mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly finished but there is no ridged or ‘nicked’ sides evident. The flanges rise from the butt and would have had a straight top edge but are now damaged, giving the suggestion of a rounded lozenge form to the sides of the axe.  The flanges reached their maximum heights just above the stop (16mm above the stop and with a maximum surviving height of 32.8mm). The septum is gently rounded across its width but near-perpendicular to the flanges and stops (with a maximum flange heights of 13.1mm and a stop height of 7.8mm - 8.6mm). The stops have a slight curve across their widths and both stops extend above the faces (with a height of 4.2mm and a thickness of 5mm - 6mm).Because of a hollowing at the top of the blade the flanges have the impression of extending onto the faces. Both faces have hollowing beneath the stop, although appearing rounded, related to a ‘shield’ form on one face and more squared on the other. There is the suggestion of a weak midrib on one face, through the shield-shaped hollowing and extending onto the blade (with a length of 36mm). No rib is discernible on the other face. There is a clear rounded blade facet on both faces (20mm from the blade edge). The surface is heavily-pitted with much of the original surface lost and with a dark-brown patina. The surface is magnetic, suggesting deposition within iron rich deposits, possibly boggy. \n\n\n\nThe palstave is of an early form and has a depression below the stop rather than a shield moulding. The suggestion of a subtle midrib may indicate similarities to ‘Early Midribbed palstaves’. Primary Shield Pattern and Early Midribbed palstaves are likely to both be of Acton Park metalworking, dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schmidt, P.K. & Burgess, C. 1981; The Axes of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Praähistorische Bronzefunde Abteilung IX, 7.
