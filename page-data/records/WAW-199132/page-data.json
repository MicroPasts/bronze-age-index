The chisel is incomplete as the tang is missing. The blade is a elongated sub-triangle with concave sides and a convex blade edge. The corners of the blade are flared outwards and are abraded and therefore rounded. The blade as it tapers becomes rectangular in section. At the tip there is an integral rectangular sectioned collar with a fragment of the integral tang protruding from the upper edge. The break of the tang is not recent. There are no signs of decoratio.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the chisel has a incomplete well-developed mid green patina with some pitting and abrasion. \n\n\n\nDimensions: length 46mm; width across the blade 28mm; 5mm maximum thickness (at collar) and weight not recorded.\n\n\n\nTanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example, dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase, is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) probably continuing into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC). A similar tanged chisel was found in association with a large amount of Late Bronze Age material as part of a probable Early Iron Age hoard at Gussage St. Michael, Dorset (Knight, Ormrod & Pearce 2015: 51, no. 250b). Another similar example, from Kingston, Dorset, is published by Pearce (1984: 476, no. 416a), from a site which has also produced Late Bronze Age pottery. Numerous similar chisels are also recorded onto this database, but cf. WILT-CDB685 and DEV-C3AD9B, are particularly similar.","fourFigureLat":"52.28995744","fourFigureLon":"-1.28302718","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"February 01, 2018","datefound2":"May 11, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Grandborough","county":"Warwickshire","district":"Rugby","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW199132.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"46"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
