The fragment is sub rectangular in shape, and triangular in cross section. The socket is rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along one of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at the sides. The blade edge is damaged.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead fragment measures 22.7 mm in length, 53.0 mm wide (at the blade), 43.2 mm wide (at the body), 10.0 mm thick (at the body), 2.9 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 4.5 mm deep. It weighs 35.6 g.\n\n\n\nThe socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.\n\n\n\nPeter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) commented on a similar socketed axehead fragment (WMID-EB5248) that it is late BA rather than Middle - as in post Wilburton - Llyn Fawr phase (1150-750 BC). Almost all socketed axes are from the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC). This example is likely to be similar in dating.","fourFigureLat":"52.84005753","fourFigureLon":"-2.32804591","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Teresa Gilmore","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Teresa Gilmore","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"10","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Adbaston","county":"Staffordshire","district":"Stafford","regionName":"West Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/wmidaa5943.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"22.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
