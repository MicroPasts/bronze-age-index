The arrowhead has considerable abrasion and loss to the blade edges and tip, however it is clearly of triangular form. The cross sectional profile is flat, slightly elliptical but without a prominent midrib. The trapezoidal tang is splayed and relatively wide (6.5mm) compared to the overall width of the head (12.6mm).","fourFigureLat":"51.26202098","fourFigureLon":"-0.18119935","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-800","notes":"The only example of this type of bronze arrowhead from a securely dated archaeological context comes from the Penard hoard (c. 1275-1140 BC) and was published in Archaeologica 71 (p. 138). At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import on the basis of a range of previous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France. PAS recorded finds have since demonstrated that these bronze arrowheads were also a native British tradition, although they are very rare finds. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age, the Penard find suggests at least a Middle Bronze Age date for copper alloy examples such as this one which likely derive their shape from these earlier flint precursors.\n\n\n\nOther examples on the database include SWYOR-3A2CF7, NMS-B061B6, NMS-F982A3, WMID-CE6A76, NARC-F9B223, NMS-477E93 and SF6680. This is the first recorded example from Surrey.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simon Maslin","datefound1":"October 31, 2017","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simon Maslin","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"1.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Merstham","county":"Surrey","district":"Reigate and Banstead","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR4655A8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"20"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
