The awl is square in cross section along most of its length, and tapers to a rounded point at one terminal. At the other terminal it flattens to become rectangular, before ending in a chisel-shaped terminal.\n\n\n\nLength: 65.07mm, Width: 5.69mm, Thickness: 5.00mm, Weight: 7.0g\n\n\n\nThe metal is dark brown in colour with a predominantly smooth patina.\n\n\n\nCf. OXON-C4D536 on the database which states: Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Awls are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).","fourFigureLat":"51.86997649","fourFigureLon":"-0.57801354","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Ellie Cox","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Ellie Cox","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Eaton Bray","county":"Central Bedfordshire","district":"Central Bedfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC6437BE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"65.07"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
