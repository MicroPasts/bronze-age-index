The axe measures 161.6mm in length and 99.6mm across the blade. The butt measures 37.3mm. The thickness of the axe is 12.00mm. The sides are bevelled and the blade is slightly flat which may suggest a lot of sharpening. There is a little damage to the surfaces which are pitted and now have a slightly rough texture.\n\n\nThis fine axe belongs to the Migdale-Marnoch tradition of the early Bronze Age (named after two sites in Scotland).","fourFigureLat":"53.387213","fourFigureLon":"-0.40767","fromdate":"-2200","todate":"-1900","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"David W Williams","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"David W Williams","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"West Rasen","county":"Lincolnshire","district":"West Lindsey","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCN5214.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Surrey County Council","length":"161.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
