The fragment is sub-rectangular in shape and only the butt survives. The axe has an angular butt and the sides gradually widen towards the break. Both sides of the palstave have high developed flanges, which increase gradually from the butt to from sub-triangular sides. \n\n\n\nThe faces of the axe fragment are slightly concave, creating a H-shaped cross-section. There is a large casting flaw on one face, in the form of an air bubble. The bubble extends the entirety of the palstave's thickness, likely creating a point of weakness and contributing to the eventual break. The faces of the axe show signs of wear, such as scratches and the break is even and patinated, suggesting that the object was broken in antiquity. Due to the fragmentary nature of the object, it is difficult to confidently assign a Type. \n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 27.6 mm in length, 25.4 mm wide, 14.9 mm thick and weighs 25.4 g.","fourFigureLat":"51.01537053","fourFigureLon":"-1.95860828","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Caroline Chestnutt","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Caroline Chestnutt","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.9","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Broad Chalke","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILTA1ED33.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"27.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
