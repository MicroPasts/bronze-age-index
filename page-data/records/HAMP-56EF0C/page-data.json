It measures 25.7mm in length and weighs 21.47g.\n\nThe break is worn but possibly not ancient. This is the widest part of the fragment and is a horizontally-elongated H in cross-section, measuring 28.0mm wide and 14.4mm thick. The sides of the axe are triangular in shape, narrowing to the butt end which is 2.4mm thick and 24.2mm wide, having a slightly curved end edge.\n\nThe patina is smooth and shiny and blue-green in colour. At the break bubbles (from the casting process) are visible and running longitudinally along the centre is a slight step, probably a join-mark. There are some signs of tooling to the outside edges of the flanges, which are 3.6-3.8mm thick at their widest.","fourFigureLat":"51.16717945","fourFigureLon":"-1.50080082","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"July 17, 2015","datefound2":"July 17, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Generated from computer mapping software","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"14.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Goodworth Clatford","county":"Hampshire","district":"Test Valley","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP56EF0C.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Hampshire Cultural Trust","length":"25.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
