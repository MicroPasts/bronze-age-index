Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is at the end that tapers towards the tip or point, as any raised area has flattened out in section. The surface of the blade has more corrosion product and is more pitted on one face than the other, probably due to exposure. There are also gashes and later damage on both faces, which has happened since deposition. The fragment may be a result of deliberate decomissioning of a sword into separate pieces before it was ritually destroyed, or it may have been broken up in order to melt it down and re-use the metal. The two broken edges may also have been subsequently trimmed in order to re-use the weapon as a tool such as a razor or scraper.\n\n\n\nThe lozenge-shaped section of the blade without a defined central mid-rib suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.\n\n\n\nNeedham & Rohl (1998) illustrate two similar lozenge-shaped sections of Ewart Park swords on page 135, fig.37, nos.386-7.\n\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar section from a Ewart Park sword found at Cranborne in Dorset, on page 665, plate 104, no.365.\n\n\n\nKnight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate similar fragments of swords, from Lydford and Holne in Devon, on pages 98-99, plates 25-26, nos.145 & 136 (DEV-A6FA73), which are dated from the Ewart Park phase and the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"50.203855","fourFigureLon":"-5.30859056","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Philip Mitchell","datefound1":"September 13, 2015","datefound2":"September 19, 2015","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Philip Mitchell","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Camborne","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Dec15finds035.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"69.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
