Treasure case no. 2020 T2. Addenda to 2018 T5.\n\n\n\n1. (2020 T2-1) A complete gold penannular ring, circular in cross-section with flat terminals.15.0mm (outer diameter); 5.6mm (diameter in section); 2.0mm (maximum distance between the gap). Weight: 5.22g.\n\n\n\n2. (2020 T2-2) A fragment of a possible bracelet in use as an ingot, curved in profile and circular in cross-section. One end has been chopped twice obliquely producing a splayed 'V' shape. The other end has a single oblique chop. 16.9mm (length); 4.7mm (diameter); 6.5mm (width at larger end). Weight: 3.65g.\n\n\n\n3. (2020 T2-3) A complete copper-alloy gold plated penannular ring, circular in cross-section with flat terminals. 13.7mm (diameter); 3.9mm (diameter in section); 2.6mm (maximum distance between the gap). Weight: 5.62g.\n\n\n\n'The penannular rings belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange' (Mark Lodwick and Mary Davis in record NMGW-04216C; references therein).\n\n\n\nTaylor, JJ.
