The axe is of sub-rectangular section at the break and is worn and eroded (with a width of 37.6mm and a thickness of 9.8mm). The base of the socket is evident at the break (22mm long, 2.6mm wide and 3mm deep). One face of the axe was thicker than the other (4.0mm compared to 2.5mm). Little of the sides survive and no casting seams are now discernible. The blade edge has been lost but was curved (with a surviving width of 36.7mm). The original surface of the axe has largely been lost and the current surface is pale green and powdery, with active bronze corrosion. Small patches dark green patina survives on the faces.\n\n\nSocketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late   Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC although most recovered socketed axes   are of Ewart Park phase.","fourFigureLat":"51.646893","fourFigureLon":"-4.819928","fromdate":"-950","todate":"-750","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Simone-Louise Johnson","datefound1":"June 16, 2009","datefound2":"July 30, 2009","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Simone-Louise Johnson","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Manorbier","county":"Pembrokeshire","district":"Pembrokeshire","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2009.215.1i.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"19.1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
