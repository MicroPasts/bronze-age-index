The object is socketed; the core of the socket is filled with earth.  The blade is lozenge-shaped in section, with an ovoid-sectioned socket.  There is a small step between the socket and the blade.  Located on the socket, below the base of either of the cutting edges are perforations 6.2mm in diameter.  The thickness of the metal of the socket is 1.8mm.  The object resembles a Donington on Bain type spearhead.  Also, see the Thorndon class knives from the Petters hoard.  A second piece of this object was located 4 meters away from the main part.
