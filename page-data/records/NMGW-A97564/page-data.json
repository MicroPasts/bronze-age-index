The butt has been formed by hammering to thin the end (with a minimum thickness of 1.5mm) and to define a sub-triangular facet, with hammer-marks discernible on both faces. The sides of the butt have been hammered from the sides (giving a width of 16.7mm) and therefore the shoulders widen slightly to the blade (with a width of 19.6mm). There is no surviving evidence for any rivet-holes on the butt. The blade is of rounded, low-oval section (with a maximum thickness of 4.0mm before the butt). There is the suggestion of a weak mid-rib, discernible only on one face. The blade sides are convex (giving a maximum surviving width of 19.9mm). Concave blade facets (with a surviving width of 3.7mm) are evident and the blade edges have been lost. The dirk has good surface preservation with a mid to dark-brown patina. There are the remnants of an incised line marking the line of the blade facet and crossing before the tip, in one area there is the suggestion of a double-incised line.","fourFigureLat":"51.491714","fourFigureLon":"-3.470589","fromdate":"","todate":"","notes":"The blade fragment is comparatively substantial, possibly suggesting that the dirk may have been reworked from the tip of a sword with a leaf-shaped blade, or possibly from a heavy rapier. Incised decoration on blades tends occur on swords of the Penard Industry (e.g. Type Clewer and Type Limehouse) and on Group I dirks and rapiers.","materialTerm":"","identifier":"Mark Lodwick","datefound1":"January 01, 2007","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"","recorder":"Sian Williams","gridSource":"From a paper map","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Penllyn","county":"the Vale of Glamorgan","district":"the Vale of Glamorgan","regionName":"Wales","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.168.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"87.7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
