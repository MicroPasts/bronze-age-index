The fragment is triangular in section. A ridge to either side of the edge on both faces of the artefact begins to form shortly before the break. This is the beginning of the pocket into which the split end of the haft could be fitted. The remains of the axehead are 31 mm long and 27 mm wide. It is 8.8 mm thick at the widest end and 4.8 thick at the thinnest. The palstave axe was introduced in Britain shortly after its development in Europe in the mid 2nd millennium BC. They were in use in Britain until around 1000 BC. Complete examples are illustrated in Langmaid (1976, 45; 13).","fourFigureLat":"52.262115","fourFigureLon":"-1.151607","fromdate":"-1400","todate":"-1000","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Tom Brindle","datefound1":"September 30, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Tom Brindle","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.8","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Norton","county":"Northamptonshire","district":"Daventry","regionName":"East Midlands","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-D0AB16palstaveaxerev.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Northamptonshire County Council","length":"31"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
