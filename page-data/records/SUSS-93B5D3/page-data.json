The axehead has a facetted body, with one wider face which widens towards the blade and a flanking narrow facet to either side. The socket mouth is round with a square internal socket and there seem to be four casting jets which are visible on the mouth, but flattened. A small collar or moulded ridge is visible directly below the socket mouth and the socket mouth itself is quite rounded on the external surface. The casting lines on either side edge have been trimmed and flattened, but not smoothed. The loop is D-shaped in plan and bears the flattened casting line on its external edge. The blade end widens from the axehead body and flares slightly at the lower blade. The colour of the metal is overall grey-green, which indicates a higher tin content; areas towards the blade end exhibit a high bronze-coloured patina. There is a small hole on one face near the blade which may be due to a casting bubble; it seems to perforate through the face and into the socket. It measures an overall 108.4 mm long, 54.86 mm maximum width at blade, 35.64 maximum outer width at socket mouth; the internal diameter of the socket is 26.9 mm and the depth of the socket is approximately 88 mm. The axehead weighs 209 grams.\n\n\nBecause of the socket orientation within the axehead, which is back to front, this example may be a smaller derivative of Sompting type axes.  According to Bronze Age specialist Dot Boughton, the facets indicate that this axehead should be dated to the Late Bronze Age rather than the Early Iron Age, which more typically has ribs instead of facets (pers. comm. 6/2012).","fourFigureLat":"50.90229593","fourFigureLon":"-0.18103041","fromdate":"-900","todate":"-700","notes":"\nThis axehead was discovered within a short distance of Wolstonbury Hill, a well-known Bronze Age site. Within the axehead, cartridges were found which suggests perhaps that this object has been discovered previously and re-interred in nearby soil. It is therefore possible that this axehead comes directly from the Wolstonbury site. It was discovered by a Friend of Wolstonbury and reliquished to the Wolstonbury Trust for keeping as part of the collection.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stephanie Smith","datefound1":"May 03, 2012","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Claire Goodey","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Other chance find","parish":"CLAYTON","county":"West Sussex","district":"Mid Sussex","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS-93B5D3LBASocketedAxehead.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"108.4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
