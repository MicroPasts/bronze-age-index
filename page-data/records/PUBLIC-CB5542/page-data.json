The palstave has a U shaped shield-shaped pattern below the stop ridge on both sides of the palstave, which is concave, bordered on either side by the flange facets and with a central ridge in its middle. The cutting edge of the axe is convex and bevelled, while in section the piece is sub-lenticular and the blade is sub-triangular in plan view with convex flaring sides. At the middle of the depression below the stop ridge on the sides of the axe, the palstave has been slightly shouldered with two reasonably prominent ridges. The area of the axe comprising the stop-ridge and the butt with the septum in between is sub-triangular in section and sub-rectangular in plan-view, though at the upper edge of the axe this is irregular due to the breakage at the butt end. \n\n\n\nThe palstave survives well with a relatively even green patina except for some small losses to the cutting edge and to the extremities of the butt end. In some places, the patina is relatively pitted with some brown mineralised deposits visible in places. \n\nIt measures 152.65mm long from the broken end of the butt to the point of the blade, 30mm wide at the stop ridge, 28.65mm wide at the midpoint of the flange-facets and 23.18mm wide at the broken butt-terminal. The cutting edge of the axe is 56.86mm wide, and from the cutting edge to the stop-ridge the axe measures 85.81mm long. At the thickest point of the flange-facets the axe is 26.34mm thick and at the mid-point of the blade the axe is 12.68 mm thick. The axe weighs 488 grammes. \n\n\n\nThis palstave is comparable to nos. 146 and 151 in Savory's catalogue (Savory 1980, pp. 104-105) as well as LVPL-1FDB7C on the PAS database, which the recorder assigns to the primary phase of the Middle Bronze Age.","fourFigureLat":"50.93277801","fourFigureLon":"-0.42177696","fromdate":"-1550","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Alex Bliss as Finder","datefound1":"January 12, 2015","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Alex Bliss as Finder","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"26.34","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Ashington","county":"West Sussex","district":"Horsham","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abliss/unspecified50.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Sussex Archaeological Society","length":"152.65"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
