The fragment is broadly trapezoidal in plan with four unevenly worn edges. The upper edge is relatively straight and has a worn notch of damage towards one end. The adjacent edge has a short triangular recess and a long edge that extends outwards to the lower pointed corner. The opposite short edge has three unevenly spaced semi-circular recesses. The lower edge, meanwhile, is rounded and curves inwards before the break. An integral flange extending along approximately three quarters of this inside edge is broadly sub-triangular in cross-section and expands from what is otherwise the uneven sub-rectangular-sectioned wall.\n\n\n\nNone of the external or interior surfaces are decorated and all have uneven light green, light brown and dark brown patination.\n\n\n\nThe fragment measures 31.6mm in length, 23.5mm in width, a minimum of 3.3mm in thickness and a maximum of 9.3mm in thickness. The entire object weighs 15.56 grams.","fourFigureLat":"51.7434283","fourFigureLon":"-0.5240518","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-750","notes":"The finder reports that this was found within a few feet of BH-6F439A, which may or may not be related.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Matthew Fittock","datefound1":"September 01, 2021","datefound2":"September 01, 2021","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"9.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"Dacorum","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/UnidentifiedObject.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"31.6"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
