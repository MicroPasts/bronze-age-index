Only the tip of the axe survives consisting of a curved cutting edge with prominently flared sides. The base of the socket is visible where the body of the axe is broken and taper sin width towards the cutting edge. The remaining portion of the axehead is undecorated and the breaks are worn.\n\nThe metal has a dark reddish-brown patina and is worn. The axehead is 28mm long, 41.6mm wide, 8.3mm thick and weighs 14.6g.\n\n\n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1100 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"54.512189","fourFigureLon":"-1.831612","fromdate":"-1100","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Rebecca Griffiths","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Rebecca Griffiths","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"8.3","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wycliffe with Thorpe","county":"County Durham","district":"County Durham","regionName":"North East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/SR0108.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"York Museums Trust","length":"28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
