The fragment consists of the axe&#39;s blade above which is a worn and abraded break that reveals a shallow portion of the socket. The axe fragment is sub-trapezoidal in plan with the sides being slightly concave, particularly on one side as the tip of the blade is not abraded like the other.&nbsp;The blade is an asymmetrical crescent which is possibly due to wear rather than abrasion.\n\nThe broken edge of the axe runs transversely across its body giving a flat edge. In cross section the body of the axe is rectangular as revealed by the break. The cross-section perpendicular to the break is sub-triangular excluding the socket.&nbsp;The survivnig socket is only 12.73mm deep.\n\nThe axehead fragment is 28.68mm long from break to blade, 43.03mm wide, 12.59mm thick at its break and weighs 40.82&nbsp;grams.\n\nThe fragment represents part of the blade end of a rectangular bodied socketed axe. The lack of diagnostic features prevents a more exact type or parallel for the its form being cited however Socketed Bronze Age Axe are believed to date from the middle of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1300 cal&nbsp;BC) to the Earliest Iron Age (c.700/600cal&nbsp;BC).","fourFigureLat":"51.714684","fourFigureLon":"-1.30663148","fromdate":"-1300","todate":"-600","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"","datefound1":"March 01, 2022","datefound2":"July 20, 2022","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"12.59","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wootton","county":"Oxfordshire","district":"Vale of White Horse","regionName":"South East","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/ambolton/OXONB310BE.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Oxfordshire County Council","length":"28.68"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
