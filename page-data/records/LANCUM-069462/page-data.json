The fragment is roughly leaf-shaped with a flat diamond-shaped cross-section. The outside edges are largely missing. Part of the rectangular sectioned tang remains though most has broken off. There is no decoration on the surface. A smooth mid green patina survives in places but mud adhering to the faces obscures much of the surface. A fairly broad, flat rib can be seen on both faces, running from the tang towards the point of the blade. The length is 38mm, the width is 18mm, thickness 3.5mm and the weight 4.32g.

Representing the earliest form of copper-alloy razor, these varied in shape, starting initially with the handled examples which resembled spearheads (i.e. elongated triangular-edges, with one or two rivet holes at the base for affixing a handle. The tanged varieties were more leaf shaped, echoing the styles that came afterwards. The overall shape and size of these razors varied slightly across different regions of continental Europe, resulting in many different typologies and sub-categories.\"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Stuart Noon","datefound1":"April 07, 2013","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Undergoing further examination at a museum","recorder":"Stuart Noon","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"3.5","discoveryContext":"Controlled archaeological investigation (stratified)","parish":"Bolton-le-Sands","county":"Lancashire","district":"Lancaster","regionName":"North West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"","length":"38"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
