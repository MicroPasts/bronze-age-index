It is probably of Type Roundhay, mid-ribbed variant : the cutting edge has been moderately expanded and at the ancient break the body is narrow (20mm wide). The mid-rib is 5mm wide at the break and continues over 40mm at the same width on both faces.\nThe fragment is 61mm in length and the surviving cutting edge is 38mm wide. Its estimated original cutting edge width is 43mm. At the ancient break, the cross section is rectangular and measures 20x15mm. It is a clean, and therefore probably purposeful, break.\nOne face is extremely pitted and ever so slightly concaved in section, so it appears bent. The pitting may therefore have been caused by repeated hammer blows. On the opposite face is a deep roughly horizontal cut.\nNo original patina survives and the edge is worn. The fragment weighs 108.19g.\nTransitional palstaves date to the Penard phase, at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, c.-1250 to -1100 BC. Transitional palstaves had a single side loop.","fourFigureLat":"51.31191245","fourFigureLon":"-2.21659303","fromdate":"-1250","todate":"-1100","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Katie Hinds","datefound1":"February 24, 2005","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Katie Hinds","gridSource":"Centred on parish","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"15","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Trowbridge","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Palstave.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society","length":"61"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
