The butt (with a width of 21.8mm) is now corroded and of uncertain form. The flanges begin a little before the butt and were comparatively high (now damaged on one face), rising to their maximum height just behind the stop (with a maximum surviving height of 35.5mm). One of the flanges has an indentation, probably the result of a casting flaw. The septum (with a thickness of 7.3mm) is gently concave. The sides are straight and near-parallel, slightly divergent as far as the stop (where the palstave has a width of 25.8mm). The stops are near-straight and flat (with a height above the septum of (12.7mm and 12.2mm). The casting seams are discernible on the sides where the surface survives and have been neatly finished. To the front of the stops, the sides are concave and gradually increase in divergence to the blade. The blade is moderately expanded and the blade tips have been damaged (giving the blade a surviving width of 64.4mm). Both faces are decorated with the characteristic 'shield-pattern' (31mm long) defined by a depression and without a moulding. The faces are flat across their widths and most of the length, before curving to the blade but without a discernible blade facet. The surface has a dark brown patina with areas of dark-green surface loss.\n\n\n\nThe palstave may be seen as significant being of Acton Park type and found 2100m South East from[m1] the eponymous hoard (Savory 1980, no. 262, p 116)[2]. Acton Park palstaves are dated to 'Acton Park 1' with a suggested date in the 16th century BC (Needham 1996, p 133)[3], within Needham's (ibid.)
