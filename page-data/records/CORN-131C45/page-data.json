The surface of the ingot fragment is quite pitted and corroded, and generally light to dark green in colour, depending on how active the corrosion is, with patches of coppery red. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards dating from the Late Bronze Age (c.1150-700 BC), most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), the neighbouring parish, which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.\n\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular sections from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, PLate 36, No.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork, and an ingot fragment with similar dimensions from Churston Ferrers, Torbay on page 457, Plate 40, No.306b, which was found with a larger plano-convex ingot.","fourFigureLat":"50.075799","fourFigureLon":"-5.677208","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-700","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Anna Tyacke","datefound1":"January 10, 2013","datefound2":"January 10, 2013","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Anna Tyacke","gridSource":"GPS (from the finder)","quantity":"1","height":"25.4","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"25.4","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Sennen","county":"Cornwall","district":"Cornwall","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Jan13finds47.JPG","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Royal Institution of Cornwall","length":"60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
