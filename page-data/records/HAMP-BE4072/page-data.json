The edge opposite the terminal has a cross-section measuring 7.5 x 7.9mm. A paler gold strip or wire (possibly silvery-gold with some evidence of tarnishing, mostly on the inside of the ring) winds around the brighter gold surface of the object to give striped bands of equal size, c. 1mm wide.\n\nThe object measures 18.5mm in length, 19.8mm in width, 7.9mm in max.thickness (the side opposite to the terminal) and weighs 13.14g.","fourFigureLat":"51.10417592","fourFigureLon":"-1.48719648","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"'The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008).
