It consists of a copper-alloy core forming an incomplete loop which tapers slightly towards the terminals. One terminal has been damaged, exposing the core. The sheet gold plating exhibits banded decoration in the form of alternating stripes of gold and silvery-coloured metal, probably electrum.\n\n\n\nDiscussion: The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money'. \"Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange\" (Mark Lodwick and Mary Davis, in record NMGW-04216C / 2013 TW13; references therein).\n\n\n\nA number of similar examples have been reported as Treasure and are recorded on the PAS database, including PAS-011055 (2016T920), HAMP-1248F2 (2017T1157), SUSS-1CBAB0 (2017T984), SUSS-5EF5C1 (2017T350) and NMS-183C7E (2016T190).\n\n\n\nDate: c. 1150 - 800 BC.","fourFigureLat":"52.68668556","fourFigureLon":"1.60881354","fromdate":"-1150","todate":"-800","notes":"Any prehistoric artefact with any precious metal content whatsoever qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Julie Shoemark","datefound1":"July 29, 2018","datefound2":"July 29, 2018","subsequentActionTerm":"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","recorder":"Julie Shoemark","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"19","diameter":"20.5","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Martham","county":"Norfolk","district":"Great Yarmouth","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/jshoemark5/XXX_3E8DD8_MBA_PenannularRing_small.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
