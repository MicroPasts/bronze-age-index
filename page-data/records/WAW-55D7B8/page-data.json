The breaks across the blade are not old, but not too recent. The edges of the blade are slightly faceted and there are notches along the blade, which are not recent as the patina covers them.\n\n\n\nThe surface of the blade has a mottled dark green and brown patina.\n\n\n\nIt measures 29.87mm long, 23.49mm wide, 5.5mm thick. It weighs 16.63 grams.\n\n\n\nIt is probably a fragment from a sword or rapier of the Late Bronze Age date.","fourFigureLat":"52.52177586","fourFigureLon":"1.07920849","fromdate":"-1000","todate":"-800","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Angie Bolton","datefound1":"August 19, 2016","datefound2":"August 19, 2016","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Angie Bolton","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"5.5","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Wymondham","county":"Norfolk","district":"South Norfolk","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW55D7B8.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Birmingham Museums Trust","length":"29.87"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
