The centre of the object is narrowed with a convexly curved upper edge and is rounded and hollow underneath. A vertically aligned circular perforation extends through it. To either side is a tapering tear-dropped shaped element that is D-shape in cross-section and has rounded edges and pointed ends, one of which is broken with an old uneven break. These elements are flat on the underside and are attached to the central section via a step-down. The pronouncedly curved upper surface of the elements are decorated with a series of grooved striations along their length.\n\n\n\nThe object is 24mm long, 22mm wide and weighs 10 grams.\n\n\n\nThere is little dating evidence available for these enigmatic objects. An example was found with the Salisbury Hoard, indicating a Bronze or Iron Age date; the style might suggest an Iron Age date.\n\n\n\nSuch objects are of uncertain date but comparable objects recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database include NMS-A0C513, NARC-6A4546, LVPL-B000C6, HAMP-6F4C45, PUBLIC-E9E1C5, NARC-925E14, WILT-616785, KENT-77A0BF and SF-722CF5.","fourFigureLat":"51.9086067","fourFigureLon":"-0.12611729","fromdate":"-1600","todate":"40","notes":"Recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic with information and images provided by the finder.","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Dot Boughton","datefound1":"September 30, 2019","datefound2":"October 31, 2019","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Matthew Fittock","gridSource":"From finder","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Walkern","county":"Hertfordshire","district":"East Hertfordshire","regionName":"Eastern","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BHBD3AFC.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"The Portable Antiquities Scheme","length":"24"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
