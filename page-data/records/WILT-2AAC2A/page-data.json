It measures 119.72mm in length and 18.62mm in width and weighs 49.72g. The patina is smooth, dark brown in colour with patches of light green. After the slightly bent tip, there is a kite-shaped blade with slightly rough and jagged edges, which measures 62.7mm long and 18.62mm at its widest point. The central ridge runs down the centre of the blade, and blends seamlessly into the shaft of the spearhead. Underneath the blade on either side is decoration in the form of hatching; approximately seven horizontal linear grooves, which end at the loops. The casting seams on either side of the edge appear to have been trimmed and hammered flat. Running down from the hatching can be found a lozenge shaped undrilled loop, one either side, measuring about 22mm in length and 16.67mm in width. They sit approximately in the middle of the spearhead, between the blade and the open socket mouth. As the loops are undrilled, it is difficult to say how they could have been used to help attach the wooden shaft to the spearhead, or whether they were used as suspension loops for tassels or other forms of decorations. The open socket mouth is circular, measuring 16.78mm in diameter, and has a slightly recessed and jagged edge.","fourFigureLat":"51.41098869","fourFigureLon":"-2.08765783","fromdate":"-1500","todate":"-1150","notes":"","materialTerm":"Copper alloy","identifier":"Nina Dierks","datefound1":"Invalid date","datefound2":"Invalid date","subsequentActionTerm":"Returned to finder","recorder":"Nina Dierks","gridSource":"","quantity":"1","height":"","diameter":"","edge":null,"thickness":"","discoveryContext":"Metal detector","parish":"Lacock","county":"Wiltshire","district":"Wiltshire","regionName":"South West","country":null,"patina":null,"surface":null,"other":null,"composition":null,"associations":null,"publications":null,"inputBy":null,"imageURL":"https://finds.org.uk/images/flojohnstone/WILT2AAC2Al.jpg","flickrURL":null,"project":null,"rightCorner":null,"collection":null,"site":null,"toSearch":null,"gridRef":null,"dateDiscoveryDay":null,"dateDiscoveryMonth":null,"dateDiscoveryYear":null,"remarks":null,"museumCollection":null,"museumID":null,"collectionIdentifier":null,"stolenStatus":null,"imageCopyrightHolder":"Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum","length":"119.72"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1238893133","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
