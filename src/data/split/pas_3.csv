145073,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1450,-1050,"Two halves of a Middle Bronze Age side-looped spearhead of Greenwell and Brewis Type IV, now repaired as one. It is 110.2mm in length with a socket diameter of 17x15.7mm (one side is slightly squashed). The internal diameter is 13.8mm.

The blade is 'flame shaped' and c.68mm in length. Almost all the original edge is damaged, apart from at the very base of the blade. The widest point is just above this, at 19.9mm. It would originally have been c.23mm wide here.

The mid-rib, as an extension of the socket, extends to the tip. This has been bashed on both sides by a hammer-like object and dented the socket/ mid-rib. This is ancient, and probably contemporary. It is not possible to tell how far the socket extended as the finder has repaired the spearhead with a bronze pin in the socket to hold the two halves in place.

The loops are slightly lower than the mid-way point between base of blade and socket end. They are c.18mm in length and flattish on the outside, being max.3.5mm wide. The internal measurement is 5-6mm long and 1mm wide.

The socket end is a little damaged as well as being slightly squashed. The body of the socket displays several purposeful light incisions. The patina is shiny and dark green in colour. The object weighs 48.69g BUT this is inclusive of the bronze pin used to hold both halves together.

Dates probably to the Taunton and possibly Penard phases, c.1450 to 1150 BC, although they are known to turn up in hoards of the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age, to c.1050 BC.",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-09-30T23:00:00Z,,,,,,17,,110.2,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Pitton and Farley,SU1833,From a paper map,51.096028,-1.744333,WILT-4E7E04,,Dixon1006spear.jpg,Middle Bronze Age spear,Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Dixon1006spear.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/115994.jpg

145195,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed gouge, dating to the Late Bronze, between c. 1150 – c. 800 BC (length: 69mm; diameter at mouth 17.5mm; width at gouge end: 14.5mm; thickness at gouge end: 8mm; weight: 36.5g).

The gouge (used as a wood-working tool) is sub-rectangular in plan, with a circular and slightly flared socketed terminal at one end. At the opposing end, the curved blade edge is ‘C’ shaped in section with an elongated triangular or ‘V’ shaped groove on the upper surface of the gouge. This groove (length: 37mm) commences 33mm from the open socket and gradually increases in depth and width towards the blade terminal.  At 8.5mm below the open socketed mouth of the gouge, there is a single moulded ridge running across the artefact’s circumference.  There is a casting line still visible to the left and right down the length of the artefact and at either side of the triangular or V’ shaped groove, therefore clearly indicating that this artefact was cast in a mould. These casting lines interrupt the single moulded ridge below the socketed mouth.  Overall, the artefact is in a slightly worn but good condition with a dark brown patina. There does not appear to be any wood surviving in the socket of the gouge.

Two similar examples are illustrated in Watson, P, 1993, ‘Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums’, BAR British Series 233. One of these examples is decorated with ribbing (No. 72), and the second (No. 73) is undecorated.

Another similar example is illustrated in Smith, R, A, 1920, ‘British Museum: A Guide to the Antiquities of the bronze Age in the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities’, page 47, fig 33 amongst other finds that were also discovered at Heathery Burn Cave, co. Durham.  Although the gouge V-shaped recess is longer, there is a similar single moulded ridge below the open socketed mouth of the artefact.

According to Pearce, S, M in the 1983 publication ‘The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I’, page 43, socketed gouges ‘appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age’, although most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 – c. 800 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-09-25T23:00:00Z,,,,36.5,,17.5,8,69,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Swinfen and Packington,SK1405,From finder,52.642564,-1.794534,WMID-634197,,WMID-634197.JPG,"Bronze Age socketed gouge (front, side and back views)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-634197.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/116854.jpg

145242,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A slightly incomplete cast copper alloy socketed and side-looped spearhead (Davis Group 2), dating to the Late Bronze Age, between c. 1150 - c. 800 BC (length: 79.5mm; width at blade: 22mm; diameter at socket mouth: 15.5mm; weight: 47.5g).



This artefact is a leaf-shaped spearhead with the remains of a pointed tip. The blade wings to either side of the tapering midrib are incomplete and badly corroded, but their overall shape remains, with the blade wings to either side of the midrib measuring at 7mm in width and 2.5mm thick. The width of the midrib at the tip measures 4.5mm, which then expands to approximately 10.5mm where the blades to either side terminate. Additionally, the midrib is diamond-shaped in section where the blade wings appear to either side, but then expands outwards and continues in length to form a circular sectioned socket 35mm from where the blade wings terminate. At approximately 10mm below the blade wings, there are the remains of side-loops to either side of the socket, with a casting ridge also present either side and in line with these loops, indicating the casting manufacturing process. The circular socketed terminal is complete and still completely filled with earth. Overall, the artefact is in a worn and corroded condition with some areas of bronze disease, particularly on the blade wings and midrib. One side of the spearhead survives better than the other and there are still large areas where the original dark green patina remains.



Similar examples are illustrated in H N Savory's 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections', 1980, pages 112 & 175, fig 27, ref nos 227-229, which are all examples of socket-looped spearheads, found at Cadoxton-juxta-Neath, Glamorgan; Llanfair Clydogau, Cardiganshire and Llanerfyl, Montgomeryshire respectively.

145258,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed axehead (of probable 'Trehou' type), dating to the Late Bronze Age, between c. 1150 – c. 800 BC (length: 114mm; width at side loop: 35.5mm; thickness at socket mouth: 28mm; weight: 197.33g).

The long and narrow axehead is sub-rectangular in plan, with a triangular side section and a square socketed mouth.  Most of the original blade edge has corroded away, but the blade still has a distinctive curved blade that has tapered to a thin edge.  The axehead tapers outwards from the blade to form the triangular section.  At approximately 79.5mm from the blade edge and 11.5mm from the scoketed mouth, there is a rounded/ arched cast copper alloy side loop (length: 21.5mm; width: 5.5mm; inner length of the loop: 10.5mm) integral to the main body of the axehead.  Additionally, the axehead is decorated by two parallel recessed ridges (approximate length: 3mm) immediately below the socketed mouth.  The first ridge commences 5mm below the mouth of the socket and there is a gap of 5mm again between the first and second ridge.  The second ridge is interrupted by the top terminal of the side loop.  The square socketed mouth is complete although worn along the edges.  Importantly, there is a substantial amount of wood surviving inside the socket (length of remaining wood: 48.5mm; diameter: 15mm; weight: 1.81g), which is now in a completely dry state and is strained green, presumably from being inside the copper alloy axehead for a long period of time.  Overall, the axehead, although worn, corroded, pitted and with very little of the original light brown patina remaining, is in a fair condition, particularly due to a large amount of wood surviving inside the socket.

145721,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Copper alloy low-flanged axe.



This bronze Early Bronze Age flanged axe has a long slender body with near parallel sides, which suddenly expand widely, to produce a crescentic shaped blade and asymmetric cutting edge. The butt end of the axe has been slightly damaged in antiquity and therefore the original shape is not apparent. Part way down the body of the axe is a median bevel, whilst the sides of the axe are rounded. Surface pitting on these sides precludes the possibility of knowing whether or not they were once decorated. Both faces of the axe were once decorated, although most decoration has been removed from one face by surface corrosion. On the well preserved surface there is ripple ornament executed by hammering, over which a complex design has been incised. Immediately beneath the median bevel is a narrow zone of herringbone, followed by four lines of infilled chevrons, parallel to the rippling and the cutting edge of the blade. This is succeeded by four lines of herringbone and then four lines of infilled chevron. Bordering this is a further chevron line, this time infilled in reverse to the other chevrons. This is finally bounded by a line of herringbone, which stops 24mm above the blade edge. This decoration is largely complete, although a small part has been removed by surface pitting at the blade end. Straitions on the original surface near the cutting edge indicates some sharpening of the blade occurred. The axe has a dark green patina, with lighter green surfaces within the areas of pitting. The axe has evidently been coated with a varnish or lacquer, as indicated by its lustre. Blade width 73.2mm, butt width 25.3mm, maximum length 149.0mm, maximum thickness (including flanges) 15.6mm, maximum depth of flanges 2.0mm, distance of median bevel from butt end 61.5mm and weighs 370.8g.","This artefact may be identified as a bronze flanged axe of Needham's (1983) Class 5, equivalent to Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Type Arreton, belonging to period 4 of the British Early Bronze Age and dating to between 1700-1500calBC (Needham et al 1985; Needham 1996). These are the first true flanged axes, used at the same time that tanged spearheads, Camerton-Snowshill daggers and Collared Urns were in circulation. Parallels for this axe within the National Collections are examples from the Ebnal and Menai Bridge Hoards, which both possess bands of short incision decoration below the bevel to the blade (Savory 1980, Cat. Nos.259 and 260). Comparable decoration of hatching and chevrons can be observed on examples from White Horse Hill (Osmington), Dorset, and Stuntney, Cambridgeshire (Needham 1983, Fig.58, Ds 5, Ca 13).

Migdale axes lack features such as median bevels, raised edges and the narrow straight-sided form frequently associated with decoration (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35)/  Attempts to subdivide the type on the basis of variation in form have been unsuccessful; graphs plotting indices of shape such as length, width and the ratios of the body width at various points along the length of the axe do not show  discrete concentrations (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35).  The Caswell bay example is closely paralleled by the example from Glangwenlais Quarry, llandybie, Carmarthenshire (Savory 1962-64; Savory 1980, 101 no.112 fig. 17).

147156,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"This bronze casting jet represents the by-product of the manufacture of a socketed axe.  The jet is of a roughly circular form and displays all four runners.  The four runners together with its geographic location strongly hint at the jet being removed from an axe of type Storgursey or 'South Wales Type'.  The patina on the casting jet varies from a brown to light green and the jet now displays a sheen due to polish or lacquer applied by the finder.  The external diameter of the jet is 39.2mm - 45.3mm, with an internal diameter of 16.4mm - 19.3mm.  The jet has a maximum thickness of 15.6mm.  The distance between the runners is 31.6mm and 29.5mm, implying an axe of usual proportions around its mouth, possibly with a square socket.  The jet has a weight of 52.1g.","The casting jet can be securely ascribed to the Ewart Park tradition of metalworking, belonging to Needham's (1996) metalworking stage 7.  For some time it has been realised Stogursey axes can be placed at the end of the Bronze Age and this has recently been varified by Needham et.al (1997), making it possible to place production between 950-750 cal. BC.
This find represents the only complete example of a casting jet with four runners in Wales the author is aware of.  The nearest welsh parallels are the jet associated with the St. Mellons hoard, Cardiff and a possible example from Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais.  In Needham's (1981) catalogue of Stogursey axes he lists seven examples, six of which are associated with the Stogursey Hoard, the other is from Lelant, Cornwall.  Evans (1881) records another from Kenidjack Cliff, Cornwall, associated with socketed axes.
It has been noted elsewhere (needham 1981, Brigs and Williams 1995, Northover) the discrepency between the majority of finds of Stogursey axes in South East Wales and stone molds from Southern England.

148063,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1150,"Cast incomplete copper alloy socketed chisel, wedge-shaped in profile and sub-rectangular in plan, with sub-parallel sides. The sides, when looking at the face of the chisel, are slightly concave along the length, curving outwards towards the blade. The chisel is a light to dark green colour and heavily corroded and pitted. The blade has a curved edge which is worn, and fragments of the edge have been broken off in the past, but it appears to mainly follow the original edge with no flaring of the tips. There are scars on both faces that are probably the result of plough damage. The hollow interior is cone-shaped, with the socket ending 20 mm up from the blade. The cross-section of the chisel is sub-rectangular with the walls ranging from 2.5 mm to 2.8 mm in thickness. The chisel is missing its butt end and was probably about 70-80 mm in length originally. The shape and curve of the blade suggest that this might have been a tool for carving wood, with the rounded edge enabling the carver to work with a concave area. The angle of the bevel, at about 20°, would have made it ideal for fine work where thin slivers of wood were being removed. Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar example on page 132, No.175, which is dated to the Penard period, c.1300-1150 BC.

The artefact has a flat shaped butt end, which tapers in section.  Unusually, the butt end of the axe is pierced by a circular hole (6mm in diameter).  This was made with care in antiquity, possibly by drilling into the metal with a circular implement from each side of the artefact, the hole breaking through the middle (as suggested by its slightly hourglass shaped profile).  The hole is slightly offset from the centre of the butt, and begins 9mm from the butt end.  The axe has a pitted surface appearance with a brown and black coloured iron rich encrustation on the surface, probably deriving from the burial environment of the artefact.  Metallic Bronze is revealed in small areas along the flange top on one side of the implement.

This is an undecorated Type Derryniggin flanged axe belonging to the Inch Island-Derryniggin metalwork tradition of the Early Bronze Age (Harbison 1969).  It can be assigned to Period 4 and Metalwork Assemblage 6 of the British Bronze Age, dating from 1700-1500cal BC (Needham 1996).","Parallels for this flanged axe have been found at Bryn Coch, Blaenrhonddan, Neath (Savory 1980, Cat.No.121) and Margam, Neath-Port Talbot (Savory 1980, Cat.No.122).  The characteristic metalwork products of this period were flanged axes, tanged and end looped spearheads and Camerton-Snowshill daggers (see Burgess 1980).  These are rare in Wales however, by comparison with Inch Island products in Ireland and Arreton products in southern and eastern England (Burgess and Cowen 1972).  It is possible that the axe was made within Wales, as the product of a small scale metalworking centre, and this is a question which might be approached through metallurgical analysis of the impurities within this bronze artefact.  During the past fifteen years copper mines have been found in Wales, and dated to the Early and Middle Bronze Age, using radiocarbon dating method, and therefore a Welsh source is a possibility.

The reason for piercing the object at the butt end is not immediately clear, and is a rare occurance on comparable flanged axes of this date.  The hole may have been associated with the securing of the haft to the blade, have been used for suspension in some way, or pierced as a deliberate act prior to its deposition.",4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,1999-06-25T23:00:00Z,,,,111.5,,,13,96.5,1,Adam Gwilt,Sian Williams,Wales,Swansea,Swansea,Mumbles,SS6390,From a paper map,51.59214348,-3.97911853,NMGW-EF8FC1,,,,,,,

The palstave axehead is sub-rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in section.  The septum end (length: 47mm; width: 21.5mm; thickness: 9.5mm) of the axehead is incomplete (the butt is completely missing) with a V-shaped break which is visible from the planned view of the artefact.  The septum also has flange facets that protrude upwards by approximately 5mm along the outside edge to the left and right and to either side of the artefact.  The protruding stop (width of the artefact at the stop: 21.5mm; thickness: see above), which when complete, would have been positioned halfway down the palstave, is more prominent on one side in comparison to the other (height of the stop on the prominent side: 14mm). Below the stop on the blade end of the artefact, there is a slight dished and small shield-shaped recess particularly visible on one side of the axehead.  The blade splays outwards towards the curved blade tip (see width above) with none of the original cutting edge remaining. The triangular sectioned blade tapers from a thickness of 19mm at the stop to 4.5mm immediately before the blade tip.  There is no evidence of a side loop on the artefact.  Overall, the palstave axehead is in a worn and corroded condition with none of the original patina remaining.  There are also small areas of bronze disease, which are particularly visible at the side flanges and stop on one side of the artefact only.

151290,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2300,-2050,"Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe of uncertain type, possibly of Type Dunnottar and of Metalwork Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 2, c. 2,300 - 2,050 BC. The axe has an overall length of 106.95mm and weighs 176.7g. The butt has suffered some damage, but is narrow and short with a surviving width of 16mm and would have been rounded or possibly even pointed. The sides are straight and diverge gradually to the unexpanded blade. The sides are rounded across their thickness, giving the axe an oval section. The blade has a width of 59.04mm and has a shallow blade edge. The narrow butt, straight sides and shallow edge produce a markedly triangular form to the axe. The faces are gently convex, producing a moderate lenticular long profile. The axe is thickest around its midpoint at 10.02mm. The axe has poor surface preservation with a pale brown patina, areas of the sides and faces have active corrosion.","Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency and to make the analyses comparable with other results. Results obtained suggest the axe is made of bronze and is broadly consistent with Early Bronze Age metal types. Metallurgical sampling of the axe would provide greater accuracy on the metallurgical composition. The triangular axe form with straight sides diverging to the unexpanded blade edge would not be consistent with the more common Migdale axe type. Dunnottar axes are typologically midway between copper and bronze axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, p 31) .",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,176.7,,,10.02,106.95,1,Sian Williams,Sian Williams,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Kington Rural,SO3055,From a paper map,52.188781,-3.02537071,NMGW-4634E0,,2006102.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006102.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629382.jpg

The axe is comparatively small with an overall length of 59.50mm and a weight of 62.4g. The incomplete mouth would have been sub-rectangular (36.32mm x 25.3mm). The remnants of the three casting stubs are evident on the three remaining sides of the mouth, demonstrating the axe was produced using four-runner casting technology. The socket has a depth of 39.5mm. The cornice-like mouth moulding or collar has a length of 7.5mm. The slender loop springs from beneath the base of the collar. The sides are straight and diverge slightly before the blade to produce a slightly expanded blade edge. The remnants of the casting flashes are prominent on the sides, and have been finished, probably by hammering. The sides are slightly bevelled towards the centre, producing a slightly hexagonal body profile. The blade edge is poorly preserved and has a width of 38.05mm. Both faces were decorated with three ribs, beginning at the base of the collar and continuing for c. 30mm. The ribs are convergent on the holed face and appear to be parallel on the face with the damaged mouth. The sides of the faces are pronounced suggesting additional ribs. Light sharpening striations are discernible running perpendicular to the blade edge. The surface of the axe is well preserved and has a mid-brown patina. Orange discolouration around the loop is likely to be the result of mineral staining. The damage to the axe is not consistent with its use and does not appear to be the result of casting problems. There is the suggestion that the holed face bows outwards at the base of the hole and that the other face may bend in slightly, perhaps suggesting a sharp implement was forced through both faces.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,62.4,,,,59.5,1,Sian Williams,Sian Williams,Wales,Newport,Newport,Marshfield,ST2583,From a paper map,51.540895,-3.082838,NMGW-E97AE5,,2006110.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006110.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629386.jpg

The fragment represents the lower part of the blade and the upper part of the socket. The point, blade, and lower socket (with associated string-like loops) are missing. Therefore, accurate dimensions of the spears length and width cannot be given. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an irregular cross section. The top of the fragment consists of the upper part of the central rib and is lozenge shaped in cross section; the spearhead expands towards the base of the socket where it is sub-circular in cross section. The base of the socket has been damaged and broken; the internal diameter is approximately 18.7 x 18.2mm. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The fragment measures 54.4mm lengths, has a maximum width of 14.4mm and maximum thickness of 10.3mm. The depth of the socket is 24.1mm. The spearhead weighs 12.86 grams. 

The spearhead is a mid-brown green colour with a relatively complete polished patina that covered all surfaces. This patina has been abraded in several areas and there are a few pock marks from corrosion on the socket. There are also a number of patches of light green powdery corrosion present. As mentioned above the blade of the spearhead is missing. This damage is relatively old as the breaks are worn and abraded. It is suggested that this spearhead fits with similar looped spearheads dated to the Middle Bronze Age, unfortunately the lack of diagnostic features on this examples means that a more detailed and accurate date cannot be achieved.",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,12.86,,,10.3,54.4,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,East Midlands,Leicestershire,Hinckley and Bosworth,Market Bosworth,SK4003,Centred on village (which isn't a parish),52.623297,-1.410546,HESH-29C652,,HESH-29C652.jpg,Bronze Age: Socketed Spear,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-29C652.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/191930.jpg

155792,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast bronze palstave axehead with possible stumped remains of a side loop, dating to the Middle Bronze Age between 1500 - 1150 BC (length: 157mm; width at blade tip: 65.5mm; thickness at flange side: 34.5mm; weight: exceeds the weight limit of 250g).

The palstave axehead is sub-rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in section at the flanges. The septum end (length: 61mm; width: 28.5mm) of the axehead is incomplete with an incomplete butt due to corrosion and a irregular break at the terminal. The septum also has incomplete and corroded flange facets that protrude upwards by approximately 10mm (measured where the flanges are mostly complete) along the outside edge to the left and right and to either side of the artefact. The protruding stop (width of the artefact at the stop: 26mm; thickness: 29.5mm; height of stop to either side: 12mm) is positioned nearly halfway down the palstave.  Below the stop on the blade end of the artefact, there is a slightly dished shield-shaped recess (length of recess: 28.5mm; width: 23.5mm) with raised outer borders on both sides of the axehead, as well as a central protruding ridge running down the centre and beyond this feature (length of central ridge: 54.5mm).  These markings can be described as a ‘trident patterned rib’.  The blade splays outwards towards the curved blade tip (see width above), although none of the original cutting edge remains due to several breaks and areas of bronze disease. The triangular sectioned blade tapers from a thickness of 28.5mm at the stop to 7mm immediately before the blade tip.  Additionally, there is a single and central casting ridge (as a result of the manufacturing process) down the length of either side of the artefact.  Overall, the palstave axehead is in a worn and corroded condition with substantial areas of the original dark brown patina remaining on both sides. There are small areas of bronze disease, which are particularly visible at the butt, side flanges and blade edge of the artefact.

Similar examples with a trident patterned rib are illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', pages 8 & 13, ref no 46 & 125, which were found in the Wolverhampton area and Co. Antirm, Ballymoney respectively.

Other similar side looped examples with trident patterns are also illustrated in Savory, H, N, 1980, ‘Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections’, pages170-1, ref nos 167 & 176, found at Llysworney, Glamorgan and Tyncochtery, Montgomeryshire respectively.  Savory also details a hoard from Mynydd Tal-y-glannau, Cemmaes, Montgomeryshire, which contains a number of ‘trident patterned’ axes (page 46).

The collared chisel can be paralleled with a late Middle Bronze Age example found at Rhys Flintshire (Savory 1980, No 224 Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections in the National Museum of Wales Cardiff).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-07-31T23:00:00Z,2006-08-31T23:00:00Z,,,11.5,,,5.38,38.98,1,Peter Reavill,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Wychavon,Hampton Lovett,SO8967,,52.30101,-2.162733,WAW-F5FF52,,WAW-F5FF52.jpg,"Bronze Age: chisel (plan, profile and reverse).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-F5FF52.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/127375.jpg

162079,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1300,"Cast copper alloy blade from a palstave, or Middle Bronze Age axe, which would have had built up sides and a stop ridge where the broken end is now, to stop the wooden haft or handle from slipping down the blade. The casting seams still remain on both sides of the blade. The axe seems to have been poorly cast as it looks quite porous at the broken end of the blade, and the stop ridge end has also been hammered in antiquity.

""The axe may be unused having been broken during the late stages of manufacture, or perhaps when someone first tried to use it. When you cast a palstave there is a tendency for the septum to freeze before the much thicker centre section. Hot metal can no longer feed into that area which then suffers a lot of shrinkage; as it is the last area to freeze any dross and other debris ends up in that area too. The analysis gave a high tin bronze (15.7% tin) which is much to be expected either side of the Channel at that time. The blade is as-cast and it is rather more usual to find whole or broken imported palstaves in that state than more locally produced ones. I would guess that it came from the north coasts of the Armorican peninsula to as far east as the Cotentin in France."" (Report by Dr. Peter Northover, Dept. of Materials, Oxford) 

From its style and thickness, it probably dates from the Taunton phase, c.1400-1300 BC.

The blade is 82 mm long and 59 mm wide and 3 mm thick at the cutting edge and 22 mm wide and 19 mm thick at the butt or stop ridge end.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-02-01T00:00:00Z,2007-02-19T00:00:00Z,,,192.38,,,19,82,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Blisland,SX0973,From finder,50.52553,-4.696057,CORN-CA0B11,,palstave blade.jpg,Bronze Age palstave blade (face),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/palstave blade.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/139997.jpg

The socket is cone-shaped in plan and in profile and square in section with a moulded ridge around the base of the socket. The casting seams remain on either side of the socket. The patina is good, but there has been some previous corrosion which has been professionally removed. There is also a faint mark in ink along one of the seams which may be an accession number or site reference, possibly LINC or LNC. The blade is 73 mm long, 22.5 mm wide and 3 mm thick and the socket is 55 mm long, 20.5 mm wide and 3.4 mm thick. This knife comes from a class of socketed knives made during the Late Bronze Age and thought to be used for woodworking, especially hollowing out. There are about ten of these that have been published in the British Isles and the majority come from Scotland. There are also a couple of examples in northern France. &quot;I had to examine these Scottish finds recently and can verify that they are like straight-bladed socketed knives; a bent spearhead from Bai&otilde;es in Portugal is at first glance similar. In this case, the asymmetrical position of the blade suggests it was intended to be bent, since straight blades are symmetrical with the socket&quot; (Brendan O&#39;Connor pers comm). Evans, J. (1881) illustrates similar examples in Ancient Bronze Implements of Britain and Ireland on pages 209-10. Coles, J. (1959-60) illustrates similar examples in Scottish late Bronze Age metalwork: typology, distributions and chronology in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland 93 on pages 46 &amp; 87.

The flange facets, which are both complete and give the artefact a lozenge-shaped appearance to the side, are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by.  The butt of the axehead is slightly rounded in plan. On both sides of the axe are partially visible linear scars / ribs which extend from the butt to the cutting edge. These have been trimmed and possibly hammered. It is likely that these scars are the remnants of the two part mold used to cast the artefact.  There are a couple of bubbles at the butt of the axe, which also indicate the casting process.

The axe is sub-triangular in plan with a narrow rounded butt that is 9mm wide, the sides expand in evenly to the cutting edge which is 49mm wide, the blade is slightly convex in shape with a prepared cutting edge which has been eroded / abraded in the soil. The blade bevel is slight. When viewed in profile the axe is lentoid (elongated oval).There is no evidence of development such as a median bevel or raised side flanges. The original patina of the axe is mostly lost through corrosion and lamination. The metal revealed is a light green colour with a dusty patina. In places small elements of possible decoration can be seen; this includes small punched depressions on the upper and lower faces - along the edge, and cabling along the long sides. These areas indistinct due to the abrasion. The axe fits with some of the earliest metal artefacts found in Britain, possibly associated with the Migdale Metalworking tradition. This would date it as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.


The Axe measures length 74mm, width 49mm, thickness 8mm weight 118.4 grams.

These items are said to date from the mid-late Bronze Age up to the Iron Age.  The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval and is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item which come to a halt about half way along the full length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated.  The patina is primarily deep brown but patches of invasive corrosion have caused a loss of this outer surface.  The interior of the object has a light green corrosive covering.

Due to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete but based on other known examples (e.g. SF9183) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original.  The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle with a hole through the centre of this bridge.  This form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings.  The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion.

This item measures 29.62mm in length, has a maximum width (side to side of the 'bowl' opening) of 12.82mm and a width (from front to back of the 'bowl' shaped section)of 11.89mm.

The mouth would have been sub-rectangular in plan. The surface is worn and pitted, especially along the casting seams, but there is a layer on one face that remains so that three ribs are still visible, between the side edges of the axe head. The ribs extend down about three quarters of the length of the body of the axe head, and the central rib is more pronounced and appears to be the longest. Half of the other face is missing, and has exposed the organic material still held within the axe. The sides of the body of the axe are parallel until they reach the blade which is slightly flanged.

183469,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1150,400,"Late Bronze Age to Roman copper alloy 'model' (Robinson, Wiltshire Archaeology Magazine 1995) or possibly miniature socketed axehead, with traces of iron in the shallow socket (9.2x5.6x3mm). 

It measures 38.5mm in length and has a cutting edge max. 24.8mm wide. At the socket end (narrowest part) it is 16.8mm wide. It weighs 31.28g.

The axehead is thinnest at the blade end (1.1mm thick) expanding over the length to 12.7mm at the socket end.

The mouth has a slight moulding which is emphasised by a groove beneath it. The loop is cast to the side (and not part of the body of the axe as so many miniature example are) and is C-shaped (8.7x7mm) with a piercing 2.6mm in diameter.

The surface of the miniature axe has lost some of its original patina, although it is mostly smooth and shiny and dark in colour. There is no sign of wear on the loop(suggesting it was not worn as an amulet).

The dating of miniature axeheads is from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period, although they are more common from the Roman period. Their function is probably as an amulet or votive. This axehead is unlike those recorded from Wiltshire so far, which are mostly crude interpretations, whereas this is much more faithful to a true Bronze Age axe. That said however, it is very flat in section and its splayed blade is rather more reminiscent of palstave axeheads than socketed ones. The socket and loop are rather more Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park types.

Robinson comments in WAM 1995 that better-made examples could be used as tools of some sort. He comments on this particular object: ""To my mind this is a classic ""model"" but not miniature axehead. They are always much better made than the miniature axeheads. The example we have in Wiltshire Heritage Museum is 51 mm long which is close enough to yours at 38.5. I had thought that they were Late Bronze Age but could never find strong dating evidence for them"".

The axe is near-complete, missing only the loop and has a length of 86.9mm and has a weight of 146.2g. The mouth is comparatively square with an external width (between sides) of 37.0mm (27.9mm internal) and breadth (between faces) of 34.1mm (25.8mm internal). The socket has a depth of 72.4mm with no evidence of internal ribs. The mouth is uneven and appears to have had a prominent rounded mouth moulding. The axe has a weaker moulding beneath the mouth. The loop springs from the top of the lower moulding, and had a length of 22.2mm. The sides of the axe are straight and parallel, until they approach the blade, where they diverge to produce a moderately expanded blade edge. The blade edge is moderately curved with a slightly eroded width of 36.0mm. The unlooped side has a slight angle across its thickness and the casting seam is just about evident. There is no discernible decoration on the faces. The axe currently has much of the surface surviving with a mid brown patina. The surface however is deteriorating and is powdery to the touch with areas of active bronze corrosion beneath.","South Eastern type axes are often associated with the Carp's Tongue complex of North West France (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 217), which heavily influences hoard composition in Lowland England.

187893,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed axe, dating to the Late Bronze Age, between 1150 – 800 BC (length: 87.5mm; width at blade: 45.5mm; width at socket: 36.5mm; thickness: 39.5mm; weight: 166.57g).  This artefact could be further classified as dating from the Ewart Park phase, between 1000 – 800 BC.

The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a hollow triangular section.  At one end of the artefact, the open socket is square with a moulded and lipped edge protruding outwards from all four sides.  The inside of the socket is completely empty.  To either side and immediately below the lipped top of the axe, there are three vertical ribs protruding upwards on each face, with four alternating recessed indentations.  Each rib is approximately 33.5mm in length and 3.5mm in width.  Additionally, each rib tapers inwards slightly as they continue down the artefact’s length whilst becoming less prominent and worn as they seem to blend in with the axe’s expanding blade.  To one side of the artefact, there is a single and integrally cast copper alloy loop (length of loop: 24mm; width of loop: 11mm; thickness of loop: 9mm; length of oval loop hole: 8.5mm; width of loop hole: 5.5mm).  The blade tip curves outwards along the outside edge to either side of the artefact with the blade’s cutting edge still intact.  Additionally, a prominent casting seam is visible down the length of the axe’s sides, running from the lipped open socket to the blade tip.  Although this artefact does appear to have been possibly coated in a substance, the axe is in a slightly worn but good condition with a very dark brown patina.  Some areas of the artefact (near the blade) have small patches where the original patina has corroded and there is a probable scrap/ scratch on the artefact’s side.

The artefact is sub-triangular in plan and is mostly flat in section. The butt and shoulders of the dirk are incomplete with the top completely missing. One rivet holes is partially visible to one side, although two rivets would have been originally visible to the left and right when the artefact was complete. The sides of the blade below the shoulders curve/ taper inwards to start form the blade, where the slightly bevelled edges are still visible on both sides of the artefact. The dirk breaks prematurely at the opposing end, although the artefact would not have continued in length for much longer when complete. Overall, the dirk is in a worn, corroded and pitted condition with a patchy dark green patina. There are numerous pits on the patina all over the artefact and much of the corrosion is present at the blade edges and broken tip.

190313,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard comprising of 3 cast copper-alloy socketed axe-heads, a 2-part cast copper-alloy axe casting mould, 6 pieces of bronze metal working casting debris and 2 associated but later (Medieval-Post Medieval) copper alloy fragments.

Axe 1: South eastern type Class A2 (Ewart Park Phase c.1000-800BC).  The shape of the mouth is a rounded square.  It has a double mouth mouldings with a single side loop extending from the lower less pronounced moulding.  The body is parallel sided with slight flaring towards the cutting edge.  The casting seams are clearly evident down both sides of the axe and the cutting edge is fresh and undamaged. The axe has a single slightly pronounced rounded pellet in the centre of each face just below the lower mouth moulding, apart from this the axe is plain.

The axe measures 109.67mm in length, the blade is 45.24mm wide.  The external diameter of the mouth (from side to side) is 40.09mm & the internal diamter is 27.60mm, the external diameter of the mouth (front to back) is 43.14mm & the internal diameter 31.20mm.  The length of the side loop is 23.65mm and it is 9.72mm thick.  The axe weighs 287.45g.

Axe 2: The description is exactly the same as above.

The axe measures 110.37mm in length, the blade is 45.47mm wide.  The external diameter of the mouth (from side to side) is 40.19mm & the internal diamter is 28.83mm, the external diameter of the mouth (front to back) is 41.72mm & the internal diameter 30.04mm.  The length of the side loop is 24.42mm and it is 10.10mm thick.  The axe weighs 275.21g.

Axe 3: The description is exactly the same as above.

The axe measures 109.16mm in length, the blade is 44.93mm wide.  The external diameter of the mouth (from side to side) is 39.70mm & the internal diamter is 28.89mm, the external diameter of the mouth (front to back) is 42.36mm & the internal diameter 30.47mm.  The length of the side loop is 24.77 and it is 10.15mm thick.  The axe weighs 289.67g.

The 2-Part Axe Casting Mould: The mould completely matches the form, size & shape of the above 3 axes and it is therefore fair to say that this mould was used for the casting of these items.

The mould has a 'tongue & groove' design around the main axe impression allowing the two pieces to be closely slotted together during casting.  There is a slight negative surface flaw evident on the internal face of one of the moulds (along the lower blade portion) but this is not seen on the 3 axes and was presumably filed or polished during post-casting axe preparation.  The remains of a failed casting can be seen in the upper portion of one half of the  mould and this is now a pale white-yellow in colour.  The exterior of one half of the mould is decorated with two long irregular linear ridges and one shorter ridge between.  Below this shorter central ridge is a small raised rounded pellet and below this a small depression.  The other half of the mould purely has a smaller central rounded pellet for decoration.  Projecting from the lower perimeter edge of one half is a slight semi-circular flange.

The mould and axes have a rich mid brown patina with some superficial surface pitting/porosity and slight surface scratches probably acquired in recent years.

The Mould with remnant casting measures 151.04mm long and is 63.92mm at its widest point.  It was not possible to weight the item (in excess of 300g)

The second mould piece measures 152.60mm in length and 64.76mm at its widest point.  It was not possible to weight the item (in excess of 300g)


Bronze Metalwork Casting Debris:  There are 6 pieces of copper-alloy casting debris that were found in close association with the hoard.  The debris has bright green corrosion but is brown-orange in colour overall.  It is dense and heavy in relation to its size and has the typical 'bubbled' appearance of casting waste.  The waste measures: 118g, 225g, 86g, 133g, 266g & 255g.

Two additional pieces of copper-alloy metalwork were also presented with the hoard but due to their form and correlation have been deemed Medieval to Post-Medieval in date with the larger of the two being a probably leg for a Medieval cooking pot c.1500s whilst the smaller item is unidentifiable in its current condition.","This hoard was reported in retrospect as discovered during the later 1980s and is therefore not subject to the Treasure Act of 1996 under which such a hoard would now be classified as Treasure.

This Hoard was recorded at the request of Oxfordshire Museums Service after it was seen for sale (with local provenance) at an Oxon Antiques Shop near Chipping Norton.

The palstave belongs to the Acton group of metalwork, and is a nearly complete specimen.  The entire axehead is 135mm in length, with a maximum width across the flanges measuring 35.2mm.  

The blade has a mid-ridge in very low relief, and the blade expands very slightly out from the centre of the head, with the blade tips expanding out from the rest of the blade very dramatically.  The edge is cresent shaped.  In length, the blade is 67.02mm, and 113.24mm thick at its base and 1.04mm thick at the edge.

The flanges expand from the top and bottom of the septum in a sub-triangular fashion, peaking nearer to the blade than the butt.  In length, each flange measures 55.3mm and is 13.24mm wide from the septum to outer edge.

The septum is 8.5mm thick, 62.79mm long from the base of the blade to the butt, and 25.08mm in height/breadth.  The butt is slightly rounded with visible casting marks.

The object has an even green patina.",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-07-31T23:00:00Z,,,,296,,,14.24,135,1,Robert Collins,Robert Collins,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Scarborough,Wykeham,SE9579,From a paper map,54.197965,-0.545289,NCL-F9D767,,Collinson palstave axe.jpg,Bronze Age Palstave,Museum of Antiquities of the University and Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/Collinson palstave axe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/150492.jpg

195454,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"Casting  fragment from a potential bronze side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of Middle Bronze Age date (1500 - 1150 BC). The fragment is irregular in plan but is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a C shaped cross section forming a hollow socket and cast side loops. The fragment narrows along its length and its cross-section changes from a shallow C section at the base to an angular U shaped section at the opposite end. The fragment is likely to be waste from a miscast with only one part of the mould being filled with bronze. The casting fragment measures 37.5mm length, has a maximum width of 13.4mm and maximum thickness of 6.4mm. It weighs 4.97 grams. 

The blade (sides and tip), and base of the spearhead is lost and the fragment has been rolled in the ploughsoil making the edges irregular. All that survives of the spear is the central part of the socket, from the base of the blade to just below the two string-like loops. One of these loops is broken; the other is 9.8mm long, 2.7mm wide and project 2.8mm. The internal dimension is 4.5 x 2.2mm. The cross section of both the loops is sub-oval. The style of this type of loop is known as ‘string’ due to the small size and nature. These two loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead

The spearhead is a mid green colour with an even (but slightly flaky) patina. The patina has been abraded in several areas and there are several areas with an unstable surface. Some of these unstable surfaces have been caused by corrosion, which has caused the metal to laminate slightly. The inner socket of the spear is a mid green black colour and has a similar flaky patina. Similar coloured patinas can be seen on Late Bronze Age axes of the South Wales type specifically around the mouths and around the decorative ribs. It is unlikely that this affect has been caused by the burial environment as the outer surface would have a similar patina. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket. 

Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham’s Period 5 (c. 1500 – 1150 BC). A direct parallel has not been found for this casting fragment, although detailed searches of Middle Bronze Age hoards and Metalworking sites may provide a good comparison.",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,4.97,,,6.4,37.5,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Hereford,SO4839,,52.04694032,-2.75964803,HESH-BD11A4,,HESH-BD11A4.jpg,Middle Bronze Age: Casting Waste Spear ,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-BD11A4.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/199656.jpg
195572,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"A small (110mm long), unlooped palstave with a narrow blade which has only a slight splay towards the cutting edge (min. width of blade-face= 21mm, max.= 28mm). There is a single mid-rib on either face of length c.45mm which fades out c.30mm before the curved cutting edge. The blade-tips have rounded corners with no recurve. The septum is quite small (length=36mm, min. width=13mm, max.=22mm) with very slight flanges (max. height=2mm). The stop ridge is straight and one side is slightly higher than the other (width at stop-ridge=22mm). There are also traces of a casting-scar on one side. The colour of the palstave is a range of greens and browns, the surface is pitted with only a couple of small patches of the original surface surviving, one at the blade edge retains a patina and striations possibly indicative of sharpening or polishing.  It is an early palstave of the Acton Park or Taunton phase. Similar examples are one (of uncertain association) from the Acton Park Hoard itself (Lynch, Aldhouse-Green and Davies, 2000, pp104-5) and one from St Fagans, Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, pp169, no. 153).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-11-22T00:00:00Z,,,,152,,,19,110,1,Jeff Spencer,Jeff Spencer,Wales,Flintshire,Flintshire,Hope,SJ3059,From a paper map,53.123556,-3.047486,CPAT-D25B04,,2456-0002.jpg,Bronze Age Palstave,Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/jspencer/2456-0002.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/151987.jpg
