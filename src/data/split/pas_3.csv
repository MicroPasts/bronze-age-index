516668,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1500,"An incomplete copper alloy dagger, or dirk, of Bronze Age date. The dirk has been broken in half in antiquity. The dirk has four rivet holes. There is an even light green patina.


Dot. Boughton, FLO for Lancs and Cumbria and specialist in Bronze Age metalwork, has kindly offered the following research:


""According to Burgess and Gerloff (Ref: Burgess, C. and Gerloff, S. 1981. The dirks and and rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland. Praehistorische Bronzefunde IV, 7. Munich) (pg. 19):

""Group II: Dirks and rapiers assigned to Group II have blades showing a central ridge which produces a distinctive flattened lozenge cross-section. The edges can be plain or bevelled. The blades are generally plain, only a very few examples having lateral grooves or decorative bands across thr butt-end of the median ridge. Generally butts are more or less trapezoidal and have two rivets in rivet-holes, only a few having an additional pair of side notches, indicating a hilt affixes by four rivets in the Continental manner....... Blades of Group II differ considerably and it is only possible to distinguish three clear-cut Types within the group, the basis of classification being the shape and proportions of butt and blade. The remainder are all obviously related to each other but do not form any homogenous types or are too damaged for further classification.....""




They carry on describing their first type, ""Blades with four rivet holes"": (p. 20) A few weapons of Group II have four rivet holes, a feature not characteristic of British dirks and rapiers and more commonly found on the Continent where four-riveted trapezoidal butts are associated with Tumulus Culture rapiers in south Germany as well as Wohlde dirks in the North.""


Burgess and Gerloff show three examples (nos 66-68) which are deescribed as possible imports from Northern Germany. No. 68 is especially similar to the one recorded here.


There is therefore a high likelihood that this dagger or, more accurately, dirk, is actually a Continental piece, possibly from Northern Germany or southern Scandinavia.


There is a similar dirk on thios website: http://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Siedlung/Siedlungsgeschichte/Bronzezeit/ 


Another more or less appropriate comparison is a dagger which is part of the hoard from Berlin-Spandau. Its origin is possibly southern Scandinavia, Schleswig-Holstein or Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Northern Germany). It shares the four rivets, semi-circular shoulders/butt end and gently curved blade. There is an image (figure) here: Abb. 1,7 in: Schwenzer, S. 1997. ""Wanderer, kommst du nach Spa..."". In: Haensel, B. and Haensel, A. (eds.) 1997: Gaben an die Goetter. Schaetze der Bronzezeit Europas. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Preussischer Kulturbesitz und Freie Universitaet, Seminar fuer Ur- und Fruehgeschichte, p. 61-67.


Generally speaking I think that this is an artefact of the Continental tumulus culture which is part of the Middle Bronze Age and the date is c. 1600-1200BC, probably more towards the beginning of it, i.e. 1600-1500BC"".


The length of the dirk is 165mm. At its widest the dirk is 35mm. The blade is 19mm wide before tapering to a point and 4mm thick at the central axis.","

516750,Axehead,Bronze Age,,,,,"I am grateful for the following description which was produced by John Llywellyn Williams.



The axe was discovered in 2012 and is an interesting example of a Bandon type Developed axe displaying some atypical features. Bandon axes are distinguished by their small size, a rectangular, slightly tapering parallel sided body, convex sides developing into low hammered side flanges, a faintly defined proto stop ridge and a sharp lower body flare expanding into a deep crescentic blade with pointed blade tips. This specimen corresponds in most of the listed attributes but differs in the following manner. A very faint outline of a stop ridge can be discerned on one face but, most importantly, the side flanges were formed on this same single face. The obverse face is featureless and therefore defeats the object of creating an efficient hafting facility on the axe. In this capacity the specimen may be considered as an unfinished object which leads to the question why it was discarded rather than being recycled. Although not analysed the most likely composition of the axe is bronze. The object was discovered during metal detecting by an employee of the landowner and the context of burial is therefore not known.



In the Welsh corpus of Developed axes there are nine Bandon and Bandon affiliated examples from Wales with four representatives from northern Wales, respectively Crug (Bethel), Caerwys (Flintshire), Overton, (Wrexham) and Rhuallt (Denbigh). The Crug axe, the nearest geographically to Llanfaglan, is closely similar but has an extended body and is characterised by panelling on the face a feature unique to this axe. The closest parallels to the Llanfaglan axe are two axes from south Wales, namely the small, slightly damaged example from Llanfabon (Nelson - Caerphilly) and the example from Penllyn near Bridgend, one of a small group which appear to be associated with the location of a former lake.



The dimensions of the axe are - length 81.23mm; blade width 48.60mm; butt width 21.87mm; maximum body thickness 11.97mm, weight 151.6 gms.



Developed flat axes belong to metalworking assemblage IV, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 3 and can probably be dated to the interval between circa 2000 and 1750BC.

517406,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Bronze Age gold penannular ring. The object has a slightly tapering sub- circular section and is turned inwards to form an open loop. The object has flat terminals which are aligned almost parallel, tapering inwards slightly at their inner edge and are set 4mm apart.


Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of the penannular ring carried out by the British Museum's Department of Conservation and Scientific Research indicated a gold content of 82-85%, silver content of 12-14%, the remainder being copper. The ring weighs 6.06 grams and the specific gravity measurement of 17.49 indicates that it is gold alloy throughout, not plated.

518968,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-700,"A complete cast copper alloy (bronze) socketed axe of Late Bronze Age dating (950 to 700 BC).


The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge and the socket is sub-rectangular in cross section. The socket of the axe is sub-rectangular, with an irregular mouth. The top edge of the socket shows little evidence of casting jets that have been trimmed flush with the socket mouth. One of the four casting runners survives the extensive abrasion and can be clearly identified. The mould has slipped slightly during the casting process. The swollen moulded collar of the socket is relatively wide and varies in thickness along its length. At the base of the collar a small swollen rib extends. The loop is well preserved and relatively small and wide with a irregular lentoid shaped cross section. It is set in a low position on the axe being set beneath the collar in line with the horizontal moulding.The horizontal cast moulding is present on both faces and the edges of the axe; however this is better preserved on one face. From this moulding, on each face, three parallel longitudinal ribs descend. The ribs are complete and taper along their length terminating approximately in the middle of the axe. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade.The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion.


The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion. Here a dark green coloured metal can be seen. Some of this exposed metal has a light green powdery copper corrosion present. The areas worst affected are those around the collar, socket and cutting edge. These areas of exposed metal should be monitored for signs of active corrosion (bright greeny powdery residue). To reduce the risk of this occurring, the axe head should be stored in an dry acid-free environment, such as a sealed tupperware box, with silica gel and acid free tissue paper.


The axe measures 101.15mm in length, 45.20mm wide, is 38.55mm thick and weighs 185.7 grams. The depth of the socket is 75.94mm.


This axe fits into a well known distribution of ribbed axes present in the Northern Marches (Shropshire) and north and East Wales. It can be paralleled with a similar socketed ribbed axe from Breiddon Hillfort (Powys) which was discovered during excavations. This also had a portion of preserved willow haft which was radiocarbon dated to the period 754 ± 50 CAL BC(Musson 1991). This fits with the final phases of the Late Bronze Age specifically that associated with Ewart Park industrial phase. Similar discoveries of Socketed Axes (from which this example may be paralleled) can be seen in the Willow Moor Hoards (of 1790's and 1840's) from Little Wenlock, Shropshire (Chitty 1928). A similar axe was also discovered in a hoard of axes from Pencoyd, Herefordshire (2005-T412). This was also dated to the Ewart Park phase. These axes correspond in date with Needham's period 7 (Needham:1996) Very few Socketed axes have been discovered or reported from Shropshire in recent years so this example is particularly important to the understanding of Late Bronze Age Archaeology of the County.","
Thanks are extended to both Dot Broughton (Cumbrian FLO) and Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) for their help with the identification and recording of this find.

Max. length 15.93mm; max. width 8.14mm; max. thickness 4.4mm; thickness of wire approx.. 0.62mm; weight 2.26 grams.



Both manufacturing technique and composition are consistent with a Bronze Age date, although precise analogues for the type are presently lacking. Gold ribbon ornaments are known from the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1300-1100 BC, but the ribbed effect is achieved here by grooving (cf the piece from Ilam, Staffs. (Treasure Annual Report 2005/6, 20, no.14). Solder is used at this date in the manufacture of other gold ornament types such as (probably) the pendant from Burton, where circular-sectioned wire has been spiralled to form the biconical element (Treasure Annual Report 2004, 198, no.485). In the same hoard was an unusual bracelet; the wires were here twisted and fixed at each end by flat rectangular terminals but also at intervals by solder. Solder was also frequently used in the making of Middle Bronze Age composite rings. Later during the Bronze Age the face-plates of lock rings were sometimes made from individual wires soldered together, a technique which may have originated in Ireland.



As the object is prehistoric and contains precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Designation Order 2002.



Gillian Varndell



Curator, Department of Prehistory and Europe.","Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a folded gold strip from Chislet, Kent, indicated a gold content of approximately 87-90%, a silver content of approximately 9-11% with approximately 1% copper. The strip is formed from gold wires joined side by side by soldering, a technique used in the Bronze Age to produce this reeded effect. The object weighs 2.26 grams.

""This is a fragment from either an Atlantic bucket, Danubian style series, Type Nannau-Dowris or a Hiberno-British bucket like the ones from Dowalton and Duddingston Loch, both in the National Museum in Edinburgh. These are nos 166 and 167 in Gerloff's catalogue respectively and the date is c. late Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork tradition, that is c. 1100-800BC. Gerloff does date the buckets into the Llyn Fawr period, but I am not sure what her evidence is - I certainly haven't seen any bucket fragments from EIA hoards or contexts and I have seen them if not all, then most of them I would say.""



""The loop on this example is not complete, i.e. 360 degrees. It is usually around 180-190 degrees and ridged like this example. The ridging derives from separately cast rings that were soldered together somehow - the later ones, like this example, only have ridges left. The ends of the 180/190 degree circle are attached to a staple/clamp which in turn clamps around the vessel opening/rim. The rim is usually rolled up or folded or strengthened with a rod (like in the example above) because usually, the handles were too fragile to lift a bronze bucket or cauldron, especially when it was filled/full. The sheet metal would rip and I think this is probably what happened in this example from Dowalton. There are other handles with handle attachments from hoards and buckets/cauldrons are incredibly rare.""","Gerloff, S. 2010. 'Atlantic cauldrons and buckets.

522840,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"An incomplete late Middle to early Late Bronze Age (1400 - 1100 BC) copper alloy notched-butt type rapier, missing its tip and with a worn butt end. The break is old and the blade is bent a little (horizontally) just before the break. Measures 95.84mm in length and weighs 31.53g.


The butt end has recent damage to the top edge, with loss of patina, and two notches just above the shoulders (the widest point, which measures 29.27x3.38mm).


The narrowing blade extends from the shoulders with a broad flat mid-rib. It is thickest (4.63mm) just below the shoulders. The blade measures 8.44x3.22mm at the break, which is rather more pointed-oval in cross-section.


Dot Boughton comments:  I would tentatively suggest this belongs to Gerloff and Burgess Group IV dating from the late Middle Bronze Age to the early Late Bronze Age, that is somewhere between the Taunton and Penard metalwork assemblages. The rapiers from the Appleby hoard (in Cumbria) look similar and there is an entire Type Appleby in Group IV dating between c. 1200-1100 BC (early Penard metalwork assemblage).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-07-28T23:00:00Z,,,,31.53,,,4.63,95.84,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South West,Swindon,Swindon,Liddington,SU2278,Centred on field,51.500513,-1.684453,WILT-AD8D05,,WILT-AD8D05.jpg,Middle-Late Bronze Age rapier,Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/WILT-AD8D05.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/398769.jpg
522921,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Description



Half of a penannular ring of circular cross-section comprising gold foil covering a base metal (copper alloy) core. The exposed core and outer surface of the gold are iron-stained, probably from the burial environment. The fragment appears to have been quite neatly cut from the direction of the gap as the inner edge of the cross-section is flattened over the edge of the core and the outer edge is more ragged.



Maximum diameter 18mm; width 7.0 x 6.5mm. Weight 5.67 grams.



Composition



Appended report below.



Identification



A well known later Bronze Age type, decorative in character, c.1150-750 BC.","As the piece is ancient and contains a minimum of 10% gold, it qualifies as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.

--



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a fragment of a penannular ring from Steyning, West Sussex, indicated a gold content of approximately 77-80%, a silver content of 16-18%, the remainder being copper. The analysis of one broken end detected mostly iron but with copper and tin. Iron is detected on this core and on the outer surface of the gold which would support the view that it is the result of contamination from the burial environment and that the core metal was copper alloy. The ring weighs 5.67 grams.

530709,Lunula,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2400,-2000,"The lunula is in two parts and nearly complete, only missing one of the circular terminals. The object is made of gold and so the precious metal content is more than 10%.



The lunula is semi-circular in plan although both parts have been folded. There is one part which does not have a terminal and it is this section which is less folded making the semi-circular shape more obvious. The widest section of the lunula is where the two pieces have broken apart and then the object tapers towards the terminals. The section which still has a circular terminal is more severely folded and there is a break in the object from the inner edge. The two sides are folded underneath themselves and there is also a folding which creates an acute angle. The lunula then flattens before turning so that the back of the terminal faces forward.



There is a border of five lines which run along the inner and outer edges of the object. From the inner most line there are a series of inwardly radiating lines which create small triangles on the border. As the object tapers towards the terminals there is more detailing which runs across the width of the object. The geometric design is maintained is lateral linear incisions interspersed with near perpendicular lines which create small triangles.



Finds of Bronze Age lunulae are very rare from Britain although they are a slightly more common find in Ireland. Examples from Britain are known from the West of the country, there are three in the National Museum of Scotland (X.FE.1, X.FE.3 and X.FE.4) which are from Western Scotland and one (X.FE.2) which was found in Northern Scotland. These lunulae are similar to this example in their decoration although the lunula from Morayshire (X.FE.2) has more rectangular terminals. There are also several Irish examples in the British Museum such as the Blessington lunula (WG.31) which again show the rounded terminals and the geometric incised decoration.



There is a lunula terminal recorded on the PAS database which is now in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle (LANCUM-449151). This example has a more rectangular terminal similar to the example in the National Museum of Scotland and again fits the more western distribution of objects of this type. The findspot of the lunula from East Yorkshire is extremely unusual.



Taylor (1970) has created three classes of lunula and this example is likely to be the provincial type similar to one from Wales in the British Museum (1869,0619.1). The provincial type of lunula is made of slightly thicker foil and is narrower than the classical type of which the Blessington lunula is an example.

Description



The greater part of a lunula in two pieces. The more complete (a) has a small, oval terminal which is missing from the other piece (b). The two portions are very crumpled and folded and it is difficult to tell whether any of the central part is missing.



(a): the oval terminal has a slender stem; this is the more damaged portion of the lunula being both crumpled and folded; it is also twisted at the horn tip. Weight: 40.39g.



(b): is less distorted and has a maximum surviving width of c 58mm. The thickness at the edge is c 0.2mm and averages at c 0.55mm centrally. Weight: 36.29g.



The total weight is 76.68g.



The horns are decorated, each bearing a panel of alternate plain and decorated zones of engraved geometric motifs. The edges of the whole are each outlined by five unevenly spaced engraved lines with a row of dentate decoration forming the inmost motif. The five lines reduce to three at the horn and to one at the horn tip.



The decoration of the horns is orientated across the width and comprises single rows of dentate motif (^) alternating with multiple engraved lines (-) and plain zones (P) following this regime: ^-^-^P^-^-^P^-



Identification



Lunulae are flat gold crescentic ornaments with spatulate terminals. According to Needham (2000) they may largely overlap primary Bell Beaker goldwork, c 2400-2000BC.



In Taylor's classification of lunulae (Classical, Unaccomplished and Provincial; Taylor 1970), the Thwing example falls within the Provincial group in terms of width, thickness and decoration. Classical lunulae are found chiefly in Ireland with three from Cornwall and two attributed to Scotland (Eogan 1994); Unaccomplished lunulae are exclusively Irish finds, while Provincial lunulae have been found in the highland zones of Britain and the western area of the European continent. An occurrence in East Yorkshire is thus outside the expected distribution.



As the items are gold and datable to the Early Bronze Age they qualify as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.

530761,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1250,-800,"A fragment from a cast blade, of Middle Bronze Age dating (c. 1250 BC to c. 800 BC).


The blade fragment is sub trapezoidal in plan, and sub rectangular in section. The remains of a circular rivet hole is present at the top of the fragment. The remnants of the original plan surface (concave, narrowing towards the edge) is located along the left hand side of the fragment.


The fragment measures 33.70 mm in length, 34.04 mm wide and 3.10 mm thick. It weighs 12.6 grams.


The fragment is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina.


The shape of the fragment, including the original bladed edge is suggestive that this fragment may have originally been part of a dagger or a rapier. However due to the size of the fragment, this identification is only a possibility.


Comment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): One edge has been broken to form a trapezoidal shape  as these things normally have two rivet holes both on the upper edge in the corners. I think from the pictures one is good for the original edge - the other is happenstance and where the second hole should be is lost - or deliberately cut down for an unknown reason - it looks deliberately thinned in section - it may have been cut down to form another object - possibly a razor.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-09-08T23:00:00Z,,,,12.6,,,3.1,33.7,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Myddle and Broughton,SJ4423,Generated from computer mapping software,52.801635,-2.832069,WMID-A3EDA5,,WMID-A3EDA5.jpg,WMID-A3EDA5: Middle Bronze Age: Dagger / Rapier blade fragment,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-A3EDA5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/404756.jpg
530777,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"An incomplete cast copper alloy, probable flat axe, of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2250 BC to c. 1900 BC).


The fragment is sub rectangular in plan and section. One end tapers to a point and is sub circular in shape. The edges of the fragment gradually taper outwards and the fragment develops a square cross section. An old break is present across the top of the fragment.


The fragment measures 50.84 mm in length, 25.09 mm wide and has a maximum thickness of 8.38 mm. It weighs 41.0 grams.


The fragment is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface and detail. The patina has flaked away in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green area. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (a bright green powdery residue) occurring. To reduce the risk of this happening, the fragment should be stored in a sealed dry, air tight environment, such as a tupperware box lined with acid free tissue paper and silica gel.


This fragment is probably the butt of a late flat axe something like a type Migdale or Type Alyesford which may or may not have a proto stop ridge or slight raised side flanges, although it may have possibly been developed into a long flanged axehead. These are of Early Bronze Age dating .


Comment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): Although incomplete this axe best fits into the final phases of the Migdale metalworking tradition Type: Migdale - decorated variant. However, it does share some of the characteristics (mostly of blade shape) of the Developed Flat Axes specifically variants Falkland and Scrabo Hill. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL.

The blade expands into a crescent shaped cutting edge, one tip of which has broken off and is missing.  The cutting edge has a blade facet, and rows of hammer marks are visible on the rest of the blade. The point between the butt and the blade (the stop) is the thickest point of the axe, but the change of angle here is very slight and there is no obvious stop ridge; the flanges extend slightly beyond this point. There is a slight ridge or nick across each side face at the end of the flanges. visible in plan view. The butt tapers from 14.85mm thick at the stop , to 3.3mm at the butt. The internal measurement between the flanges is about 17 at the base and 19mm at the top of the flanges. The flange sides are slightly convex, but the blade sides are straight. The axe has a smooth, dark green patina with a few scratches and gouges. It is 124.2mm long, 56.5mm wide and 28.6mm thick. It weighs 396gm.

A late Bronze Age axe of plain Southeastern type. The loop and collar are missing and the casting seams are filed smooth. The socket extends below a constriction into a void which fills the interior of the blade. This has resulted in distortion of the blade, which has split across its width, leaving one side of the blade bending outwards. The void within the blade appears to be a casting accident when, perhaps, part of the central core dislodged during casting. A similar feature was noted on a socketed axe found in a hoard of axes at Woodcote, south London.

The three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham, hoard are similar in form, size and weight to the Salthouse bead (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts (including bronze palstaves) that allow it to be dated to c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid.).

Middle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. forthcoming) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).

Along the upper surface of this artefact are the remains of a single casting jet or runner, which runs the length of the object and is rectangular in plan; it is also heavily abraded which has resulted in the loss of the complete form of the jet. The underside of this fragment is slightly convex and heavily worn, with the sides of this artefact rounded through abrasion. It has a light-mid green colour overall.

544511,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.94 mm (thickness: 2.25 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there may be evidence of a proto stop ridge (median bevel) as the butt does exhibit flattening of both surfaces. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (10.11 mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 27.87 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.



It measures 65.79 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 27.87 mm, width at the butt is 12.94 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 10.11 mm. It weighs 56.5 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

544699,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,POST MEDIEVAL,-2150,1500,"A complete cast copper alloy probable Awl, possibly of Bronze Age dating but could easily be later in dating (2150 BC to c. AD 1500).


The awl consists of a sub square sectioned artefact that gradually tapers from a wide centre, to a sharp point at both ends. No obvious tang is present. Faint grooves are present down each of the thicker sides.


It measures 51.35 mm in length, has a maximum width of 3.49 mm and has a maximum thickness of 3.24 mm. It weighs 2.4 g.


The probable awl is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.


Similar artefacts have been recorded on the PAS database as NMS-ACEA64, NMS-0F5EF3, SF-6FC795, LVPL-7E3686, GLO-9FB903, HESH-399E94 and PUBLIC-5155C5. However as awls are a functional artefact, the form changes very little from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval period. Similar awls were found during the excavations at York (Ottaway & Rogers, 2002, pages 2729-2730, fig 1338), in particular SF 11522, which exhibits a similar groove on one side like this example and has been dated to the late 11th Century AD. Therefore this example could be of any date from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval Period (2150 BC to 1500 AD).

Only the tip of the the spearhead survives; it has a rounded mid rib with narrow wings. The tip is slightly bent, probably through use, and the wings are chipped, perhaps due to thinning of the metal from corrosion which may have led to some losses from the outer edge of each wing.

Richard Davis comments that he has not seen a fragment like this before. He notes:





1. It is not clear what type of spearhead this is - whether it had loops or pegholes in the socket, and whether it is from the Middle or Late Bronze Age.


2. Cuts in the blade edges are normally the result of combat damage or an intentional ""killing"" of the spearhead prior to votive deposition. Excellent examples of this ""killing"" is found in some of the spearheads from the Blackmoor Hoard, also from Hampshire. However, intentional cuts in blade edges are normally found in spearheads that are deposited when complete or with a large part remaining, not just as a fragment as in this case.


3. The multiple cuts on one blade edge look decorative - the upper four cuts are at regular intervals. The reworking may have been to form a tool, but this seems unlikely as the jagged edges are not sharp. The apparent barb on the other blade edge does not seem to have a particular function.


In summary,the probability is that it is a fragment of an LBA pegged spearhead, because the incidence of intentional fragments was far greater in this period. This is an interesting and unique piece, but one whose condition and damage is difficult to interpret.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,16.97,,,8.75,49.6,1,Richard Davis,Margaret Broomfield,South East,Hampshire,Winchester,Chilcomb,SU5028,GPS (from the finder),51.04918,-1.288079,SUR-0FB443,,12-1344a.JPG,Bronze age: Spear,Surrey County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/margaretb/12-1344a.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/421783.jpg

550383,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1300,"A cast copper alloy (bronze) early palstave / primary Group I - shield patterned palstave of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1300 BC) - most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.



The palstave is broadly rectangular in plan with relatively straight parallel side which flare on the lower blade and expand to form a wide crescentic cutting edge / blade. In profile the palstave is lentoid with the widest section being before and after the stop ridge - where it tapers to form the butt and blade. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 100.4mm long and the width of cutting edge is 69.0mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 2.4mm and the cutting edge is well preserved and still sharp. The maximum thickness of the blade is 17.2mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 32.7mm). The upper blade is well preserved. A poorly defined sub-triangular shaped dish is present on both faces - although it is more defined on one edge. This depression is interpreted as a form of shield pattern, although the exterior edges are not decorated / defined with raised ribs. This form of palstave is not commonly looped. However on the edges of the upper blade - slightly below the stop ridge Two raised transverse ribs / swellings are present. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and irregular in profile; the sides in profile are parallel. In section the butt has an H shaped cross section - although the raised side flanges. The rear section of the palstave measures 76.4mm length and has a maximum thickness 38.0mm. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 73.4mm long, and 17.8mm wide and 6.7mm thick. The butt of the axe is complete - it has a slight U shaped notch at the centre of the butt but this is patinated suggesting damage in antiquity. The width at the butt is 27.4mm. The flange facets are broadly sub-triangular (an irregular arc) in shape they are at their highest point prior to the junction with the stop ridge and project onto the upper blade. The stop ridge is set very low and is fused to flanges  - this forms two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. The side flange extends to a maximum height of 15.3mm above the septum and the stop ridge is 6.0mm high. The profile of the flanges on one face is slightly irregular with V shaped notches being removed - this is original to the manufacture an dis possibly a casting flaw - all the edges of these notches are patinated. The junction between the septum and stop ridge is crescentic in shape and the base of the septum is slightly hollow - has a U shaped depression. The long edges of the axe have been finished and the remnants of the casting seam have been removed by trimming, filing and hammering. The palstave measures 176.8mm long and weighs 569 grams. The relative heaviness of the axe could suggest a larger than normal degree of lead being added to the alloy.



The palstave is a mid brown colour with a thick well formed patina which covers almost all surfaces of the axe. In a number of places the patina has been removed by active corrosion - where this has occurred a roughened light green coloured metal is present. The patina has been removed on one flange and a bright metallic brass colour has been revealed - this damage is likely to be due to the axe being clipped during its removal from the soil. The axe is remarkably unabraded and the tips of the axe blade are unusually well preserved - this suggests that the axe has never been within upper / active ploughzone.



Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in: Savory, 1980; Catalogue of the Bronze Age collections in the National Museum of Wales; Figs 19-20 cat no 132 Llanfair-mathafarn-eithaf, Anglesey / Yns Mon and 139-142 Chepstow, Glos, Llanddaniel-fab (Anglesey) and Caernarvonshire respectively.

The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan and in section.

The axehead is rounded at one end, the cutting edge, and the axe then tapers towards the butt. The axe is quite thin and does not vary much in thickness although the middle is slightly thicker than the outer edges. There is no evidence for decoration on the surface of the object but that could be due to the fact that the surface has corroded away completely. The object is purpley-brown in colour with areas of a light green corrosion.


It is likely that this dates to the Early Bronze Age and metalworking stage I to II which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2, circa 2500 to 2050 CAL. BC.

Discussion



The tanged chisel (1) has other parallels in the database such as a tanged chisel from South Oxfordshire (Byard 2012) (BERK-52E8C3) and one other from Winfrith Newburgh, Dorset (Hayward Trevarthen 2012) (DOR-F18347). Tanged chisels have been found in several Bronze Age hoards and have a wide distribution in Britain and Ireland.



Burgess and Gerloff (1981, 36ff) include a blade of similar shape and size to the tanged dagger or knife from Bolton-Le-Sands (2) in their Group II ('Damaged Blades Modified for Rehafting'). It is similar to an example from Marston Trussel, Northamptonshire (Ibid, no.248), described as: ""[A t]anged blade, either a knife made in this form or possibly a dirk with butt cut down for rehafting, in which case the torn rivet hole would have been secondary."" (Ibid., pl. 32, no 248). It is also similar to two others on the Portable Antiquity Scheme database. One a cast tanged knife found in Dorset (DOR-FAC625) and the other an incomplete knife found in Wiltshire (WILT-83A428).



Both finds (1-2) can be dated on typological ground to the Late Bronze Age Wilburton and Ewart Park phases, c.1000-850 BC. Metalworking waste (3-4) is a common feature of Late Bronze Age hoards and finds.



The four objects (1-4) appear to have been associated and represent a single find.



Conclusion



In terms of their age and grouping of more than two items, this find qualifies as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage and so as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure (Designation) Order 2002.

The end of the butt is rounded, presumably by wear. The surface where this object was detached from the rest of the axe is rough and shows the pale green signs of recent corrosion. This probably represents a recent break. Suggested date: Middle Bronze Age, 1300-1150 BC.

One end of the object terminates in a sharp point and has a circular cross section. The object widens at its centre and becomes increasingly sub-rectangular in section. The object has been flattened towards the tang end and becomes sub-rectangular in section. This end of the object is flat, however it is slightly rough which suggests it has been broken and the object is incomplete. The object appears to have been cleaned so has lost much of its patina.

A date of Bronze Age has been given for this object due to similar examples on the database. However the record for a similar object - WMID-BA89E6 - states that, as awls are functional artefacts, their form changes very little from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval period. Similar awls were found during the excavations at York (Ottaway & Rogers, 2002, pages 2729-2730, fig 1338). Therefore such example could be of any date from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval Period (2150 BC to AD 1500).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2011-11-22T00:00:00Z,2012-11-21T00:00:00Z,,,4.6,,,5.1,56.1,1,Lucy Creighton,Lucy Creighton,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Selby,Towton,SE4839,From finder,53.845032,-1.271935,SWYOR-320717,,PAS_2057_awl1.jpg,Bronze Age Awl,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/lucyc/PAS_2057_awl1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/421444.jpg

These ingot fragments probably belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, dating to c.1000-800 BC. Four of the fragments are plano-convex, being rounded on one side and flat on the other. Ingots such as these were cast in a dish-shaped mould, and are often referred to as 'bun' ingots due to their shape. Ingots of raw metal were transported and traded throughout Britain and Europe during the Late Bronze Age. They were frequently broken up into fragments, ready to be smelted to make a range of bronze weaponry, tools and ornaments. Ingots (and ingot fragments) are a regular feature of LBA hoard deposits in southern England (cf. Turner 2010, 86-7). Numerous plano-convex ingot fragments have been recovered in Devon and the surrounding regions (e.g. Powell 2005a; 2005b), most notably the copper and tin ingots recovered from a probable shipwreck site off the coast of Salcombe (Roberts & Veysey 2011; Needham et al. forthcoming). Scientific analysis is currently being undertaken on the Salcombe finds at the British Museum (B. Roberts pers comm.). The East Devon finds are therefore significant for their potential (subject to future analysis) to reveal information regarding patterns of trade and exchange in the Late Bronze Age period in the South-West of Britain.","As these seven Late Bronze Age ingots were found in the same field within c. 20m of each other, they are most likely to originate from a single deposit, which has been dispersed. This material is eligible as Treasure under the Treasure Order (2002), as it is a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects.",3,Copper alloy,,Donated to museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-03-04T00:00:00Z,,2013T196,,,,,,,7,Danielle Wootton,Danielle Wootton,South West,Devon,East Devon,Otterton,SY0884,Centred on field,50.64839446,-3.30264451,DEV-ED41D1,,2013T196.jpg,Bronze Age Hoard,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/beckyd/2013T196.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/478557.jpg

The axe is complete and is of diminutive size (with an overall length of 79.9mm and a weight of 56.8g). The butt (with a width of 13mm) is straight but angled. Both sides are convex, reaching its maximum width (of 17.1mm) immediately behind the proto stop ridge, before expanding sharply to produce an expanded blade edge. The side facets have been hammered and are also convex across their depths, with a maximum depth at the stop (of 10.9mm and a maximum height of 1.5mm). The angled side facets are decorated linear diagonals, in opposing directions on the opposite facets. There is no evidence for decoration at the central band of the sides. The flanges appear to end immediately before the butt. The septum is straight and gradually thickens to the stop (where the axe has a thickness of 8.9mm and a consistent septum width of 8mm). In front of the stop, the blade is decorated with four incised lines, before an intricate incised motif on the blade, comprising two columns (on each blade) of inverted V's, not quite meeting at the centre. The flanges on the blade give the appearance of converging at their terminals, defining a rounded end. Beneath is the blade facet, which is not decorated and gradually narrows to the blade edge. The blade (with a width 25.6mm) is slightly recurved. The surface has a dark-brown patina with some pitting and surface loss.","The axe has a number of unusual features and does not easily fit into the Developed axe sequence as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981) .

555618,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1250,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) dagger fragment of Middle Bronze Age dating (1400 BC to 1250 BC).


Less than 25% of the dagger is present. The rest is presumed, lost in antiquity. The dagger fragment is sub rectangular in plan. The dagger has a sub lentoid cross section. The remains of one rivet hole is present at the top, the other is missing. The blade tapers towards the edges. None of the edges are original, all have been damaged. Neither side of the blade exhibits decoration.


The blade measures 64.32 mm in length, 35.70 mm wide and 2.95 mm thick. It weighs 28.9 g.


The blade is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface patina, leaving areas of a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion from occurring. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box, such as a tupperware box, with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue paper and silica gel.","Comment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): I think this is the hilt and upper blade of a trapizodal hilted rapier of middle BA date. The remains of one rivet hole can be seen on the upper edge of the hilt - and the upper part is  a clear trapezoid tapering in width and expanding in section at the junction with the upper blade - which seems slightly stepped - although abrasion hasn't been kind - the blade looks lentoid in section and the upper plate has a flatter section.


From the profile I think it looks most like a Grp III rapier or more likely  a dirk (shorter rapier - under 30cm / 1ft in length)- see http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/109896 and http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/rapiers-and-dirks

Less than 25% of the socketed axehead is present, consisting of the base of the socket and the blade edge. The fragment is sub rectangular in plan, and triangular in section. The socket is rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along both of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at the sides. Possible filemarks are present on the front and back of the axehead.


The socketed axehead fragment measures 33.83 mm in length, 52.77 mm wide (at the blade), 41.23 mm wide (at the body), 19.62 mm thick (at the body), 3.46 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 15.13 mm deep. It weighs 67.3 g.


The socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.


Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) comments that it is late BA rather than Middle - as in post Wilburton - Llyn Fawr phase (1150-750 BC).  Almost all socketed axes are from the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC). It looks as if it comes from a narrow bladed axe - something like a Yorkshire or Meldrith type - but there is just not enough to say one way or the other (definitely not a Swales Axe).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-11-01T00:00:00Z,2006-11-30T00:00:00Z,,,67.3,,,19.62,33.83,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Hyde Lea,SJ9120,From finder,52.77750833,-2.13485881,WMID-EB5248,,WMID-EB5248.jpg,Middle to Late Bronze Age: Socketed Axehead fragment,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-EB5248.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/423792.jpg

557432,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy looped palstave with central rib and raised flange facets dating from the Middle Bronze Age (1500 BC - 1150 BC).


The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and an incomplete convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 88.35 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 40.27 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 2.93 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 16.68 mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 24.46 mm).


Beneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a tapering central rib. This rib extends approximately half way down the length of the blade. The rib itself, although present on both sides, is crisper and less eroded on one of the two faces.


The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 62.63 mm long, 17.55 mm wide, and 8.13 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving one corner rounded. The butt is 19.25 mm wide and 3.09 mm thick. The loop is 26.42 mm long, by 8.83 mm wide and projects 9 mm.


The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. On one side the flange facets are convex and curve over to almost form an open socket. Whereas the other side has less pronounced or developed facets.


In total the palstave measures 149.45 mm in length, 40.33 mm wide (maximum) and 25.72 mm thick. It weighs 262.3 g.


Several casting flaws in the form of air bubbles are present on the septum. The poor quality of the casting is confirmed by an xray of the palstave which demostrated several large air bubbles within the internal structure of the palstave.


The palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.


Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in Savory, 1980; catalogue entries 171, 172, 175, and 263 (the Mynydd Ta-y-glannau, Cemmaes Hoard). All of these examples fit into the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II).

558553,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy blade, of Middle Bronze Age dating (1500 CAL BC to 1150 CAL BC - Needham's Period 5).


The blade fragment is sub trapezoidal in plan, and lentoid in cross section. The blade tapers towards either edge. The edges to the top and bottom are old, pre depostional breaks. No evidence of rivet holes are present at the top of the blade fragment. No decoration is present on either the front or back of the blade.


It measures 62.34 mm in length, has a maximum width of 22.69 mm and a minimum of 14.43 mm. It is 2.82 mm thick in the centre of the blade and 1.06 mm thick along the blade edges. It weighs 11.6 g.


The blade fragment is a mid to dark brown colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has been removed in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze diseases) occurring. This would be a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue and silica gel.","Comment from Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO): As for the blade fragment - from the  size I think you are looking at either a large dagger or probably more likely a rapier fragment. The hilt would have been trapezoidal - and it has lost its rivets and upper part - it has also lost the shoulders but you can then see the blade thickening away from the hilt to for the mid rib. I expect the other end continued for maybe 1/3 again as the rib is parallel even if the sides aren't due to plough roll. 


Similar rapiers have been dated to the later Middle Bronze Age (MBA III - specifically the Penard phase / industry) - Rowlands 1976 p68-70) which corresponds with Needham's Period 5 (1500-1150 CAL BC).",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-02-03T00:00:00Z,,,,11.6,,,2.82,62.34,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,East Staffordshire,Uttoxeter,SK0734,From finder,52.903393,-1.897374,WMID-277BF6,,WMID-277BF6.jpg,Middle Bronze Age: Dagger / Blade fragment,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-277BF6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/425465.jpg
558981,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"The find consists of a fragment of a socketed instrument, a socketed tool, five fragments of a hollow ring with semi-circular cross section and a length of copper alloy wire.



The find can be considered as an addendum to 2010 T442 based on the location of the find and the typological similarities between artefacts from both cases/finds. Furthermore, the fragment of socketed tool and hollow ring may belong to (and refit with) objects from 2010 T442. This impression was gained from examining the available photos of the earlier case (since acquired by the Society of Antiquaries, Newcastle, after being declared Treasure). The objects in this new find are very similar in form and condition. They appear, therefore, to derive from a dispersed hoard.

Copper alloy socketed punch or awl. Small area of damage to mouth of socket, otherwise in good state of preservation. Two perforations at opposite sides of the socket mouth. The socket has two ribs and extends to a stem with four sides that comes to a broken point with a 'blob' of corrosion metal. The object appears to have been a socketed punch or awl.




Length: 70mm; Diameter of socket: 17.5mm; Weight: 26.4g





The copper alloy socketed instruments (Nos. 2, 4) are typical of the Late Bronze Age, as are the fragments of the copper alloy fitting (No. 3), and is a type found in other hoards of this period (e.g. The Great Freeman Street Hoard, Nottinghamshire: Smith 1957, GB. 22, 2(2), No. 16; The Grosvenor Crescent hoard: Colquhoun & Burgess 1988, pl. 174, 9; Wilburton hoard: Ibid., pl. 152, 5; Fincham, West Norfolk: NHER Number: 36176; and the Monmore hoard, Killin, Stirling: Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 185, no. 1045). A similar ring was recently reported as a single find through the Portable Antiquities Scheme (NMS-688046) from Burnham Market and Burnham Overy, Norfolk.



The similarities it shares with an object discovered in the 2010 T442 (No. 8) find suggest that it may belong to the same type of object, possibly the same object. If the fragments of No. 3 do indeed match this earlier object, then the identification of this as probable phalara in the report for 2010 T442 can now be called into question and revised (cf. O'Connor 1975).



The socketed awl or punch (No. 4) is relatively difficult to parallel, although the socketed technology and associations are well known Late Bronze Age features. A similar tool is recorded as a single find from Lea Marshes, Walthamstow (British Museum: WG 1762). Another example is from a Late Bronze Age hoard found near the Pigeon's Cave, on the North side of Great Orme's Head, Caernarvonshire, Wales (Savory 1980, no. 307, 4). Savory raises the possibility that it may have functioned as an awl for metalworking or a spiked ferrule for mounting on the end of a spear (Ibid., 127). The former seems more likely.","On the balance of probabilities, based on typological comparanda and spatial proximity, the objects that comprise this find are part of a dispersed Late Bronze Age hoard that also included finds from an earlier case (2010 T442), and are therefore treated as an addendum to that case.

559829,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1150,410,"
A complete cast copper alloy awl, possibly dating to the later Bronze Age but more possibly as late as the early Roman period. The awl has a sub-rectangular cross section at one end that may have originally terminated in a flattened wedge-shape, as other examples recorded on this database do. This terminal widens to become more rounded in the centre of the awl with the opposing end tapering to a point. There is some pitting on the surface of the awl which suggests some age, however there is some debate as to the date of such awls, which probably first appeared in the Late Bronze Age but could conceivably have continued to have been made until much later; here the patina does suggests a later prehistoric date.

560603,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1600,"The axehead is made from cast copper alloy. The axe is complete, but one corner has been recently broken, but is not missing. In plan the axe is a sub elongated triangle. The butt is rounded, and in profile slightly tapers to a rounded edge. The sides are straight with no flaring outwards of the blade tip. The blade cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical suggesting the axe was functional rather than votive. In profile, lengthways, the axehead curves slightly. The surface of the axehead has an abraded surface with patches of blue corrosion and a large area of encrustation. The patina is a mottled mid grey/green colour.

The nature of the corrosion, with blue patches and analysis of past flat axes suggest the material is more likely to be copper rather than copper alloy or has a particularly high copper content.

1. Copper alloy Sussex Loop bracelet or armlet. In one piece but broken in two places. Lozengical cross-section. The loop was made from a single, twisted bar with flattened terminals. The metal is heavily corroded on most surfaces and broken in two places. Where the edges of the bar are better preserved, it is possible to identify rows of decorative 'nicks' applied to the corners of the lozenge shaped metal rod.

2. Copper alloy Sussex Loop bracelet or armlet. Fragmentary. Lozengical cross-section. The loop was made from a single, twisted bar with flattened terminals. The loop is broken into six fragments (No. i-vi, below), and, unlike loop No. 1, is no longer held together as one piece. The metal is heavily corroded across most surfaces but is better preserved along short lengths of the bar than loop No. 1. Where the original edges of the bar are preserved, it is possible to identify rows of decorative 'nicks' applied to the corners of the lozenge shaped metal rod (i.e. on two of four edges).

6. Copper alloy palstave ['1'] (Rowlands's Class 3). No trace of ribs to blade or butt end, blade edge missing its corner.



Dimensions: Weight: 333g; Length: 153mm; Blade width (surviving): 56mm



7. Copper alloy palstave ['3'] (Rowlands's Class 2, Group 2, side flanged). In two fragments. Prominent medial rib running from the stop ridge to the centre of the blade edge, it is not possible to detect whether a medial rib also occurred on the butt side of the blade due to the extent of corrosion. Heavy corroded.



Dimensions (combination of two fragments): Weight: 197g; Length (of two fragments): c.128mm; (Max.) Thickness at stop ridges: 26mm



8. Copper alloy palstave ['4'] (Rowlands's Class 2, Group 2, side flanged). Possible to detect evidence of a medial rib between both stop ridge and blade edge and stop ridge and butt (for c.12mm). Broken and heavily eroded to butt end of the blade.



Dimensions: Weight: 187g; Length: 118mm; Width of cutting blade: 43mm



9. Copper alloy palstave ['5'] (Rowlands's Class 2, Group 2, side flanged). Medial rib running from stop ridge to the centre of the blade but not possible to detect whether a rib also ran from stop ridge to butt end. Smooth cutting blade showing evidence of use-wear. Both sides of the blade show overlapping/miscast seams.



Dimensions: Weight: 219g; Length: 137mm; Width of cutting blade: 61mm; (Max.) Thickness (at stop ridge): 23mm



10. Copper alloy palstave ['2'] (Rowlands's Class 2, Group 2, side flanged). Medial rib from stop ridge to blade edge but not possible to detect a medial rib between stop ridge and butt, probably partly due to heavy erosion in this area of the blade. Cutting blade is distorted and this may be an original feature.



Dimensions: Weight: 269g; Length: 135mm; Width of cutting blade: 57mm; Thickness (at stop ridge): 25mm



11. Eight pieces of very friable and deteriorated ?prehistoric pottery, possibly from a single vessel and seemingly of the same fabric type. There is a substantial amount of soil adhering to each sherd, serving to hold the friable fabric together in some cases. It is not possible to be confident regarding the original character of the vessel but it has angular white grits.

Non-associated finds



One additional find was made alongside this hoard:



12. Modern rectangular section of, incomplete, copper alloy tubing with join/seam.



Dimensions: Weight 6g; Length (incomplete): 37mm; Width: 16mm; Thickness: 4.5mm



This item appears not to have been associated with the Middle Bronze Age finds and therefore does not qualify as potential treasure.","Discussion 



At the broadest level, the objects in the Ockham hoard can be dated typo-chronologically to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC). More particularly, the early palstaves (Nos. 5-10), probably date to the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1250 BC) (cf. Rowlands 1976, 31-2), and possibly to the Acton Park metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) (cf. O'Connor 1980, 53). The two Sussex Loop bracelets (Nos. 1-2) and two spiral coiled finger rings (Nos. 3-4) belong to the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' of the Taunton and Penard phases (c.1400-1150 BC) (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).



As their name suggests, Sussex Loop armlets (or bracelets) are found in the county of Sussex, generally within 16 miles of Brighton (White 1991). The Ockham find is notable for having been found in Surrey and is the first certain find from outwith Sussex, to the author's knowledge. Spiral coiled finger rings are known from Southern England: Roberts (2007, appendix) lists ten examples, with recent additions from the 'Near Lewes' (2011 T192) hoard and the 'Near Wylye' hoard (2012 T786). Palstaves of Class 2 Group 2 are found throughout Southern England, with a strong concentration in the upper Thames (Rowlands 1976, map 4; O'Connor 1980, 52-3; see Discussion in Capper et al. for 2011 T192). Palstaves of Class 3 are rarer than Class 2 examples but have also been found throughout most of southern England, with concentrations in Kent and Hampshire (Rowlands 1976, map 5).



A notable feature of these finds is that eight of the twelve hoards include objects also found with the Ockham hoard: either arm-rings (or bracelets), Sussex Loops or palstaves. The most notable of these overlapping composition hoards are the Hollingbury Hoard, Sussex, which included a palstave, two Sussex Loops and a spiral twisted torc (Roberts 2007, appendix, no. 85; Rowlands 1976, 267), and Stump Bottom, Cissbury, also in Sussex, which comprised two Sussex Loops, three spiral coiled finger rings and several additional ornaments (Roberts 2007, appendix, no. 95; Rowlands 1976, 269). The Ockham hoard therefore shares its composition, as well as a unique armlet/bracelet type, in common with ornament horizon hoards from Sussex.



Conclusion



This case comprises of a find of more than two objects of base metal of prehistoric date (Nos. 1-10, above) and therefore qualifies as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), Designation Order (2002). The associated ceramic finds probably from one vessel (No. 11, above) also qualify as Treasure by association with the metalwork as it was probably deposited at the same time as part of a 'hoard' deposit.

561581,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1150,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy ingot, probably originally circular in plan and plano-convex in profile, but this fragment is rectangular in plan, square in profile and triangular in section, as it likely comes from the centre of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face and base of the ingot are smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and the sides of the fragment have ridges and cavities typically seen in the sections of these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), the neighbouring parish, which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

562892,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy late flanged axe (c. 1700-1500 BC). The blade of the axe is slightly flared to the blade tips, and the blade cutting edge is a deep symmetrical convex shape. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the flange facets. Body and haft end of the axe has almost straight sides which taper slightly at the butt, which is straight at the terminal. One face is possibly decorated at the junction of the body and blade, just within the facets, in the form on at least three short linear notches. However, there is a possibility this is damage from antiquity. The body of the axe has shallow (2.92mm deep) rounded flange facets, therefore in profile the facet sides are a pointed oval and taper down at the butt. The flange top/crests are in-turned therefore the width between the crests is narrower than the base. The surface has large patches of a green/brown coloured patina with areas of the surface missing, but not recently, and one patch of active corrosion. It is in a fair condition. The axe measures 147.36mm long, 53.71mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 24.06mm thick across the apex of the facets. It weighs 471.4g.



Ben Roberts (University of Durham) comments that the axe is a 'late flanged axe rather than a palstave which would date it to the latter part of the Early Bronze Age (c. 1700- 1500 BC)'. (pers comm). This type of axes are distributed across Britain, and few have been found in a datable context, therefore making it difficult to date them with accuracy (late flanged axe rather than a palstave which would date it to the latter part of the Early Bronze Age (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2013-04-08T23:00:00Z,,,471.4,,,24.06,147.36,1,Ben Roberts,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Malvern Hills,Rushwick,SO8155,From finder,52.1929072,-2.27937017,WAW-BA7221,,WAW-BA7221.jpg,"Bronze Age flat axe transitional palstave (plan, profile, plan and profile).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-BA7221.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/428439.jpg
562997,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy (bronze) axe most probably from a palstave of Middle Bronze Age date, circa 1500-1150 BC.   The blade is broken below the stop ridge and there is no evidence to suggest whether this fragment is from a looped - or unlooped palstave variant. The break is worn and patinated suggesting that it has been damaged in antiquity; only the lower blade of the axehead survives.  A casting error is present on one flange. The edge of one of the flanges has been flattened with the re-set copper alloy forming a lip.  The fragment has an irregular form in plan with the sides gently widening away from the slightly concave broken edge and terminating in asymmetrical flares due to the manufacturing error.  The cutting edge is lost but retains its convex form.  The fragment is sub-triangular in section.  The section at the break is sub-rectangular.  The surface of the fragment is heavily abraded with pitting and patches of light green patina.   There is no evidence of rib decoration.  Overall, the fragment has a mid green / brown colour.

Discussion: The combination of (socketed) tools, awls and ingot fragments suggests that this represents a Late Bronze Age (c.1000 - 700 BC) hoard.

564356,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,,,-1600,-1500,"An Early Bronze Age copper alloy flat axe head. In section, the axe head is lenticular in shape. In plan, the axe head is roughly triangular in shape; the butt end is narrow and has a rounded end, and the sides flare out towards the cutting edge. The cutting edge is cresentic in shape. There are signs of wear on the cutting edge, suggesting it has been used. There are also file marks visible on the surface of both faces, suggesting that the blade has been re-sharpened on the surface. Overall, the surface patina is smooth and dark green. A similar example, found in Dorset, can be seen on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database (DOR-422514), this example was compared to the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage by Kevin Leahy, and dated to 1600 to 1500 BC.

565100,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1001,"Bronze age copper alloy small spearhead, 52mm long, 12mm wide and 9mm thick. The object is in fair condition and weighs 14.13grams. The spearhead has a conical open shaft, (9mm in diameter)  which very gently tapers into an integral wide central mid rib running down a leaf shaped blade. This then drops sharply near the upper end to accommodate the thin blade. The edges of the blade and rib are damaged but are largely intact. The shaft is damaged, missing most of its length including the fixing hole. The section that remains has two sub-linear depressions, aligned parallel to the base, sitting on each side of the shaft, below the blade, possibly to aid fixing?  The object has an unusually short profile and wide shaft/ridge.


Dr Richard Davis has examined this object and has provided the following information,

This spearhead has a number of  interesting and rare attributes.
 
Firstly the decorative cuts on  the side of the socket. A number of side looped spearheads from the MBA have  such cuts. Drawings of these can be seen in my volume in the PBF series (Davis, R.  2012. The Early and Middle  Bronze Age spearheads of Britain. [PBF V.5]. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner).    These are no. 227 Rossington, no 276 Matlock Bath, no 307 Irlam, no 347  Waddingham, no 381 Malham Dale, no 413 Cressbrook, no 629 Eyemouth.   No 594  Harpur Hill has crosses rather than horizontal cuts. You can see that  distribution of this attribute is centred on the Peak District.
 
A couple of other points are of  interest. The midrib ends shortly below the tip, and the blade flattens at this  point. This is characteristic of the kite blade, side looped spearheads (my  Group 3) and the spearheads with wide blade, side loops and shortened midrib (my  Group 5). Both of these groups are dated to the Acton Park phase.
 
The spearhead is very short at   52mm remaining, possibly around 70mm when complete. There were some short  spearheads in the MBA, and they had rounded kite shaped blades. Examples are my  no. 151 from Nottingham at 78mm in length and no. 153 Swindon at 68mm in length.  Again these can be dated to the Acton Park phase.
 
In summary it is possible that  this spearhead originally had side loops on the lower part of the socket, which  have now broken off. This would be dated to the Acton Park and early Taunton  phases of the MBA.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,2013-05-01T23:00:00Z,,,14.13,,,9,52,1,Kevin Leahy,Wendy Scott,East Midlands,Leicestershire,Hinckley and Bosworth,Sutton Cheney,SK3900,GPS (from the finder),52.59640132,-1.42567007,LEIC-F0A3B8,,LEIC-F0A3B8.jpg,LEIC-F0A3B8 Bronze age copper alloy spearhead,Leicestershire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/LEIC-F0A3B8.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/430066.jpg

Fragment of a middle to late Bronze Age copper-alloy palstave. Only the butt remains. The fragment is triangular in profile and has a curved butt. The edges extend to form a narrow ledge at the top and bottom. The break exposes two circular indentations that appear to have been caused by air bubbles formed during the casting process. The presence of these indentations may have caused this area of the axe to have been particularly weak, thus causing the break. The break is roughly straight, but irregular enough to suggest it is not an intentional cut.

The socket is formed by a set of right angled flanges which flank the flat central area and increase in height towards the centre of the blade where they are joined by a horizontal stop ridge. The flanges are slightly damaged along the topmost edge on both sides, with heavy pitting on the outward facing sides of each flange. Immediately below the stop ridge is a shield shaped depression. The blade has inward-bowing sides which flare towards the bottom, the thickness tapering to the point where it terminates in a convex cutting edge. There is evidence of a vertical casting seam along the narrower surfaces of the object with tool-marks indicating that this was filed down during finishing. The presence of a casting seam indicates the use of a two-piece mould in production. The flanges and the shield shaped depression also carry tool marks.


Much of the palstave is heavily corroded and carries a green colouring with patches of bright blue discolouration.

From the PAS website: http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl Awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin. Dating and areas of discovery 


Date: most probably 1250-800 BC

570342,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy palstave with raised flange facets dating from the Middle Bronze Age (1500 BC - 1150 BC).


The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and an incomplete convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 96.18 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 56.31 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 3.33 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 17.36mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 29.15 mm).


The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 65.75 mm long, 16.03 mm wide, and 6.73 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving two rounded corners with a gap between. The butt is 25.13 mm wide and 5.54 mm thick. 


The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by. 


In total the palstave measures 166 mm in length, 56.54 mm wide (maximum) and 36.48 mm thick. It weighs 471.1 g.


Several casting flaws in the form of air bubbles are present on the septum. The poor quality of the casting is confirmed by an xray of the palstave which demostrated several large air bubbles within the internal structure of the palstave. XRF (X Ray Fluorescence) of the surface corrosion indicates that the palstave has a composition of 76.24% Copper (Cu), 14.62% Tin (Sn), 0.48% Lead (Pb) and 0.41% Iron (Fe).


The palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface. The palstave has been kindly cleaned stabilised by Aimee Sims (Conservation Department, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery).


Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in Savory, 1980; catalogue entries 171, 172, 175, and 263 (the Mynydd Ta-y-glannau, Cemmaes Hoard). All of these examples fit into the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II).

Discussion


The narrow-bladed looped palstaves (also termed Transitional or Late palstaves) dates the hoard to the Penard-Wilburton metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1300 - 1000 BC) (see Rowlands 1976, 38; Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160). The remaining copper alloy objects are undiagnostic metalworking waste or associated stones. The gold bar is also undiagnostic but the gold coiled bar is paralleled in Middle Bronze Age Towednack hoard, Cornwall (Hawkes 1932) which can also be provisionally dated to the Penard metalwork phase (c. 1300-1100 BC). The presence of this gold ornamentation together with the dating from the narrow-bladed looped palstave places this hoard within the gold phase of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' (Roberts 2007). The presence of gold ornaments deposited together with copper alloy palstaves during this period has been recorded in several hoards throughout southwest England such as Winterhay Green, Somerset (Rowlands 1976, 256).


Conclusion

The objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

1. Plain socketed axe of Type Portree - near complete. 



Length 100.5mm; surviving blade width 58.1mm; external mouth dimensions 47.2mm by 38.2mm; weight 276.3g. 



Near complete bronze socketed axe with angular face edges and sub-rectangular cross-section. The loop is missing and there is some peripheral damage to the out-turned blade edge. The axe has an onset collar below the mouth and the axe was cast with mismatching mould halves, the collar on one side being markedly deeper than on the other. The surface has a dark grey-green and black patina, with small patches of light green corrosion around the mouth and along the blade edge.



2. Ribbed socketed axe fragment 



Surviving length 42.8mm; surviving width 23.5mm; weight 27.4g. 



Small mouth and partial face fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset collar. Two narrow raised ribs are visible, descending from the underside of the collar down the long axis of the surviving upper face. The fragment is markedly bent near the lower face break, suggesting deliberate force in breakage during antiquity. The surface displays a dark grey-green patina.



3. Ribbed socketed axe fragment 



Surviving Length 60.6mm; surviving width 23.1mm; weight 55.1g. 



Small mouth and upper body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth moulding is out-turned but poorly defined, the mouth top uneven and imperfectly cast. Two raised narrow ribs extend down one upper face, while a single rib survives on the reverse axe face. The other rib is represented only partially by a short narrow rib on the edge of the break. This fragment has been bent in antiquity, one surviving face section being pressed together against the other, while the lower face break is also distorted inwards. The surface has a grey-green patina.



4. Plain or faceted socketed axe fragment 



Surviving length 37.4mm; surviving width 40.4mm; weight 27.2g. 



Small upper face and side fragment of a plain or faceted socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset and well-defined collar. The original outer face has been deliberately bent inside out, making the original inner socket face convex and appear to be the outer surface, on first view. The surface a dark grey-green patina.



5. Socketed axe fragment 



Surviving length 35.5mm; surviving width 22.7mm; weight 33.3g. 



Small middle face and side fragment of a socketed axe of bronze, with a prominent casting seam. No ribs are visible on the surviving face. The fragment has been forcibly distorted and broken in antiquity and there is twisting and inner face cracking evident. The surface has a dark grey-green patina. 6.-8. Three fragments of a single and incomplete Plain Pegged Spearhead Estimated original length of complete spearhead 270-300mm Combined surviving weight 134.7g. This was originally a large spearhead of Plain Pegged type, with a lanceolate or flame-shaped blade.



6. Spearhead socket and lower blade fragment 



Length 96.4mm; external diameter of socket 25.8-26.1mm; maximum width 32.0mm; weight 67.3g. 



Socket and lower blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze. The circular socket has slightly convex sides, giving it an external barrel-shaped profile. Two circular peg holes (each 5.5-6.5mm in diameter) are located 34.5-34.7mm from the mouth end of the socket. The spear blade has a pronounced and stepped blade bevel, the blade edge merging with the socket at a shallow and even angle. The lower blade wall thickness varies markedly on each face, suggesting casting imperfections. The break is uneven and occurred in antiquity, creating a small tear on one lower blade face. Areas of bronze metal are evident, with patches of dark grey and dark green patination also present.



7. Spearhead blade fragment 



Surviving length 65.4mm; surviving width 39.9mm; maximum thickness 12.1mm; weight 46.6g. 



Middle blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead tip fragment 8 (below). The spearhead has a prominent mid-ridge, which is lozenge shaped in cross-section, and a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. The fragment is bent at both ends, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. Impact scars on one lower face suggests that the spearhead was bent and broken by being struck with a blunt bladed implement. The blade edges are badly corroded and damaged with pale green corrosion surfaces. The faces have a grey-green patination, one face being well preserved with crisp definition and lustre and the other being markedly rough, with a dull corrosion surface.



8. Spearhead blade tip fragment 



Surviving length 54.2mm; surviving width 23.5mm; maximum thickness 9.7mm; weight 20.6g. 



This is a tip fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead middle blade fragment 7 (above). The tip fragment has a prominent mid-ridge, tapering at the end to form a solid tip, also with a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. Bending is evident near the break, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. One blade edge and side is badly damaged and corroded with pale green and unstable corrosion surfaces, which also extends across one side of the break point. The surface has a grey-green patina.



9. Penannular bracelet - fragment with terminal 



Surviving length 68.6mm; diameter of terminal 16.7 by 14.5mm; hoop diameter 5.4mm by 5.1mm; weight 22.9g. 



A fragment of a bronze penannular bracelet with an expanded oval-shaped terminal, representing between one third and one half of the original bracelet. The hoop has a near circular cross-section, though with slight flattening along the inner circumference, and was broken in antiquity. The bracelet had an internal front to back diameter of approximately 50mm and it is estimated that it once had an internal side to side diameter of 71-76mm. The bracelet surfaces have a green patina.



10. Ingot or recycled bronze fragment-- near complete 



Maximum height 55.5mm; diameter of base 74.0mm; maximum width 77.4mm; weight 670.4g.



Bronze ingot or re-smelted bronze fragment. The molten metal was cooled inside the base of a ceramic vessel, set into the ground surface at an angle, so cooling into one half of the base and up one side of the interior vessel side-surface. The vessel once had an external base diameter of 105-115mm. The upper cooling surface is rough and irregular, while the underside surfaces have surface vesicles, representing air bubbles in the molten metal as it cooled. The base surface is slightly concave, while the side diverges and become wider with a convex profile, taking the contours of the internal vessel surface. A small fragment of the whole piece was removed in antiquity near the top of the body side. The upper cooling surface has a green patina, while the underside has large areas of light green surface corrosion with small areas of dark-green patina surviving.



11. Plano-convex ingot/cake fragment 



Surviving length 40.7mm; max. surviving width 62.7mm; max. thickness 13.3mm; weight 119.6g. 



Plano-convex ingot/cake fragment of bronze, representing one long-axis end of an irregular oval-shaped cake. The upper cooling surface is irregular and uneven. The lower surface is convex in shape, though uneven with slight flattening near the break, which was made in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



12. Single-runner casting-jet - complete 



Maximum height 29.1mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 35.2mm by 27.2mm; length of runner 13.7 mm; max. width of runner 12.5mm; weight 50.6g. 



A complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a near flat upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards steeply with a convex form on one side and a concave form on the other. A single, narrow and prominent runner extends from the central base of the reservoir aligned parallel with the long-axis of the reservoir. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



13. Single-runner casting-jet - complete 



Maximum height 31.4mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 30.2mm by 23.3mm; length of runner 6.5mm; width of runner 21.1mm; weight 50.5g. 



A complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough, uneven and concave upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a straight to slightly convex profile. A wide and single runner extends from under the base of the reservoir, being the same width as the base width of the reservoir. The runner has been snapped off just a short distance (6.5mm) from the reservoir base. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



14. Small single-runner casting-jet - complete 



Maximum height 16.0mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 23.5mm by 19.2 mm; weight 13.9g. 



A small single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan, with a rough, uneven upper surface, with a significant hollowing at its centre. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a slightly convex profile. Prominent but thin seams of metal have extruded between joins in the upper mould and parallel with the long axis of the jet. The reservoir has been snapped off near its base, with no clear runner stub evident. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



15. Four-runner casting-jet - half fragment 



Maximum height 27.1mm; top surface length 52.2mm; maximum surviving width 24.8mm; length of runners 19.1mm & 13.8mm; maximum width of runners at base 13.2 & 13.4mm; weight 47.2g. 



Half fragment of a large four-runner casting jet of bronze, created during the casting of a South Wales type socketed axe. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough and uneven upper surface. The reservoir tapers and is shallow with a central perforation and uneven depth, deepest in proximity to the two surviving runner stubs. The runners are wide and prominent. Both runners are broken below the base of the reservoir. The break lines have even corrosion suggesting they occurred in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



16. Dried out wood fragments (3) 



Surviving lengths: 56.3mm, 44.9mm & 32.7mm; maximum surviving widths 11.0mm, 11.8mm & 14.7mm; weights 1.1g, 0.6g & 0.4g (combined 2.1g). 



Three small and elongate wood fragments, showing severe shrinking, cracking and warping, due to the drying out process inevitably speeded up by the removal of the wood from its burial context. Careful inspection under the microscope reveals no visible evidence of working and shaping of the wood, however the drying out and shrinking process hinders the identification of possible shape, form and working evidence. The wood fragments merit retaining and safe care as material for possible future radiocarbon dating samples and the potential for independent absolute dating of the burial of the hoard.



Metallurgical analysis (Mary Davis) 



Qualitative and non-destructive surface analysis was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken with 40 kV and 3A for 100 live seconds. There was no surface preparation of the artefacts; the relatively high kV setting would have allowed penetration of the X-rays through corrosion layers, and resulting spectra could be compared with those from similar artefacts, but would not allow for the production of quantitative data.



Results: The ingot or recycled bronze fragment (No. 10) and plano-convex ingot or cake fragment (No. 11) were both found to be of leaded bronze in composition.","Discussion (Adam Gwilt & Simone L Johnson)



The fifteen metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).



The near complete socketed axe (No. 1) most resembles a plain form known as Type Portree, which has a flaring onset collar, with a sub-rectangular body section, with concave sides and an expanded cutting edge (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 184). Parallel examples have been found within secure Ewart Park hoards from Pendoylan, Vale of Glamorgan and Llanddewi Rhydderch, Monmouthshire (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 276 & Fig. 41; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 187; Green 1985, 276-80, Fig. 5 & Pl. 5; Northover unpublished, H.79 & H.119). Plain socketed axes of slightly different forms have also been found within a further eleven hoards from Wales with secure Ewart Park associations, including the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire, Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire hoards (Briggs & Williams 1995, 46 & Fig. 4.1; Northover unpublished H. 38, 76 & 140; Wear unpublished). It is possible that the plain or faceted socketed axe fragment (No. 4) could be another example of Type Portree, however it is not entirely diagnostic and could equally have once belonged to a faceted axe of Type Gillespie (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 191).



Two socketed axe fragments belonged to ribbed socketed axes (Nos. 2 & 3), however insufficient survives to identify them with certainty to type. However, the narrow but pronounced collars, without upper or lower mouldings and parallel ribs, suggest that these fragments once probably belonged to South Wales Type or South Wales Variant socketed axes (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2; Needham 1981; 1990, 38-41; Northover unpublished, 259). This probable attribution is further strengthened by the four-runner casting jet (No. 15) which was definitely created during the casting of a South Wales Type socketed axe, a four-runner casting technology being a distinctive and diagnostic technology for this particular socketed axe form (Needham 1981, 27; Northover unpublished, 259). South Wales type socketed axes are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), though they are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and southern England (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66). Six examples have been found in the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire hoard (Briggs & Williams 1995), with further single examples in the Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoards (Northover unpublished H. 76; Wear unpublished; Gwilt et al unpublished). Four-runner casting jets have been discovered within a number of secure Ewart Park hoards from south east Wales: St Mellons (Cardiff), Llangybi (Monmouthshire), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Cowbridge, St Nicholas and Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan) (e.g. Stanton 1984; Gwilt 2004; unpublished; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished).



The three spearhead fragments (Nos. 6-8) were once part of a single and large Plain Pegged spearhead approximately 27-30cm long. A similar long-bladed spearhead is known in the St Fagans, Cardiff hoard (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 273 & Fig. 40). The mid-blade and tip fragments (Nos. 7 & 8) are joining fragments, though the mid to lower blade section of this spearhead is missing. Plain Pegged spearheads as an artefact class generally span in date from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of similar Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800BC. In Wales, there are twelve other known hoards of Ewart Park date which include Plain Pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen, Manorbier (both Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (both Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llantarnam (Torfaen), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick unpublished a; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished). The barrel-shaped profile of the socket of the St Ishmael spearhead is a late feature, generally observed amongst spearheads in Ewart Park hoards (Richard Davis pers comm), for example in the Wick Park (Somerset), Heathery Burn Cave (Durham), St Fagans (Cardiff), St Nicholas Llantwit Major and Cowbridge (all Vale of Glamorgan) hoards (Britton 1968; McNeil 1973, 48-9 & Figs. 6-7; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats 273 & 281, Figs 40 & 42) . The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, this spearhead is thought on stylistic grounds to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).



The penannular bracelet or armlet fragment (No. 9) may be identified as of British, rather than Irish form, by comparison with other gold and bronze bracelet types (Eogan 1994, 85-88). Its precise characteristics include a near round-sectioned hoop but with a slight flattening of the inner circumference, an expanding terminal with slight inward expansion but more pronounced outward expansion and with a solid, flat ended but oval shaped terminal. This would seem to share characteristics with Covesea type / British Variety 7 and British Variety 9 bracelets (Coles 1959-60; Eogan 1994, 85). In Wales, the two closest parallels are a bronze example from The Breiddin hillfort, Powys and a bronze bracelet in the St Nicholas hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Coombs 1991, 136-8, Cat. 159, Fig. 56; Gwilt et al 2005, 55, Appendix 3, 13 & 15; Gwilt unpublished). The former has a thicker hoop, but shares a slight internal expansion of the terminal but with a more pronounced external expansion, while the latter has an oval-sectioned hoop and an oval shaped terminal, but expanding equally both internally and externally. The bracelet from The Breiddin was associated with a Late Bronze Age hillfort occupation phase (Musson 1991, 177-8) and was generally associated with metalwork of Ewart Park date (Coombs 1991, 132-41), while the St Nicholas hoard also has secure Ewart Park associations.



Casting jets (Nos. 12-15) only become common discoveries within hoard associations during the Late Bronze Age. These are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, with thirteen other hoards of secure Ewart Park date from Wales now known to include them: the Penwyllt (Powys), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Penarth, Cowbridge, St Nicholas, Llancarfan, Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Llantarnam (Torfaen), St Mellons (Cardiff), Glascoed and Llangybi (both Monmouthshire) hoards (Savory 1980, 120-22, Cats. 274, 281 284; Stanton 1984; Gwilt, 2004, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 & 4; 2008; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished).



Plano-convex ingots (No. 11) of copper and bronze are common components of Ewart Park hoards. Over 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan 1 and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex bronze ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). The Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoard contained eight copper ingot fragments as a major component of the hoard (Gwilt et al unpublished), while the Freshwater Bay, Pembrokeshire hoard included twenty three fragments of plano-convex ingot fragments of copper (Murphy unpublished; Northover unpublished). The ingot or recycled bronze fragment cooled in a ceramic vessel (No. 10) has been shown to be of leaded bronze composition, a typical Late Bronze Age signature and consistent with the other artefacts and the plano-convex ingot fragment. Inclusion of such material is consistent with the frequent inclusion of casting bi-products and ingot material in hoards of Ewart Park date (1000-800BC).



The small dried out wood fragments (No. 16 above) were directly associated with the hoard, having been found next to the near complete socketed axe (No. 1). Although it now proves difficult to detect clear evidence for the deliberate working of these fragments, in part dues to the drying out process, nevertheless it may be possible to identify the species of the wood through micro-sampling and microscopy work. In addition, this organic material could provide valuable radiocarbon dating samples, in order to gain independent dating evidence for the burial of the hoard.



The archaeological findspot investigation, undertaken with the assistance of the finder, enabled the details of the reported depths and an account of the relative positioning of artefacts to be clarified. Hand excavation of a test pit over the location of the rediscovered findspot indicated that the metal detector pit, created when the artefacts were retrieved from the ground, had removed all evidence of the original burial context. No further artefacts were discovered during the archaeological investigation. However, the base of a small pit feature was discovered adjacent to the location of the hoard. This contained an undisturbed fill incorporating occasional flecks of charcoal - suggesting human activity rather than being naturally derived. The evidence suggests that the hoard was originally buried as a single closed deposit of directly associated artefacts in a single small pit, one of a pair of isolated pits, seemingly located remote from any known Late Bronze Age settlements. A search of the Heritage Environment Record for the locality indicated the existence of possible Bronze Age standing stones a few hundred metres to the north east of the findspot, although their prehistoric date remains questionable (Marion Page pers comm). However, it seemed probable that the siting of the hoard was, in part, selected for its landscape location, with its dramatic coastal views.

The surface of the axe is corroded and worn and appears to be displaying active copper corrosion, rendering identification of the surface, and any possible decoration, impossible.


The axe measures 84mm in length, 34mm in width and 11mm in thickness. It weighs 78.94g. Such axes were current in the Willerby Wold phase of the early Bronze Age, currently dated circa 1900-1700 BC.","This object was reported to Dr Paul Sealey, of Colchester and Ipswich Museums, and images of the axehead were obtained by scanning the object which were supplied to the FLO for recording.

572333,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"The hoard comprises two associated Bronze Age artefacts:



Plain pegged spearhead fragment



Maximum surviving length 61.3mm; maximum surviving blade width 18.3mm; maximum surviving socket height 13.0mm; maximum blade thickness near break 8.0mm. Weight 22.8g. 



This is the lower blade side and upper socket side of a bronze socketed spearhead. The blade edge has a defined bevel approximately 5mm wide. The interior of the blade is slightly hollowed out immediately adjacent to where the central and circular rib cavity once existed. The blade edge merges with the socket with a shallow and gradual angle, with no nick or break of slope. The even convex curve of the lower blade suggests the spearhead once had a leaf or flame shaped form. The fragment has a dark brown patina and appears to have been coated with oil since discovery.



Single-runner casting jet 



Maximum top surface length 33.8mm; maximum top surface width 26.8mm; depth 23.1mm; length of runner near break 15.4mm; width runner near break 3.9mm. Weight 50.7g. 



This is a single-runner bronze casting jet, oval in plan, with a rough and uneven tope surface. One underside long axis has a near straight profile with a lower inward tapering step, while the opposing side is more steeply undercut, with a slightly concave profile. The underside break is worn and eroded, making it difficult to establish the original dimensions of the casting runner with any precision. The patina is dark green with lighter green edges and breaks.","The plain pegged spearhead fragment can be confidently identified as of Middle to Late Bronze Age date and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). The shape of the surviving blade edge is consistent with either a leaf shaped or flame shaped blade. In Wales, early examples of similar plain pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 950-800BC. In Wales, there are eleven other known hoards of Ewart Park date which included plain pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen (Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (all Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; 2008; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick unpublished; Gwilt et al, in prep). The wooden hafts of a number of plain pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to this period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, on a balance of probability, this spearhead is thought most likely to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 950BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).





Casting jets only become common discoveries within hoard associations during the Late Bronze Age. These are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date (950-800BC), with thirteen other hoards of secure Ewart Park date from Wales now known to include them: the Penwyllt (Powys), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Penarth, Cowbridge, St Nicholas, Llancarfan, Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), St Mellons (Cardiff), Glascoed and Llangybi (both Monmouthshire) hoards (Savory 1980, 120-22, Cats. 274, 281 284; Stanton 1984; Gwilt, 2004, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 & 4; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished; Gwilt et al, unpublished; Gwilt et al, in prep). Therefore, on a balance of probability, the casting jet is thought most likely to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (950-800BC).





To summarise, plain pegged spearheads and casting jets are contemporary in their dating to between 1020-800BC, during the Blackmoor and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age, although a Ewart Park date (950-800BC) is the most likely, on a balance of probability.

572343,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-950,-750,"Two bronze socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date 1.0 South Wales Variant Type socketed axe Length 101.0mm; blade width 50.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 354.9g. This is a complete bronze socketed axe of slender and rectangular form. The mouth moulding is deeper (approx. 10mm), thicker and less outsplayed than is typical of the type and the loop extends from the underside of the moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped mouth in plan view with four runner scars around the top surface, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent and concave sides expanding slightly near the blade edge. Three longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding down both faces of the axe, on one face being parallel and on the other slightly convergent. Both local prominences and gaps in the ribs suggest the re-use of a previously well used mould set. Casting flashes down the sides of the axe have been finished by rapid hammering, though remain prominent. There is little visible evidence of blade preparation on the one surviving blade bevel, the other original surface having been removed by corrosion. The axe has been deliberately damaged in antiquity and prior to burial, as evidenced by three impact scars, two on the mid-face on one side and one on the mid-face of the other. The shape of the scars suggests impact with another thick bladed implement, such as an axe. The axe has a grey-green patina, with small areas of lighter green patination and corrosion around the mouth and blade edges. 2.0 South Wales Type socketed axe Surviving length 79.2mm; surviving blade width 42.0mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 205.9g. This is a virtually complete bronze socketed axe, which is small and rectangular in cross-section. The blade edge and bevel has been badly damaged and corroded. The axe has an outsplayed mouth moulding and a high loop. The external mouth is sub-oval in plan view however the internal edge is rectangular in shape. Four prominent and un-filed runner stubs protrude around the moth top, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent but straight sides, widening slightly at the balde end. Three very prominent and near parallel longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding down both faces of the axe. Gaps and variable heights and rib definition on one face suggest the re-use of a well used mould piece. The face edges on both faces are slightly raised (though less prominent than the ribs) giving a pronounced angular profile. Prominent casting flashes down the sides indicate minimal preparation after casting by rapid hammering. The blade edge is damaged, though striations on the blade bevels and parallel with the blade edge indicate some preparation of the blade. The axe has a dark green patination, with areas of pale green corrosion around the mouth and blade edge. On one upper face, there are small patches of blue-green corrosion, consistent with possible burning of the axe before burial. These two bronze socketed axes were buried during the Ewart Park pahse of the Late Bronze Age and date to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). South Wales Type axes and their Variants were commonly made and used in south east Wales at this time (McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980; Needham 1981). Over 30 hoards containing more than 140 examples are known from this region (e.g. Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), making it the core area within Britain for their burial in hoards. In Monmouthshire, the Llangwm, Glascoed, Coed Ithel, Llanddewi Rhydderch, Llantilio Pertholey, Llanvihangel Gobion and St Arvans hoards contain examples of these ribbed socketed axes (e.g. Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 2). A further forty single examples of South Wales type axe finds are now also known from south east Wales, with a further fifteen from the rest of Wales. However, they were also made and used across south western and central southern England, either as minor components of hoards or as single finds. A few examples circulated as far as northern Britain, Ireland and northern France (McNeil 1973, Appendix 63-4; Moore 1978, Appendix I, 61-5; Needham 1981, Appendix, 56-66). The discovery of two South Wales Type socketed axes in close proximity (approximately 2.5m apart from each other), strongly suggests that they were once buried as a hoard in direct association with each other. Their slight dispersal is most convincingly explained as caused by recent ploughing activity, leading to their dislodgement from an original burial context and dispersal into the overlying ploughsoil. Archaeological investigation of the approximate area of the find-spot for the larger socketed axe (No. 1 above) failed to reveal evidence for the recent detector pit, in which the axe was found. However, the recently disturbed upper ploughsoil was observed to be 0.25-0.30m deep here, while the larger axe was reported as found at a depth of 0.17-0.20m . Even allowing for the slight thickening of the ploughsoil caused by recent ploughing activity (i.e. loosening and aeration of the soil), it is likely that the three recent detector pits were all almost entirely restricted to within the ploughsoil layer. This provides additional evidence in support of the interpretation that the axes had recently been disturbed from their original burial context - probably a small Bronze Age pit - and dragged upwards into the ploughsoil during a recent ploughing event.",,3,Copper alloy,,Donated to museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2011-09-30T23:00:00Z,,2011W17,,,,,,,2,Mark Lodwick,Adam Gwilt,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Trellech United,SO5109,,51.77751,-2.71163,NMGW-4D8933,,Axespresentation.JPG,Late Bronze Age associated socketed axes,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Axespresentation.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/436025.jpg
572421,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A bronze socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date and a worked and hook-shaped metal fragment



1. Faceted and socketed axe



(Dimensions: length 91.2mm; surviving blade width 43.6mm; external mouth dimensions 36.8 by 34.4mm, internal mouth dimensions 26.9 by 24.2mm; width below loop 32.8mm; height of collar 18.2mm; depth of socket approximately 67.0mm; surviving weight (after removal of haft fragment but before conservation) 183.9g).



This is a near complete, slender and faceted axe with an octagonal cross-section. The axe has a deep octagonal shaped collar, with a slightly flaring or trumpet-shaped mouth, which is sub-octagonal in plan shape. The loop is placed low down, the upper end emerging from the lower margin of the collar. The sides are near straight but slightly divergent and the blade edge does not widen markedly. A casting seam is evident down both sides of the axe, only partially removed and flattened by hammering or filing down. Striations on the blade bevel, both parallel and at right angles to the blade edge, suggest that the blade was sharpened. Areas of eroded surface damage are evident on one collar face and upper blade, with similar damage also to the blade edge and on the non-loop lower blade side. The axe has a dark brown patina, the eroded surfaces being mid to dark green.



2. Hook-shaped base metal fragment 



(Dimensions: maximum length 57.0mm; maximum curved width 37.5mm; surviving top width 12.8mm; surviving length at top 16.5mm; surviving width 20mm from tapering tip end 9.5mm; surviving thickness 20mm from tapering tip end 6.7mm; internal hollow mouth dimensions 11.5 by 7.6mm; depth of top hollow cavity approximately 9.0mm; surviving weight 40.3g.)



This is a differentially corroded hook-shaped dense base-metal object, with a hollowed out and sub-rectangular shaped top and a tapering narrow tip end with an oval-shaped cross-section. In form and size it resembles the tusk of a pig or wild boar. Original, but now longitudinally cracking surfaces survive on the interior concave curved side however original surfaces are almost entirely missing on the exterior convex shaped side. Microscope examination of the exterior surface suggests a small area of original surface survives approximately 18-22mm from the tapering tip end, indicating that the object was probably originally tapered in shape and not broken or differentially eroded here. The original surfaces have a dark grey black patina, while the corroded surfaces are a mottled light to mid-grey colour.



3. Wooden axe haft fragment (& small wood fragments) 



(Dimensions: maximum surviving length 51.8mm; width at top end approximately 24.0mm; base length 19.0mm; base width 3.1mm; surviving weight after drying 4.3g).



A shaped wooden axe haft fragment, fitted to the contours of the axe socket interior. The haft tapers in the axis parallel to the blade edge, though remains long and narrow at the lower end. The mouth end of the wood fragment has a damaged and concave surface, compression, fragmentation and twisting contributing to the loss of original shape here. This may have occurred recently, when the finder removed and re-inserted the haft fragment soon after discovery, or it could alternatively relate to ancient impact damage to the wood in the socket by a round and blunt ended tool.","Discussion (Adam Gwilt)



The faceted and socketed axe may be identified as of Type Gillespie (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 191-4), equating with Class 9A socketed axes in Ireland (Eogan 2000, 62-81). These may be confidently dated by secure hoard associations to the late Wilburton and Ewart Park phases (late Bishopsland and Dowris phases in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age, between 1050 and 800BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 193-4; Eogan 2000, 80; Needham 1996, 134-7; Needham et al 1997; Northover unpublished 267-9). In Wales, the Llanarmon yn Iâl (Denbighshire), Llansantffraed Cwmdeuddwr (Powys), Llanddewi Rhydderch and Llangwm (both Monmouthshire), Old Kemeys (Newport), Fairwater (Cardiff) and Welsh St Donats (Vale of Glamorgan) hoards, all of Ewart Park and Late Bronze Age date, contain single examples of Type Gillespie faceted axes (Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 276, 278 & 282; Green 1983; Gwilt & Macdonald 2000; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Cats. 1 &7; Northover unpublished, Hoards 49,67,119 &145). The survival of wooden haft fragments inside the socket of the axe raises the possibility that the axe was deposited in the ground complete with its haft still attached, although it is equally likely that the haft was broken prior to deposition, with only the socket fragment entering the ground at the time of burial. The wooden haft may be species identified at future date and a wood sample may be taken, from which an independent radiocarbon date for the axe may be obtained.





Careful examination of the hook-shaped tin object suggests it was deliberately shaped as an attachment or handle to a larger object, although the possibilities of it being an unusually shaped adornment, talisman or ingot cannot be discounted. The hollowed-out, widened and sub-rectangular shaped top would appear to have been the point of attachment to a larger composite object, the head slotting into a peg or projecting fitting. Observation of the narrowing end with a microscope gives tentative support for it having been deliberately shaped and tapered, rather than the outcome of differential corrosion and damage since burial. This suggests that it was only secured at one, rather than two ends. It is possible that the tin hook was once the hidden core of a handle or attachment with a sheet or cast bronze outer surface. This may have improved the weighting of the handle and the mode of securing it to the larger object, or it may have been added for reasons more closely linked with the wider meanings and symbolisms attached to tin as a special metal with specific properties. The discovery of the hook-shaped tin object within the same detector pit and less than 18cm from the socketed axe is consistent with a close and direct association. On a balance of probability, this favours their burial together at the same time during the Late Bronze Age, as opposed to being a fortuitous association of an ancient with a tin object of more recent manufacture in historical times.



Tin was an essential metal during the Bronze Age, alloyed with copper to form bronze, with the most likely source of tin being located in Cornwall (e.g. Pearce 1983, 92-7). As such, it would have been an important and valued exchanged material, requiring long-distance transport to bronze casting centres across Britain in some quantities. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, much tin would have been carried alloyed within existing old bronze objects and scrap destined for recycling, however some was also transported as metal fragments of irregular shape and as ingots, although the latter still prove difficult to date with accuracy (Way 1859, 38-40; Smith 1872, 435-39; Evans 1881, 424-6; Pearce 1983, 384 & 407, Cat. 52) and remain remarkably rare archaeological finds.



A preliminary literature search has produced two known Late Bronze Age hoards with objects or fragments of tin directly associated. The Llangwyllog (Anglesey) hoard included a fragment of tin, interpreted as possibly a damaged or miscast ornament, and dates to the contemporary Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Stanley 1865; Way 1866; Lynch 1991, 242-6 & Fig. 68; Northover 1997, 250; unpublished 274-86, Hoard 13). The Auchtertyre (Morayshire, Scotland) hoard, comprising a bronze socketed axe, two bronze spearheads and seven penannular bronze armlets, also included four fragments of tin (Smith 1872, 435-9; Evans 1881, 425; Coles 1959-60, 120-1). These were oval-sectioned and curved as if once part of a curved bar or ring, with one illustrated example suggesting it was slightly wider and thicker at one end (Smith 1872, 435). Unfortunately these no longer survive in the collections of the National Museums of Scotland (T. Cowie pers comm.), so their precise form cannot be compared with the hook-shaped tin fragment from Treuddyn. When chemically analysed soon after their discovery, the tin fragments were found to be made of a tin-lead alloy (78.66% tin, 21.34% lead). The socketed axe in the Auchtertyre hoard is of similar form of faceted axe (Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham) as the Treuddyn example and also of the same date (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 206-7, Cat. 1234). The two socketed spearheads are of Late Bronze Age form and the Covesea type bronze armlets may be equated with the Ewart Park tradition of the Late Bronze Age (Coles 1959-60, 34-5, 54-5; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 206-7 & Pl. 144C; Eogan 1994, 85).



Objects of tin dating to the Late Bronze Age have been discovered in a number of watery places in Britain and Wales and probably associated with votive and religious practice. For example, sixteen tin objects were reported from a votive context near a timber causeway into a watery fen at Flag Fen in Cambridgeshire (Coombs 2001, 291). These included wheel models, purse-shaped ornaments, rings and beads, the former finding close parallel with Late Bronze Age examples in Switzerland (Northover 1997, 250). A further object of possible Late Bronze Age date from this site was a shale bracelet with inlayed insets of 'white metal' (lead or tin) in a zig-zag design (Coombs 2001, 280, Cat. 257 & Fig. 10.10). Recent analytical research of a large penannular gold ring of Late Bronze Age date, held in The British Museum collections, has shown that the gold is plated onto a core of tin, containing 6% lead Meeks et al 2008, 14-17, 23-4, Fig 1.xvii). A decorated grooved strip of tin was discovered near a timber causeway in a wet palaeochannel context, and securely dated to the Late Bronze Age, at Caldicot, Monmouthshire (Northover 1997, 250; Nayling & Caseldine 1997, 265-8). The Caergwrle bowl, in the form of a boat model is made of Kimmeridge shale and has decorative tin insets forming wave and oar motifs, and also applied to the rim as a ground metal, onto which shield motifs could be stamped (Davis pers comm.). These were covered with decorative gold foil. This unique artefact may be dated to the slightly earlier Penard phase at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC). It was discovered in boggy ground next to the River Alyn near Caergwrle Castle in 1823 and was probably a carefully placed religious or votive gift (e.g. Barnwell 1875; Savory 1980, 127, Cat. 306; Davis 2011). To conclude this rapid overview of tin finds, discovered as fragments, ingots, in hoard associations and in religious watery deposits, a Late Bronze Age and contemporary association of a faceted bronze socketed axe with a hook-shaped tin object is plausible and consistent with the wider evidence.



Further support for the Treuddyn find representing a genuine Late Bronze Age association can be gathered by comparison with the content of two other Ewart Park hoards known within the region. The Llanarmon-yn-Iâl (Denbighshire) hoard, discovered just a few kilometres to the north-west of the Treuddyn find in 1982, comprised two folded gold bracelets, a gold finger-ingot and two gold link fragments carefully placed inside the socket a large faceted bronze axe of Type Gillespie (Green 1983). Similarly, in 2002, a small hoard was found near Rossett (Wrexham) and comprised four cut fragments of Irish gold bracelets carefully placed inside a slender faceted bronze axe of Type Meldreth and associated with a fine tanged bronze knife (Gwilt et al 2005). The repeated association of gold and tin - highly valued Bronze Age metals - with specially selected faceted axes (in all three cases), appears to represent a remarkably consistent and specific regional practice. The account of the discovery of the Llanarmon-yn-Iâl hoard includes the tantalising observation that 'tiny fragments of lead ore (galena)' were also found inside the socket of the axe, but were discarded by the finder at the time of discovery (Green 1983, 384). In the light of the Treuddyn tin discovery, one wonders if the fragments were misidentified and were instead tin, a dense metal with a similar appearance to lead in corroded (white metal) state, although brighter and more silvery than galena or lead in fresh state. The survival of wood in the socket of the axe indicates that the tin fragment was buried next to the axe, rather than being placed within its socket and later disturbed. Whether or not this is true, the association of either lead or tin with gold, and deposited with a bronze faceted axe, suggests that mixed metals, sometimes in raw, unalloyed and unformed state, were valued and deliberately selected as appropriate for burial. Further examples of gold bracelets found carefully cut or folded and placed inside bronze socketed axes are known from Ireland, south Wales and Cornwall giving a shared western British and Irish patterning (Gwilt et al 2005, 42-3) and the north-east Wales cluster is a more specific practice and clustering within this wider pattern. A caveat to this is the observation that the Treuddyn find differs from the other two hoards and the others cited in one respect: here, the tin object was not placed inside the socket of the faceted axe, but beside it, since the survival of wood in the base of the socket occupies too much of the internal cavity to fit the hook-shaped tin object aswell.



The siting of the Treuddyn find, on dry-land at high altitude (295-300m OD) and near the headwaters of the Rivers Terrig and Cegidog, is remarkably similar to the siting of the Llanarmon-yn-Iâl hoard in the upland land-block overlooking the headwaters of the River Terrig and the upper reaches of the River Alyn. These rivers are both tributaries of the River Alyn. The Rossett hoard was found, further east and lower down the River Alyn's course in low-lying land and less than 2km from its confluence with the River Dee (Gwilt et al 2005, 28, Fig. 1). This river associated patterning, adds further plausibility to the suggestion that the Treuddyn faceted axe and hook-shaped tin object are a probable Late Bronze Age association. It lends weight to the suggestion that deliberately selected locations (river sources and confluences), with similar social, cosmological and religious meanings and associations, were chosen for the burial of metalwork hoards in this region and at this specific time during the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC).

1. Flat axe - Type Migdale, probable Variant Biggar (Class 3F) 



Dimensions: surviving length 142.9mm; surviving blade width 58.6mm; surviving butt width21.1mm; maximum thickness 8.2mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 253.9g.



This is a largely complete but severely corroded bronze flat axe with no surviving original surfaces. It has a narrow, tapering and rounded butt and the axe has a slender profile, whose sides are not markedly concave and curved. One side is irregular to slightly concave and the other now appears slightly convex, with little widening and change of angle at the blade end. The blade edge is shallowly curved in plan view. The edges of the sides appear rounded with no surviving evidence of hammered low-flanges. There is no evidence of a median bevel and the blade is lenticular in side-section (i.e. with no marked central thickening or significant angle change in the blade thickness). On one butt end, an alloy imperfection shows as a curvilinear surface ridge, which has been differentially resistant to surface corrosion and erosion. The axe is now very fragile with pitted surfaces and a light green patination.



2. Developed Flat Axe of Type Aylesford (Low-flanged Class 4B axe) 



Dimensions: surviving length 129.3mm; surviving blade width 59.7mm; surviving butt width 26.0mm; maximum thickness (at median bevel) 12.5mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 240.5g.



This is a largely complete Developed flat axe or low-flanged axe of bronze, with damaged blade edges, butt and sides, which are in a very fragile condition. Although the butt is damaged, it is narrow and square ended or slightly arched, tapering at the end in side-view. The butt end is narrow with slightly divergent and straight sides. The angle of divergence becomes more pronounced below the line of the median bevel and down the blade end, though the sides remain straight. This gives a slightly angled side profile to this axe. There is no evident widening or recurving of the sides near the blade edge, although the whole of the blade edge and much of the blade bevel is missing. It is estimated that the original length of the axe was approximately 140-150mm, while the original blade width was probably approximately 65mm. The surviving original surfaces on the sides are slightly rounded, but very unstable, the face edges having been hammered up slightly, to provide low-flanges. The axe is thickest at the median bevel, which is straight. The axe is decorated from butt to blade on both sides with continuous and linear rain pattern decoration, running in parallel with the long axis of the axe. Large areas of original surfaces survive, but are very unstable - having a dark green patination. The damaged blade end, butt and sides have a light green patina.","Discussion (Adam Gwilt, Mark Lodwick and Marion Page)



One of the flat axes (No. 1 above) may be identified as a Type Migdale flat axe. Its narrow butt and slender proportion, suggest that it is most closely paralleled by the narrower variant, known in northern Britain as Variant Biggar (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 46-8). Though it is felt probable that this is a flat axe, which never had hammered low flanges, it is not possible to be absolutely certain, due to the lack of survival of original surfaces. Its narrow butt, slender form and modest blade width, combine to indicate this is a Class 3F axe of the southern British typological scheme (Needham 1985, iii, Table I), which correlate with the northern Variant Biggar flat axes. These narrower variants are thought to represent an advanced or late feature of the Migdale tradition (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 46). A diagnostic metrical feature in favour of its late development within the Migdale series is its low blade width to blade length ratio of 0.41. Needham, in his study of the flat and low-flanged axes of southern Britain (Needham 1983; 2004, 220-2; Illus. 19.3) was able to show a chronological trend, seeing ratios decline from ranges of 0.50-0.60 in the earlier Migdale-Brithdir metalworking tradition (with its typical broad bladed and flaring Type Migdale axes) to 0.40-0.50 in the succeeding Mile Cross metalworking tradition. A ratio of 0.41 for this axe clearly sits within the range for late Migdale or Class 3F axes typical of the Mile Cross tradition of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1983, 147-52).





The second axe (No. 2 above) can be identified as one of the earliest forms of Developed Flat Axes, known as Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 60-1). Typical features are a median bevel, hammered face edges (low-flanges), slightly angled sides, decorated surfaces and a medium blade width, as identified and present on this example. In Needham's typological scheme for southern Britain, this axe is an example of a Class 4B low-flanged axe (Needham 1985, iii, Table I; Rohl & Needham 1998, 89-90). Although it is difficult to calculate, with precision, the blade width to blade length ratio for this axe, due to the differential damage to both blade and butt ends, an estimated range of 0.43-0.46 is consistent with the wider observed trend for flat and low-flanged axes of the Mile Cross metalworking tradition (Needham 2004, 220, Illus. 19.3).



These axes may both be identified as belonging to Metalwork Assemblage IV- the Aylesford or Mile Cross tradition - of the Early Bronze Age (2050-1850BC) (Needham 1985, iii, Table I; Needham 1996; Rohl & Needham 1998, 89-90). The Migdale - Brithdir tradition (Metalwork Assemblage III) in part overlaps with this, ranging from 2200BC to 1950BC. Given the association of a late Type Migdale, Variant Biggar flat-axe with a technologically more developed Type Aylesford low-flanged axe here, a date range of 2050-1900BC, within the period of overlap, may be determined for the burial of these two axes.



Further evidence in support of the burial of the axes together and at the same time may be derived by the association elsewhere of Type Migdale (Class 3E & 3F) with Type Aylesford (Class 4B) axes in hoards (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61; Needham 1983, 294-6). The Mile Cross hoard from Norfolk, giving its name to the Mile Cross metalworking tradition, contained a Class 3F low-flanged axe (equating with Type Migdale, Variants Biggar and Nairn) and a Class 4B low-flanged axe (equating with a Type Aylesford Developed flat-axe) (Needham 1983, 294-6; Cat. Nf 45/1 & 45/2, Figs. 24 & 103; Lawson & Needham 1985). Additional Class 3E & 3F axe associations with Class 4B axes are found in the Place Newton, and Sherburn Carr hoards, both in East Yorkshire (Brewster 1952-5, 450-2 & Fig. 3; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 46 & 61, Cats 209B, 316A & C, 317A, Pls. 17, 26 & 27; Needham 1983, 294-6, Fig. 101). In Wales, a relevant hoard association is the Newport, (Newport) hoard comprising two Developed flat-axes of Type Aylesford, identified by Needham as one Class 3F low-flanged axe and one Class 4B low-flanged axe (Britton 1963, 312, Appendix A, II.7; Needham 1979, 285-6, Fig. 12.1; 1983, 294-6, Fig. 101; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61; Gwilt 1999, 4; Northover unpublished, H. 122). These belong to the Mile Cross - Aylesford metalworking tradition dating to 2050-1850BC (Needham 1985, iii, Table I; Needham 1996).



Also from Wales is the Brithdir (Pont Caradoc), Caerphilly hoard, which contained three Type Migdale axes (Class 3E) and one Type Aylesford (Class 4A) axe (Britton 1963, 312, Appendix A. No. II.6; Needham 1979, 283, Fig. 10; Gwilt 1999; Northover unpublished, H. 70). The Brithdir hoard has been interpreted as typifying the Migdale metalworking tradition in southern Britain. The single wide-bladed axe with a median bevel (Class 4A) in this hoard (classified as a Developed flat-axe of Type Aylesford by other researchers), has been argued as earlier than true low-flanged axes with narrower blades (Class 4B) of the later Mile Cross tradition (Needham 2004, 222). Yet the three Type Migdale axes in this hoard have narrow butts and markedly flared and wide-bladed forms and these characteristics have been argued a more typical of the near-Migdale axes, which developed from the classic Migdale axes of northern Britain (Needham 2004, 220-1). Both this feature and the single axe with a median bevel, suggest that the Brithdir hoard typifies the late Migdale to early Mile Cross transition (Needham 1983, 290), dating to 2050-1950BC, rather than the classic Migdale tradition of northern Britain spanning from as early as 2200BC to 1950BC. It is possible that chronological changes in blade and butt widths observed on flat axes and the appearance of median bevels and low-flanges were piecemeal, with slightly different trajectories of change in different regions and hoard associations across Britain. Therefore, the Brithdir hoard may be seen as an appropriate broadly contemporary and transitional parallel to the Nevern hoard, containing late Migdale axes and an early Developed flat-axe in association.



Finally from Wales, mention should also be made the Oxwich hoard, discovered by a metal-detectorist in 1999, comprises three fragmentary bronze flat axes (Gwilt & Macdonald 1999; Northover unpublished report). One axe with a wide flaring blade and narrow butt is a development from Irish Killaha axes and Migdale axes, finding parallel with Type Migdale, Variant Nairn axes and equating to a Class 3B flat axe (Harbison 1969, 24-32, Cat. 580; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 48-9, Cat. 246; Needham 1985b; Rohl & Needham 1998, 88-9; Northover unpublished report). A second small side fragment is less diagnostic, but was once probably part of a similar axe (Northover unpublished report). The third fragment is a narrow and decorated butt: each side has a marked longitudinal ridge with faces decorated with three parallel bands of overlapping hammered dashes arranged vertically. Insufficient of this axe survives to confidently identify it to precise type. However, the earliest known decorated flat-axes belong to the Migdale-Brithdir metalworking tradition with decoration continuing and becoming increasingly frequent features of Developed and low-flanged axes, during the succeeding Mile Cross and Willerby metalworking traditions spanning 2050-1700BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 44-5, 59; Northover unpublished report). While the decoration on this axe butt has been paralleled with that observed on certain Irish Developed flat-axes of slightly later date (Harbison 1969, 32-55, Cats. 866, 914 & 915; Northover unpublished report), the metallurgical composition of this axe, with B1 impurity patterns, is consistent with those in the Brithdir and Newport hoards. Therefore, the Oxwich hoard was probably buried at a similar time as the Nevern hoard, between 2050-1900BC and during the late Migdale-Brithdir to Mile Cross-Aylesford metalworking traditions.



In a British and Irish context, some further contemporary metalwork associations may be cited. The Highlow and St Bertram's Well hoards, both from Derbyshire, each contained associations of Class 3F axes (Needham 1983, 152 & 195, Cats. Dy 8/1, Dy 8/2, Sd2 and UP30, Figs. 23, 24 & 103). The Read, Lancashire hoard has one surviving Class 3F axe found in association with a number of other flat axes, now lost (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61, Cat. 317 & Pl. 27; Needham 1983, 152), while the Castle Rising, Norfolk hoard contained an association of a Class 3E/F axe with a Class 3E axe (Needham 1983, 252-3, Figs. 23, 87 & 102; Needham & Lawson 1985; Rohl & Needham 1998, 201 In Ireland, the Ballyvalley, Co. Down and Glenwhirry, Co. Antrim hoards each contained a Class 3F axe in association with a Class 3E axe (Harbison 1969, 37 & 45, Cats. 943-4, 1252-3, Pls. 42 & 55; Needham 1983, 152). The Caerlaverock, Dumfries hoard comprised a Class 3F axe in association with a Class 3G axe (Yates 1979; Needham 1983, 152 & 295). The St Erth, Cornwall hoard contained two Class 4B (Aylesford) axes in association (Needham 1983, 295, CW 9/1 & 9/2, Figs. 32, 33 & 102). A number of graves have contained important metalwork associations: the Moot Low Barrow, Derbyshire contained a Class 3F axe and a lower jaw of pig, associated with a crouched inhumation (Needham 1983, 295, Dy 12/1, Fig. 25). The Parwich Moor 1, Derbyshire inhumation burial contained a Class 4B axe associated with a Type Merthyr Mawr, Variant Parwich bronze dagger, a jet disc bead and a 'circular' flint (Gerloff 1975, 50-1, Cat. 54 & Pl.5; Needham 1983, 295, Dy 13/1-13/4, Figs. 30 & 104) and the Aylesford inhumation burial contained a Class 4B axe associated with two riveted daggers, one of Type Masterton and the other of Group Aylesford (Gerloff 1975, 61 & 68, Cats. 86 & 103, Pls. 8 &10; Needham 1983, 295, Kt 2/1-2/3, Figs. 29 & 102). These latter two burials help to cross-correlate the axe series with contemporary daggers and developments in the Early Bronze Age burial record, although precise dating of these daggers has nevertheless proved problematic (Needham 1983, 169-71).



Nine single finds of Type Migdale bronze flat-axes are known from west Wales. These include examples from Whitechurch, Llanfyrnach, Llanfyrnach Common and Whitesands Bay in Pembrokeshire (Griffiths 1893; Nash Williams 1927; 1929; Fox & Bowen 1935, 52 & Fig. 26.1; Evans 1937; Savory 1980, 100-101, Cats. 107, 114; Northover unpublished, Cat. Nos. 44-47), Llandybїe, Cenarth and Llanddarog in Carmarthenshire (Savory 1962; 1963a; 1980, 101, Cat. 112; Northover unpublished, Cat. Nos. 24-26) and Cefn Coch, Glandyfi in Ceredigion (Sansbury 1930; Briggs 1994, 215, Appendix V, No. 7, Fig. 29.1; Northover unpublished, Cat. 23) with another example said to have been found in west Wales, probably Pembrokeshire (Wheeler 1922, 188; Northover unpublished, Cat. 53). To these may be added a single bronze Type Killaha flat-axe from St. Edren's, Mathry, Pembrokeshire (Northover unpublished, Cat. 20), while single Developed flat-axes of Type Scrabo Hill and Type Glenalla are known from Llanglydwen in Carmarthenshire and Rhyd y Torth, Ceredigion respectively (Sansbury 1930; Savory 1951; 1980, 101, Cat. 115, Fig. 17; Briggs 1994, 216, Appendix V, No. 21, Fig. 29.5 & 29.6; Northover unpublished, Cats. 64 & 69). The apparent relative frequency of Type Migdale axes here in comparison with a relative sparcity of Developed flat-axes, is an interesting and distinctive emerging regional pattern (Williams & Lodwick forthcoming, 11). Across north Wales and south east Wales, later Developed flat-axes are far more frequent occurrences, both numerically and proportionately in comparison with Migdale flat axes (Williams & Lodwick forthcoming, Map 4).



Within this broader regional pattern, there seems also to be a significant local clustering in the distribution of early bronze axes in north western Carmarthenshire and north eastern Pembrokeshire, as indicated by the Whitechurch, Llanfyrnach and Llanfyrnach Common, Llanglydwen single axes, and now the Nevern hoard. Most of these axes date from 2100-1900BC, with the single exception of the Llanglydwen example, which dates from 1900-1700BC. These appear to circle the eastern and northern margins of Mynydd Preseli (Savory 1962, 75; Gwilt 1999, Fig. 2; Williams & Lodwick forthcoming 11-12) and in a land block of approximately 10km (north to south) by 13km (east to west). This was a sacred and symbolic landscape in the Neolithic and Bronze Age, with many tombs and ritual monuments known (e.g. Kirk & Williams 2000; Darvill et al 2003; 2005; 2006; Darvill & Wainwright 2002a; 2002b; 2003), while its outcropping bluestones (dolerites, rhyolites and tuffs) were transported and incorporated into the great ritual monument at Stonehenge in Wiltshire between 2550-1600BC (e.g. Cleal 1995; Montague 1995, 375-6; Darvill 2006, 136-41; Darvill & Wainwright 2009; Burrow 2011, 48-52; Ixer & Bevins 2011; Bevins et al 2011). In addition, Neolithic stone axes and Early Bronze Age axe-hammers and battle axes were created using a variety of outcropping rocks from northern and western Pembrokeshire, being transported and exchanged over long distances across southern Britain (e.g. Shotton1972; Cummins 1979; Roe 1966; 1979; Savory 1980, 36-8; Clough 1988; Houlder 1988; Burrow 2003, 63-5 & Fig. 28). It seems possible that the access to, use and deposition of early bronze axes in this regional locality is interlinked within this broader symbolic and exchange context.



The archaeological findspot investigation, undertaken with the assistance of the finders, enabled the details of the reported depths and an account of the relative positioning of the two axes to be clarified: the axes were buried at approximately 0.28m depth and approximately 2.7m apart, buried flat and with their blade ends both facing west. Unfortunately the detector pits marking the precise findspots of each axe could not be re-identified and therefore no further information about the precise burial contexts could be retrieved. However, the hand excavation of a test pit in the immediate vicinity of the finds, allowed the character of the soils and local weathered bedrock to be revealed. Given the close association and contemporary date of the two axes, it seems probable that they were originally buried together as a hoard. It is possible that they were buried a short distance apart in a large archaeological feature, such as a pit, scoop or ditch. However, equally likely is that the axes became slightly dispersed after burial, although their depth suggests this occurred in antiquity, rather than in the post-Medieval period due to agricultural activity. The local geology comprises three main elements: parallel linear outcrops of low grade metamorphosed mudstones of the Aber Mawr Formation (AbM), next to overlying tuffs of the Fishguard Volcanic Group (FV), with intruded dolerite outcrops (Richard Bevins pers. comm.). The angular laminating rock fragments identified in the soil layers may therefore be identified as weathered mudstone, while the large boulder and the sub-rounded igneous stones are intrusive dolerite. Locally, the frequently occurring surface boulders occurring in this landscape setting are also doleritic, having been re-worked locally by ice, frost action and glacial melt-water stream action. The hoard find is situated within a local landscape context which is rich in known prehistoric monuments, sites and finds (Page pers. comm.). The placing of the hoard at a watery origin, with views out over lower lying land and looking toward the sea, may have held particular social and symbolic associations to Early Bronze Age communities (e.g. Darvill et al 2004), making it an appropriate place for burying valued metal artefacts.

It is likely that this tool is from the Wilberton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking, phases which correspond to Needham's (1996) Period's 6 - 8.","Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC.

""It is interesting to learn of yet another of these arrowheads from British soil. Many years ago I would have ]...[ suspected a collector's loss. However, there are now sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard, Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have to be Early Bronze Age. Bronze barbed-and-tanged arrowheads in one guise or another continue right through and my suspicion would be that most finds are Middle to Late BA. The Penard example proved to have an unusual metal composition suggestive of it being a foreigner.""

Cast axe with a crescentic cutting edge, a plain and gently tapering body lacking any external ridging, a semi-circular loop whose inner end coincides with a low moulding for a round collared mouth of external diameter 32mm; within the socket the mouth achieves a sub-rectangular shape. A ridge of length c.30mm appears within the socket on either side, and was perhaps intended to enhance the grip of the axehead on its haft. A mould line appears all around the external median line of the axehead, centred on the upper and lower sides. The cutting edge remains sharp. The plain exterior and the size recalls that of socketed axes from Caythorpe 1 held in Lincoln Museum (Davey, P. 1970, Later Bronze Age Metalwork from Lincolnshire [volume 1], B. Phil.

574612,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,A large fragment of a Middle Bronze Age rapier blade in very fine condition. The blade was recovered from a riverine deposit. Peter Reavill comments: the classic tell-tale features are the thickened forte (the section by the hilt) that tapers into a very thick sturdy mid-rib - which extends to the point which is almost lozengiform in section. The blades are thought to be for stabbing rather than slashing. The cutting edges are present - but feathered. This blade is snapped below the diagnostic part which is the hilt plate (often trapezoidal) with 2 - 4 rivet holes. The junction between the hilt and upper blade is also lost. I think I would be happiest with attributing it to Burgess / Gerloff's Group III http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/109896- as it seems to have a 'triple arras' - central rib flanked by lesser rib near the cutting edge - possibly Group IV http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/57067 as the outer rib is more rounded and less distinct. Both of these date to the period 1400-1250BC - Needham's period 5.

576641,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete copper alloy (bronze) socketed axehead fragment, of Late Bronze Age dating (c. 950 BC to c. 750 BC)


Less than 50% of the axehead is present, consisting only of part of the body, blade and the remnants of the socket. It is missing the top part of the axehead and the loop.


It is sub rectangular in plan, with an expanded / flared convex, but abraded cutting edge. The socket is sub rectangular in section. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to the base of socket is 10.23 mm. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. No casting seams are visible. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is incomplete. The sides do not appear to be faceted and no ribs are present on either the front or back of the axehead fragment.


The axehead fragment measures 34.34 mm in length, 24.90 mm wide (at the blade edge), 18.69 mm wide (across the remnants of the socket), 7.02 mm thick (at the socket) and 1.39 mm thick (blade). The walls of the axehead are 2.1 mm thick. It weighs 15.2 g.


The axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface.


This socketed axehead fragment is on the small side for the majority of socketed axehead types, but the shape and style is too well made for any of the miniature axehead types that are found in the Wiltshire area (Robinson, 1995). It is more likely to be Late Bronze Age in dating than Late Iron Age to Early Roman. Due to the axe fragment having a slender look to it, it could be similar to the Medreth type axes, possibly a SE type or Medreth, consistent with a Ewart Park assemblage type, of Late Bronze Age dating (Needham Period 7).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,15.2,,,7.02,34.34,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Alrewas,,,,,WMID-6FEAE1,,WMID-6FEAE1.jpg,Late Bronze Age: Incomplete Socketed Axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-6FEAE1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/439585.jpg

578179,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-750,"A fragment of copper alloy which appears to be an incomplete section of a blade. It is possible that this fragment is a small part of a blade of Bronze Age date (c.2350-801BC). Weight is 14.3g, incomplete length is 29.65mm, width is 25.31mm and thickness is 4.76mm. The cross section was probably originally a flattish oval with the edges tapering out very thin, now mostly missing. The upper and lower surfaces do not seem to have had a higher point/ridged longitudinal centre despite the presence of corrosion product and some patches where the original surface seems to be missing.



Mr Peter Reavill agrees that one section is suggestive of a blade and that a likely date range would be Middle to Late Bronze Age (c.1500-750BC). The blade is likely to be a knife although a fragment of sickle is another consideration, however not enough of the blade survives to be sure. The absence of a prominent mid-rib is not unusual as most slight blades do not have these See PAS record HESH-199F11. Dating Bronze Age knives is difficult and almost impossible with so little surviving as with this example hence the broad date range above. The presence of another Bronze Age artefact fragment (PAS record number ESS-8FB2C3), found by the same finder, within 1km of this artefact's find spot and the context of the find spot helps support the Bronze Age date that has been given to this fragment.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-12-26T00:00:00Z,,,,14.3,,,4.76,29.65,1,Helen Fowler,Helen Fowler,Eastern,Cambridgeshire,Fenland,Whittlesey,TL3298,From finder,52.56382561,-0.05405059,CAM-583B44,,CAM-583B44.jpg,Unknown date : Incomplete Copper Alloy Blade,Cambridgeshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/hfowler/CAM-583B44.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/440743.jpg
578359,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).


The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.89 MM (thickness: 1.49 MM). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The long edges bear slight evidence that they have been raised to form flanges. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.73 MM). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.41 MM. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. Minor traces of oblique slash marks has been noted on the flanged edges, under a microscope magnification. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.


The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.


It measures 84.19 MM in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.41 MM, width at the butt is 12.89 MM and it has a maximum thickness of 9.73 MM. It weighs 70.2 grams.


The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). 


These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

578366,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1140,-1020,"A Late Bronze Age sword of the Wilburton type (Burgess and Colquhoun, 1988, 40), dating between 1140-1020 BC (Needham et al. 1997). This sword is a flange-hilted sword, the blade and hilt being cast as one with flanges running along the edges of the hilt. The terminus is fan shaped and about half the width of the shoulder. There is a small, uneven, deposit of lead at the terminus end which may have been to aid balance. There is a slight bulge in the hilt, towards the shoulder, and a rounded slot in the centre of the hilt (33.95 mm long by 6.20 mm wide).The shoulder curves outwards to its widest with a ricasso notch below where the blade joins the hilt, resulting in a barbed effect on the shoulder. One of the notches is heavily worn making it almost invisible. There are two oval rivet holes on either side of the shoulder (10.52 mm and 7.80 mm in diameter). The bevelled blade is leaf shaped, being particularly lenticular towards the tip.



There is considerable green-blue oxidation product on one side of the blade, the side which was facing down when discovered. Amongst this oxidisation are 3-4 patches of reddish-brown oxidisation. The other side has some green-blue product but also a light brown patination across much of the surface. One would assume that the most heavily oxidised side had been in contact with water for a long period of time, therefore being found facing downwards may suggest it had been flipped whilst in the river. There are ""nicks"" along the blade edge probably caused by a similar weapon, which may be evidence of use either in battle or practice.



This type of sword has primarily been found in the Thames Valley area or the Fens (Jon Cotton, pers. comm.). Examples of fragments can be found on the PAS database: NMGW-7D0AC5, HAMP-352B13 and LVPL759

Description



Sword



1. (SF 23) An incomplete and highly fragmentary copper-alloy antennae sword pommel (cf. PAS find: SUSS-761CD0; see also Von Quillfeldt 1995: Taf. 75, no. 219 'Schwert mit gegossenem Spiralknauf' for a comparable example with integral, probably cast complete loops). The sword pommel survives in multiple fragments, with additional fragments of the grip also retained; the lower portions of the sword hilt that would adjoin the blade appear to be absent. The pommel form is sub-lentoid in plan, with slight losses at both narrowed ends; it is flat in profile. Extending upwards from the narrowed ends of this flat, sub-lentoid form are two antennae loops; these now survive in multiple fragments. Both of the loops complete a full circle, measuring c. 1.7mm in diameter across each loop, with both ends of each loop extending from the flattened sub-lentoid upper surface; this suggests that they were probably cast in the complete looped form, rather than hammered. The fragments which form the loops are broadly flat in section and very thin. From the narrowed ends of the flattened sub-lentoid surface the pommel body extends down to a narrowed sub-oval in plan grip. This grip is incomplete and fragmentary, with its highly fragmentary nature preventing an identification of its complete form or type. Visible within the aperture of this now damaged grip is a layer of a dark grey substance (c. 3mm thick), possibly of organic material, that might have been used as a fixative for the tang of the sword blade; also visible is a small circular perforation that extends through the flattened upper surface of the pommel (c. 6.4mm in diameter) that would have accommodated the tanged end of the sword blade. The antennae sword pommel and grip are in poor condition outside of their fragmentary state, with much of the body suffering from moderate corrosion resulting in a green-grey patina, with an area of blue corrosion on one side of the grip. N.B. Photographs of the pommel in-situ (taken by Yorkshire Archaeological Trust) show that it was attached to a larger (now fragmentary) portion of the sword grip.



Dimensions: Pommel dimensions: 59.4mm by 23.5mm; Hilt length: 23.1mm; Hilt aperture dimensions: 23.9mm by 15.4mm; Weight: 30.44g (Main fragment: 21.01g; left spiral fragments: 2.78g; right spiral fragments: 2.01g; additional fragments 4.64g) N.B the many other probable fragments of the sword hilt (non-joining) have not been included in the weight.



Spearheads



2. (SF 22) A copper-alloy spear of uncertain type in multiple fragments. The spear fragments form the upper portion of the spear, including the spear tip; the most substantial fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan, though all original edges that would show the extent of the blades are now missing. The socket is missing. The spear fragment has a circular to oval mid-rib, and the blade surface appears to be flat, although only some of the original surface remains. The remainder of the large spear fragment is in poor condition, and is light green in colour with white, sand like deposits in the corrosion product.



Dimensions: Length: 77.64mm; Width: (at middle) 19.7mm, (at tip) 7.9mm; Diameter of mid-rib; 8.75mm; Blade thickness (at widest point): 3.95mm; Weight (large fragment and moderate blade fragments): 23.21g. NB smaller undiagnostic fragments were not weighed.



3. (SF 4) A fragment of copper-alloy spear of uncertain type. The spear fragment is formed of the upper portion of the spear, though the tip has broken away and is now absent; the fragment is subsequently trapezoidal in plan. The mid-rib of the spear fragment is sub-circular, with a flat blade surface and a bevelled edge. The fragment is dark green in colour and in a good condition, with a slight hairline crack on one side at the bevelled edge. A series of small, worn depressions are also visible along the mid-rib; it is unclear whether these were a result of manufacture or use.



Dimensions: Length: 31.6mm; Width: (at widest) 32.1 mm, (at smallest) 25.7mm; Weight 9.73g.



Socketed axes: Yorkshire Type



4. (SF 13) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1502 (pl. 96), 1472 (pl. 94), 1419 (pl. 92) and 1398 (pl. 91), though SF 13 has longer vertical ribs). The socket mouth is rectangular in plan with an everted collar, and with a horizontal moulding below. A small circular indentation resulting from a casting error can be seen in the collar (diameter 3.3mm). From the moulding, three vertical diverging decorative ribs extend on both faces of the axe; the partial loss of one face has removed some of this detail. The side loop, also springing from the moulding, is complete with a 'D' shaped aperture. Below the moulding the body of the axe tapers slightly outwards to a fragmentary and chipped wedge-shaped cutting edge. The axe has a mid green colour overall, with areas of lighter green where the original surface has been lost.



Dimensions: Length: 78.5mm; Socket width: 38.9mm by 37.5mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 4.75mm-6.9mm; Blade width: 42.3mm; Loop: 17mm by 9.7mm, internal dimensions: 10.2mm by 4.3mm; Weight: 153g.



5. (SF 16) A near complete cast copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1403 (pl. 91), 1471-3 (pl. 94), though SF 16 has longer ribs). The socket mouth is square in plan with an everted collar of uneven thickness, and a horizontal moulding below. From this moulding three slightly divergent decorative ribs extend, with the two exterior ribs sitting at the transition between the face and the face edge. The axe retains a side loop with a 'D' shaped aperture; however extensive active corrosion has partially blocked this aperture. A small portion of the blade tip is missing, with the original cutting edge still present. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. This axe has a light to mid green patina beneath extensive soil coverage.



Dimensions: Length: 79.8mm; Socket width: 38.4mm by 37.4mm; Wall thickness: 5.4mm-5.7mm (4.55mm at loop side); Side loop length: 20mm; loop width: 11.2mm. Blade width: 44.5mm; Weight 177g.



6. (SF 2) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type in three fragments (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1419 (pl. 92) and 1512 (pl. 96). The body of the axe is largely complete with slight losses to the socket mouth; two additional small fragments complete this. The axe has an everted collar, now fragmentary and uneven, with a horizontal moulding below. Three decorative ribs extend from this moulding; these are parallel, with the two exterior ribs positioned inwards away from the side-face of the axe. On one side of the axe a complete loop springs from the moulding. The lower portion of the axe consists of an expanded, slightly flared blade; this is broadly complete with a slight hemispherical in plan loss in the centre of the cutting edge of the blade. Additional losses to the original surface on one face and one side of the axe are visible, with an emphasis at the blade portion of the axe; these exhibit a light green colour, whilst the remainder of the axe body has a mid-to dark green patina and fair condition. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade.



Dimensions: Length: 81.9mm; Socket dimensions: 37.1mm by 36.8mm; Loop dimensions: 17.7mm by 6.2mm, internal loop dimensions: 10.3mm by 5.1mm; Weight: 143.59g (No soil)



7. (SF 3) A copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1503 (pl. 96), 1526 (pl. 97), 1536 (pl. 98). The axe is incomplete in that it is missing the uppermost everted collar at the square in plan socket mouth. The horizontal moulding remains, and from this three parallel decorative ribs extend on both faces of the axe. A complete side loop also springs from the moulding; this appears to have been miscast due to its uneven dimensions and finish. The body of the axe continues to a complete wedge-shaped cutting edge; there is one slight loss to the original surface on one face. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. The axe is of a very fine condition and displays a mid-green shiny patina.



Dimensions: Length: 84.2mm; Socket width: 33.2mm by 33mm; Side loop dimensions: length 20.2mm, width 9.7mm, internal diameter 11.4mm by 6.2mm; Blade width: 43.5mm; Weight: 154g (No soil).



8. (SF 10 and SF 8) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1361 and 1367 (pl. 89) in two fragments; one socket mouth and body fragment (SF 10), and a lower body and blade fragment (SF 8). The first fragment is formed of a square in plan socket with an everted collar, below which a horizontal moulding is visible; a complete but uneven side loop springs from this moulding. On both faces of the upper axe fragment are three decorative ribs; these slightly diverge, with the two exterior ribs on both faces positioned at the exterior edge of the axe body. Casting seams are retained on both sides of this axe fragment, and across the side loop. The secondary fragment is rectangular at the socket and flares slightly to a near complete blade cutting edge; it is slightly rounded with just one slight chip at the side to face transition.



There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade.



In the centre of both fragments at the point at which they join is a pressure point resulting from external force; this pressure has resulted in the axe separating into the two fragments. The wall thickness at this point on both fragments is distinctly irregular, with the face that has suffered the compression significantly thinner than the opposite face of the axe; this may be indicative of the axe being heated prior to being forcefully split into two.



Both fragments are a mid-green grey in colour, although the face which has suffered compression has areas of light green corrosion suggestive of its close proximity to another corroded item in the ground.



Dimensions: Length: 90.3mm; Socket width: 38.7 by 39.3mm; Socket wall thickness: 6.1mm-7mm; Side loop dimensions: length 18mm, width 9.6mm, loop diameter 9.2mm by 5.4mm; Blade width 48.9mm ; Weight 190g (lower blade fragment has no soil).



9. (SF 18 and SF 8 associated) A small copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type in two fragments; one small fragment comprises part of the socket mouth and side face (SF 8 associated), whilst the larger fragment spans the whole length of the object, with a narrow portion of the socket mouth preserved through to the blade tip (SF 18). The socket mouth is rectangular in plan with both fragments preserving part of the everted collar and the horizontal moulding. A side loop (part of which is retained on each fragment) springs from this moulding, along with three divergent ribs on each face. Casting seams are retained on either side of the axe. The blade is slightly flared and the cutting egde of the blade is complete, with moderate soil covering the surface of the axe; it has a mid-green patina beneath this.



Dimensions: Length: 64mm; Socket wall thickness: 5.15mm; Blade width: 38.2mm. Weight: 58.08g (large fragment 53.35g, small fragment: 4.74g).



10. (SF 17) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type. The fragment is 'L' shaped in plan, comprising a portion of one face and one side; the completed socket is likely to have been rectangular to square in section. The fragment retains a pronounced everted collar at the socket mouth with a horizontal moulding below; one single vertical cast decorative rib is visible on the face. Traces of a casting seam are also visible on the side. This fragment has a light green colour overall and moderate corrosion product.



Dimensions: Length: 39.5mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 5.8mm-8.5mm; Width 24.8mm; Weight 27.4g.



11. (SF 19) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain, but possible Yorkshire type. The fragment is formed of the upper portion of the axe at the socket mouth, with the lower blade portion now absent. It has a rectangular in plan socket with an everted collar, with a horizontal moulding beneath this. Casting seams are visible on either side of the axe and a complete side loop is also retained. One face of the axe has suffered considerable pressure to its exterior surface, resulting in a moderate depression where the axe wall has been forced inwards. The axe has a mid-green colour overall with moderate soil covering.



Dimensions: Length: 33.6mm; Socket width: 44.5mm by 35.9mm; Loop dimensions: 20.2mm by 8.9mm, internal loop dimensions: 11.2mm by 6.7mm; Weight: 47g.



Everthorpe type



12. (SF 7) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Everthorpe type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess, 1317 and 1320 (pl. 87). The socket mouth is square in plan, with an unevenly cast everted collar; below this a horizontal moulding is visible from which a complete side loop springs. From this moulding the body of the axe continues in a straight form, before flaring slightly to the blade; the cutting edge of the blade is complete aside from a few small removals resulting from corrosion. The body of the axe is plain with casting seams retained on both sides and across the side loop. It has a mid to dark green grey colour and is in good condition overall, with a slight soil covering.



Dimensions: Length: 92.9mm; Socket dimensions: 36.7mm by 35.8mm; Wall thickness: c. 5.7mm-6mm; Loop dimensions: length 18.9mm; width 9.7mm; Blade width: 45.7mm; Weight: 182g.



13. (SF 5) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Everthorpe type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess: 1320 (pl. 87). The axe is sub-circular (square with rounded corners) in plan at the mouth, with an everted collar and horizontal moulding below. From this a complete side loop springs. The body of the axe is narrowed before flaring slightly to the blade tip; the cutting edge of the blade is uneven and incomplete. One casting seam is retained, the other is visible where the original surface of the axe remains. The surface of the axe is uneven and much of the original surface has been lost through corrosion, resulting in a light green colour overall. Additional corrosion product is visible inside the socket within the retained soil; it is not certain whether this is the remains of a secondary object or if the corrosion material relates to SF 5.



Dimensions: Length: 85.3mm; Socket dimensions: 36.2mm by 33.4mm; Wall thickness: 4.8mm; Loop dimensions: length 18.4mm, width 8.4, internal aperture 11.3mm by 6mm; Weight: 145g.



14. (SF 14) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type. The socket mouth is square in plan (with rounded corners) with an everted collar; below this is a horizontal moulding. A moderate sub-triangular in plan removal can be seen at the socket (resulting from the extensive corrosion of the metal); this has also lead to further cracking down the face. The body of the socketed axe is plain and is fairly straight, though it flares out moderately to the cutting edge of the blade; this is nearly complete with a few slight losses. A single casting seam retained on either side; a pronounced seam is also visible at the loop. The side loop is complete with a 'D' shaped aperture, currently filled with soil. The axe retains further soil inside the socket, with additional soil on all external surfaces. It has a dark green patina beneath this soil covering.



Dimensions: Length: 91.6mm; Socket width: 36.2mm; Socket wall thickness: 5.3mm; Loop dimensions: length 19mm, width 10.5mm; Weight: 169g.



15. (SF 9) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type (cf Schmidt and Burgess 1307 (pl. 86). The socket is sub-rectangular in plan with an unevenly cast everted collar; a moderate section of this collar is missing on one face of the axe. A worn horizontal moulding is also visible beneath this collar, from which a complete side loop springs; this side loop is uneven from casting. The body of the axe is broadly straight beneath the moulding, expanding in width slightly towards the lower portion of the axe, before flaring substantially to the blade. The cutting edge of the blade is incomplete with losses at both the tip and on both side faces. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. The body of the axe retains cast seams on both sides and across the side loop. It has a mid green colour and slightly mottled surface, with a number of small hairline cracks visible on both faces; these have resulted in small areas of loss of the original surface at the blade tip and on one side face.



The axe has been poorly cast, with a number of small apertures appearing as a result. These are visible beneath the socket collar, on the side face near the side loop and two further indentations can be seen on one face of the body. The diameters range from c.2.2mm-2.9mm.



Dimensions: Length: 91.5mm; Socket dimension: 37.4mm by 37.9mm (with fragment missing); Wall thickness: c. 3.8mm-6.3mm; Blade width: 48mm; Loop dimensions: length 19mm; width 10mm; internal diameter: 9.4 by 5.8mm; Weight: 133g (no soil).



16. (SF 1) An incomplete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type (cf Schmidt and Burgess 1308 (pl.86). The socket is sub-rectangular in plan with a pronounced everted collar, below which a horizontal moulding is visible. From the moulding an incomplete side loop springs; the lower portion of the loop is now missing. The axe has broadly straight slides and a slight flare at the blade; the blade tip is incomplete, with a moderate loss to one side. The body of the axe retains cast seams on both sides, but is otherwise plain. The original surface of the axe has been partially lost through extensive corrosion, such that the axe now appears a light green colour with a mottled and unevenly textured surface.



Within the socket of this axe is a fragment of a secondary item, probably a socketed axe socket, still retained within moderate soil. This fragment has an everted collar and might have once been rounded in plan at the socket.



Dimensions: Length 82.9mm, length including internal fragment: 90.3mm; Socket dimensions: 38mm by 36.4mm; Loop dimensions: length 9.1mm, width 7.7mm; Weight: 195g.



Meldreth variant Aylsham type



17. (SF 15) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Meldreth, variant Aylsham type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1233 (pl. 83). The socket mouth is circular to square in plan, with an everted collar, and a horizontal moulding at the transition from the socket to the body of the axe. The body of the axe is narrowed and faceted (8 very slight facets), and expands to a flared blade. The blade is now damaged so that the original cutting edge of the blade is missing; further triangular in plan losses are also visible to either side of the blade. This axe retains two prominent casting seams, one down each side, with a complete, though slightly off-cast side loop. It has a mid-green patina beneath the soil covering.



Dimensions: Length 89.6mm ; Socket dimensions: 32.5mm by 30.2mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 3.9mm-5.8mm; Loop dimensions: length 19.5mm; width 6.9mm, internal diameter 10.2mm by 4.7mm; Blade width: 43.7mm; Weight: 90g.



Alford type



18. (SF 11) An incomplete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable type Alford (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 188-89), although with some comparisons among type Dowris (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 198-9; cf. Eogan's Group 11 (2000, 86-7), although the slightly moulded collar suggests it is more likely to belong to the former. The socket mouth is sub-circular in plan; a complete loop springs from the collar on one side. Within the socket mouth two internal haft seams are visible, with one projecting from each interior face. The body of the axe extends with straight sides for a short length, before flaring significantly to the blade; the blade is now incomplete with much of the original extent missing. Casting seams are visible down both exterior side faces. The axe has a slightly moulded rim. The axe has a mid-green colour overall with moderate corrosion product on the exterior surfaces.



Dimensions: Length: 52.6mm; Socket dimensions: 29.9mm by 27.2mm; Loop dimensions: width 6.7mm, length: 15.3mm, internal aperture: 6.95mm by 3.4mm; Weight: 52.61g.



Unknown type



19. (SF 20) A copper-alloy socketed axe fragment of uncertain type, which has been reheated and compressed prior to deposition. This fragment is sub-lozengical in plan, and has a 'figure of 8' section resulting from the application of pressure which has forced the centre of each face inward. The fragment is irregular at both vertical ends (where the socket mouth and blade would have been) with one end of the fragment displaying an 'L' shaped removal. Visible at this removal is a fragment of a secondary copper-alloy object now situated within the first fragment; this secondary fragment has an everted collar and slight curvature to its profile, and is probably a fragment of a socketed tool or axe. The original form of the exterior axe is unclear due to its reworking, though a small aperture resulting from the initial casting of the object is visible to one side. The fragment has a dark green-grey colour overall with areas of blue corrosion product now visible on its surface.



Dimensions: Length (at longest point): 45.6mm; Width: 38.6mm-38.9mm; Thickness (of compressed mass): 12.9mm; Thickness (of walls): 3-3.4mm; Weight: 77.19g.



20. (SF 6) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain type, comprising the lower portion of the axe blade and blade tip. The fragment has a rectangular in plan socket and wedge-shaped cutting edge; this is incomplete and appears heavily rounded and worn at one side. It has a mid-green colour overall and fair patina, although some portions of the original surface at the upper edge have been lost as a result of corrosion.



Dimensions: Length: 46.1mm; Socket: 29.2mm by 16.2mm; Wall thickness: 1.9mm; Weight: 57g (no soil).



21. (SF 12) Two fragments of a small copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain type; one small socket mouth fragment and a larger blade portion. The axe has a rectangular in plan socket with an everted collar, (visible on the small fragment) with a horizontal moulding below, (visible on the uppermost portion of the lower fragment, at the join to the small mouth fragment). An incomplete side loop is also retained, with a casting seam visible down the opposing side. The cutting edge is wedge-shaped and incomplete, with a slight loss to the original surface. Both fragments have a light green patina overall with several notable hairline cracks on the surface, and the socket contains moderate soil.



Dimensions: Length: 63.2mm; blade width: 32.2mm; Weight: 49.04g



22. (SF 21) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of unknown type. The fragment forms the partial remains of one side or face of the axe, with slight curvature towards one edge representing the original corner of the socketed form. The fragment retains a moderate uneven collar and has a dark green colour overall.



Dimensions: Length: 32.8mm; Width: 37.9mm; Weight: 22.96g.



Associated but non-joining fragments



23 - 28. (SF 1 associated) A further six fragments were reported with SF 1 which do not appear to fit with this particular item but which are undoubtedly from the assemblage as a whole. 4 of the fragments appear to have come from the collar of one (or more) socketed axes, whilst the two other 2 fragments of thin walled, curved copper-alloy, might possibly belong with the sword hilt.



1) Expanded collar with cast seam. Dimensions: 15.8mm by 16.6mm; Weight: 1.57g.



2) Everted collar. Dimensions: 15.9mm by 8.25; Weight: 1.05g.



3) Everted and slightly curved collar. Dimensions: 20.5mm by 12.2mm; Weight: 2.12g.



4) Everted collar. Dimensions: 22.7mm by 10.4mm; Weight: 2.4g.



5) Curved possible sword hilt fragment. Dimensions: 16.9mm by 9.1mm; Weight: 1.68g.



6) Curved possible sword hilt fragment. Dimensions: 20.4mm by 16mm; Thickness: 1.7mm; Weight: 1.02g.



29. (SF 5 associated) Grouped with SF 5 from excavation is another fragment of a socketed axe. The fragment is 'L' shaped in plan and comprises the upper portion the axe, with a portion of the everted collar, face and side face with a near complete side loop. The fragment is dark green-grey in colour with areas of extensive light blue corrosion product. The slight remains of the face appear to indicate compression similar to SF 10, 8 and 19. This fragment does not fit with SF 5 but belongs with another, as yet unidentified axe.



Dimensions: 23.3mm by 17.6mm; collar thickness: 3.95; Weight: 15g.



30. (SF 7 associated) A secondary fragment of an everted collar from a square in plan socketed axe was associated with this find from excavation, but which is certainly from another, currently unidentified, axe. Dimensions: 21.7mm by 8.2mm; Weight: 1.83g.



31. (SF 9 associated) A further very small fragment, possibly from a handle was also found with this axe. It does not fit with SF 9 and thus belongs with another unidentified axe.



32. (SF 10 associated) Grouped with SF 10 from excavation is a small fragment, possibly an everted collar, of a socketed axe. Dimensions: 16.8mm by 16.5mm; Weight: 2.13g.



33. (SF 10 associated) Nine small copper-alloy fragments. All are thin and curved in plan, and are thus likely to belong to the fragmentary and incomplete sword hilt (SF 23). Dimensions: combined weight 3.52g.



Several additional fragments were recovered from the spoil during excavation. These have not been described or weighed but are almost certainly associated with the hoard, and thus ought to be considered potential treasure.



Not associated objects



34. (No SF) A fragment of a copper-alloy object of uncertain form, possibly a handle. The fragment is rectangular in plan with a slight curvature in section. One end shows signs of attachment with raised copper-alloy material on both surfaces and a slight recession to the top. The upper surface has two pronounced raised vertical ridges whilst the underside is plain (aside from two bulbous lumps at the attachment end). The fragment has a light green to red/brown colour.



This fragment is similar in appearance to vessel handles of Medieval date, and was recovered from an area outside of the closed Bronze Age hoard deposit. As it does not appear be of Bronze Age date or from the hoard this artefact should not be considered as an associated find and is therefore not treasure.



Dimensions: Length: 53.8mm; Width: 30.5mm; Thickness: 6.95mm (at ridge), 4.8mm (in recession); Weight: 59.27g.



35. A sub-lozengical fragment of black glazed Medieval to Modern sherd. The fabric is stoneware, and grey in colour, with glaze on both surfaces. Relief decoration is also visible on the exterior surface, with two raised circular forms and a series of cross-hatch detailing.



Dimensions: 21.5mm by 21.3mm; Weight: 2.18g.



36 - 38. Three small flints. These are white-grey in colour and do not appear to be worked. They are therefore not likely to be associated.



Discussion



The Cherry Burton hoard comprises of objects that are relatively common in Late Bronze Age British hoards of the Ewart Park phase (c.950-800 cal BC), which typically consist of complete and fragmentary swords, spearheads and socketed axeheads. The socketed axe types are well known from Northern England, with the type Yorkshire axes that make up the majority, very well represented in East Yorkshire, as the terminology would suggest (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223-39), furthermore, the probable type Alford axe (No. 18) is possibly related to the type Yorkshire group (Ibid., 188) The spearhead fragments are too fragmentary to type but Late Bronze Age spearheads are well known in the region (Davis 2012), including in hoards with socketed axeheads (e.g. the Bilton hoard, Yorkshire: ibid., pl. 151). In these respects the hoard is typical of the period and region. However, a number of points warrant additional comment.



The first point concerns the presence of an antennae sword pommel (No. 1) from a solid-hilted Late Bronze Age sword with Continental comparisons (Antennenschwerter: Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, 122-3). To date only eight other swords of this type have been recorded in Britain (Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, nos. 751-5; Needham 1987; PAS find: SUSS-761CD0; Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 327-8); of which only one example in a museum collection is complete (from the River Witham, Lincolnshire: Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, no. 751), the other complete example is the (lost) sword from the Isle of Skye, known only from antiquarian records and an illustration (Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 327-8, fig. 28.5). The remaining six swords are in a fragmentary condition. The Cherry Burton example is paralleled by four other cases in which the sword has been broken through the grip, but it does not otherwise appear to resemble closely any of the other antennae swords found in Britain. The fragmentary state of the Cherry Burton pommel also hinders detailed comparison with Continental forms.



The Cherry Burton pommel may not be the first discovery of this sword type from Yorkshire. The example from the British Museum collection (1858, 1116.1) listed by Colquhoun & Burgess (1981, no. 754) as coming from 'Provenance unknown' (but actually from either Yorkshire or the River Thames) lacks its antennae pommel. The British Museum's acquisitions register for 1858 details that this find was made in Yorkshire. This statement predates the posthumous publication of Kemble's Horae Ferales in 1863, in which he notes that the sword was already in the collection of British Museum but suggests it was found in the Thames (Kemble 1863, 162). The confusion could be due to the next entry in the British Museum register being a find that was from the bed of the Thames (the two entries are given one above the other). If the register had been misread then this could be the cause of the confusion, but the posthumous editing of Horae Ferales by usually diligent R.G. Latham and A.W. Franks suggest that this cannot be taken for granted and some doubt must remain. Nevertheless, the distribution of the known British antennae sword pommels is generally eastern and the Cherry Burton pommel corresponds to the pattern in this respect. This also corresponds with Cowie & O'Connor's suggestion that the British antennae pommel swords have Nordic rather than Central European connections.



In contrast to the elaborate spirals of the River Witham sword, the Cherry Burton 'spirals' are in fact solid loops.



Its simplicity is paralleled by the examples from Near Lewes, Sussex (SUSS-761CD0), Chertsey (Needham 1987, fig. 5.15, 1) and the find from Snettisham ('hoard IV') (Coombs 1974; Pendleton 199, no. 1677). This muted feature does occur on swords from the Continent, including a sword from Munich, Germany (e.g. Quillfeldt 1995: Taf. 75, no. 219), but seems to be a more recurrent trend among the - albeit small - number of known British examples (cf. O'Connor & Cowie's point regarding the lack of exact Continental parallels for the British antennae pommel swords: 2007, 328). The parallel with the Snettisham 'hoard IV' find is worth pursuing further: it was one of the fragments broken through the grip and was found in direct association with objects of Ewart Park date (including socketed axes) that had, as at Cherry Burton, been intentionally damaged and fragmented. Both the Snettisham and Cherry Burton hoards included an example of a socketed axe with another object blocking its socket. The Cherry Burton hoard therefore helps to strengthen the case for placing antennae pommel swords in the context of the Ewart Park complex (cf. Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 328).



A further notable feature of the Cherry Burton hoard is the purposeful damage to several axes (Nos. 8, 11, 16, 19 & 30 in the catalogue). The range of evidence compression, the possible application of heat and the presence of axe fragments blocking the socket of another axe. This prevalence of this type of treatment in Late Bronze Age hoards from across Europe has been discussed recently by Mörtz (forthcoming) and could be related to recycling or more ritualized decommissioning prior to deposition. The prevalence and character of this treatment deserves greater attention in future research and studies.

Thanks are due to Dr Brendan O'Connor for comments on an earlier draft of this report. However, all errors reside with the authors.","Due to their age and grouping of more than two items, this find qualifies as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage and so as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure (Designation) Order 2002. The ceramic and flint material, along with item number 34 (a possible Medieval handle), are not thought to be associated with the hoard and thus do not constitute potential Treasure.

581284,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-700,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) socketed axe of Late Bronze Age dating (950 to 700 BC).



The axe is sub-rectangular in shape with a flared convex cutting edge and the socket is sub square in cross section. The socket of the axe is sub square, with an irregular mouth. The socket is 44.8 mm deep. The top edge of the socket shows little evidence of casting jets that have been trimmed flush with the socket mouth. A raised band (9.6 mm deep) is present at the level of the top of the loop beyond to the mouth of the socketed axe. The loop is well preserved and relatively small and wide with a irregular lentoid shaped cross section. It measures 14.0 mm in length and 5.4 mm wide. It is positioned below the raised band.The horizontal cast moulding is present on both faces and the edges of the axe; however this is better preserved on one face. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade.The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion.



The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion. Here a lighter green area can be seen, predominately around the blade edge, socket and the edge of the loop. These areas of exposed metal should be monitored for signs of active corrosion (bright greeny powdery residue). To reduce the risk of this occurring, the axe head should be stored in an dry acid-free environment, such as a sealed tupperware box, with silica gel and acid free tissue paper.



The axe measures  65.7 mm in length, 25.5 mm wide (at the socket), 31.4 mm wide (at the cutting edge), is 24.4 mm thick (socket) and 3.7 mm thick (cutting edge). It weighs 70.5 grams. 



Two similar socketed axes have been published as no 28 (probably from East Anglia) and 31 (Oundle, Northamptonshire) in Watson (1993, 6). These are considered to be Late Bronze Age in dating (Needham Period 7, c. 950 BC to c. 700 BC).

The spearhead is largely, though not entirely complete. The entire head has been cast integral, with a conical socket retaining lozenge-shaped sideloops near the base of the socket.

583703,Razor,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-800,"Incomplete cast copper alloy razor or knife, semi-circular in plan, with part of the circular perforation remaining that was probably for a wooden shaft or handle. The perforation has since broken so that the full extent of the curved upper edge is not known, but the opposite straight side of the razor tapers to a sharp edge. Both sides of the blade are beveled, from about 10 mm in from the edge. Perhaps its asymmetrical shape is due to it having been modified from another tool or artefact in prehistory. Similar perforated triangular examples have been found at Phillack, Hayle in Cornwall (TRURI 1701.124) and in Northwest France. These have been traditionally associated with 'Hog's back' knives and are dated from the Late Bronze Age but they have more in common with the 'Racloir' types found in Northwest France; and the latest find from Trevalga, Tintagel of a mould for a triangular razor or 'racloir' has been dated from the Middle Bronze Age, during the Taunton phase of metalwork, c.1400-1300 cal BC (Jones A M and Quinnell, H forthcoming. 'Lines of archaeological investigation along the north Cornish coast').



A triangular perforated razor or knife is recorded in SOMDOR-FFE225 and dated from c.1020 - 800 BC (Ewart Park metalwork phase) and is identified as one of the Carp's Tongue Complex knives, similar to the more commonly known 'hog's back' variety of knife. These triangular shaped knives are strangely absent from finds in the Low Countries on the Continent, and are very rare in the rest of Central or Northern Europe, apart from the 'Racloir' type of triangular knife found in Northwest France.



Until recently, perforated racloirs have also been grouped in France with the Late Bronze Age Carp's tongue sword complex, Bronze final IIIb (Burgess 1968, 38, Fig.13, 11). However, at least two examples have recently been identified in the Rosnoën phase in France, of Bronze final I, similar to our Penard phase, which dates from c.1300-1100 BC.



A similar example of a semi-circular knife can be seen in KENT-A6C993, which is incomplete but has been identified as hog's back knife or razor and dated from c.1020-800 BC, and has been compared to similar knives found in the Boughton Malherbe Hoard (2011 T464 and KENT-15A293). ""KENT-A6C993 is in very good condition, apart from being broken, and it is indeed a hog's back knife. These tend to have an irregular five-sided outline and often some kind of ridge parallel to the long edge. CORN-28E916 could fit with the outline of a hog's back knife, but would have had to suffer differential erosion of a rather unlikely kind"" (Brendan O'Connor pers comm). O'Connor (1980, 179) includes the 'hogs-back' knives found in Britain amongst the Carp's Tongue hoards, and notes their similarity to the sub-rectangular or rectangular perforated knives found on the continent, particularly in Breton hoards. These knives are generally found across Southern-Eastern England, with a strong presence in Kent.



The closest parallel is illustrated in Piggott's paper on The Late Bronze Age Razors of the British Isles in PPS Vol.XII (1946) on page 138, Fig.8, No.45, which is classified as a Class II razor hybrid from Bishops Stortford in Essex (now in the British Museum).



Another hog's back knife with a perforation towards the upper angled edge is illustrated in Burgess (1968) on page 38, Fig.13, No.10, which is grouped with the Carp's Tongue Complex, dating from c.1000-800 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of razors or knives from Hayle, Cornwall and Charlcombe, Somerset on pages 423 & 507, Plates 16 & 111, Nos.127 & 621, which are referred to as Hog's back knives.","Report from X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy analysis by Kathryn Moore at Camborne School of Mines:

Balance (gasses etc) 52.42%



The mix of elements found in the razor, listed above, suggests that the object was made of a copper alloy that is typical of that used during the Bronze Age (Dr Peter Northover pers comm).

The spear is dated from the Penard Phase - Ewart Park so c1200-750BC (Needham period 6-7). Ehremburg notes that there is a sub-classification that she calls 'short stumpy' types (p15) which have a length of less than 100mm with the width of the blade being approximately 1/3 the length.

584061,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, sub-triangular in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade (not flanged), tapering to a narrow rounded butt end, which is 13 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 35 mm. The length of the flat axe is only 90 mm so it is about half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now very pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axe on page 502, Plate 69, No.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, and a short but wider example of a broad Migdale type flat axe from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall, on page 418, Plate 12, No.98c, which both are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axe with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, Fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.



There are similar miniature Migdale type flat axes recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a 'Biggar' variant of the Migdale type of flat axe, but these have slightly crescentic blades.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

584168,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1300,"Incomplete cast copper alloy side-looped palstave, missing its blade, with just the flanged butt end remaining, which was used to haft the axe to its wooden handle. There is less of the left flange remaining than the right flange which retains the raised casting seam that has not been filed away, running longitudinally from the butt end to the broken edge. The left side is more corroded and has been marked with an incision, parallel to the remains of the casting seam, running the length of the side of the flange. The casting seams are also off-centre, which suggests that the two-part mould may have not been perfectly alligned. There is a slight recess, partly caused by damage, below the deep stop ridge which transverses the width of the axe between the high flanged sides. But there is not enough detail to determine any moulded marks in order to be sure of the type of palstave. There are two raised areas on one side of the palstave, however, which represent the remains of the base of the side loop. Much of the original surface of the palstave is also missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface that remains is quite pitted and has many recessed circular facets, which suggests that it has been in a suitably wet or corrosive environment to develop such areas of bronze disease. There is active light green powdering from bronze disease in one of the pits, but corrosion is generally stable. The side loops begin to be added to the sides of palstaves during the Taunton phase of metalwork, during the Middle Bronze Age, from about 1400 BC, and continue through the Penard phase, until about 1100 BC.

584231,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1150,410,"A Late Bronze Age to Roman (1150BC - AD410) copper alloy miniature socketed axehead: The axe is rectangular in plan with slightly concave parallel sides. The blade edge and blade tips are rounded, but not flared. The socket mouth has a rectangular internal edge, the exterior forms a asymmetrical rectangle with convex edges, particularly on narrow edge. In profile the axe an elongated triangle. Both profile faces are heavily abraded and no casting seam is visible. One profile face has the remains of a loop. The surface of the axe has an incomplete heavy brown patina, otherwise the surface has a mottled red/green matte patina where the surface is abraded. The axe measures 30.74mm long, 19.78mm wide, 12.02mm thick and weighs 14.2g. The interior of the mouth socket measures 11.86mm long and 7.13mm wide. The socket is 15.18mm deep.



The dating of miniature axeheads is from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period, although they are more common from the Roman period. Their function is probably as an amulet or votive. This example is more faithful to Late Bronze Age socketed axeheads than miniature axeheads usually are, and the heavy patina supports this. But Kiernan (Kiernan, P. 2009 Miniature Votive Offerings in the Roman North West Verlag p. 145-7) highlights the possible link between the 're-use of prehistoric axes in Roman period sanctuaries, and the dedication of miniature axes.' He lists Roman sanctuary sites which have produced prehistoric axes, some of which include miniautes axes as Richborough, Nettleton, Wycomb, and Silchester (ibid: 146).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-07-02T23:00:00Z,2013-10-01T23:00:00Z,,,14.2,,,12.02,30.74,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Stratford-on-Avon,Claverdon,SP2064,,52.27379194,-1.70830692,WAW-80FB93,,WAW-80FB93.jpg,"Bronze Age to Roman miniature socketed axe (plan, profile, plan and terminal).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-80FB93.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/444812.jpg

Modern damage central to the end of the butt can be identified by the lack of patina. The long side-edges of the axe are slightly flanged (being c.0.5mm thicker at the very edge than just inside it), with the stop ridge on the surface being just off centre to the widest section of the flanged sides, 48.2mm from the butt and 59.0mm from the blade. The stop ridge is 9mm thick, tapering to either end where it measures 2.45mm at the butt and 3.20mm at the blade. In plan, the blade flares outwards to form a crescent shape and is evenly curved but slightly asymmetrical. This axe is abraded and pitted overall, and has small patches of a dark green patina. This patina shows numerous vertical scratches and it is uncertain whether this is the result of the metal working procedure, or post depositional. There is no indication of any decoration.

Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face of the ingot is smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and coppery red areas of decay, and the sides and the base of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

586758,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1850,-1750,"An incomplete cast copper alloy developed flat axe, of Early to Middle Bronze Age (1850 BC to 1750 BC) dating.



The axe is a narrow butted flat axe with a median bevel / proto stop ridge 61.2 mm from the butt end. It has tapering sides, which extend slightly above the front and back faces of the axe, a flat butt and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders. The cutting edge was crescentric in plan and measures 2.5 mm thick and 52.0 mm wide. The butt is 20.3 mm wide and 3.9 mm thick. The width at the median bevel / proto stop ridge is 30.4 mm and it is 14.9 mm thick. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself.



In total the axehead measures 118.3 mm in length, with a maximum width of 52.0 mm and a maximum thickness of 14.9 mm. It weighs 242.2 g.



The axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has flaked away from the surface in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green area. These areas should be monitored regularly for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This would be visible as a bright green powdery residue appearing on the surface of the flat axehead. To reduce this risk, the axehead should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.



The object can be classified as a developed flat axe most probably an undecorated type Bandon (corresponding to Type Derryniggin in Ireland). These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V), which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. The flat axe probably dates from c.1850-1750 BC.



Similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c. 1750 - 1600 BC.

588838,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete and corroded Middle Bronze Age cast copper-alloy Group I or III palstave (1500-1300 BC). A copper alloy palstave with shield shaped pattern below the stop ridge, and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with rounded blade tips, one tip in particular is heavily abraded. The surface of the blade has traces of hammer marks forming lines which cross the blade. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the nicks at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. On both faces of the palstave there is a prominent stop-ridge, one of which has a swallow hole (casting flaw) behind it, on the septum. This face also has an indistinct shield decoration below the stop-ridge on the blade face. The other side this shield decoration is not visible, and this may be due to the heavy abrasion and pitting. The flange sides are an asymmetrical lozenge in plan, and on the septrum faces the flange facets are higher on one face than the other. The septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, which is damaged due to another casting flaw. The surface has patches of a drk green/brown patina, otherwise it is heavily pitted, abraded and has some active corrosion occurring. The palstave measures 166.79mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 65.5mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 31.68mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 494.1g.



The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group I or III type which has a shield like decoration below the stop ridge. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).","

590538,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-750,"A gold alloy 'finger shaped' ingot. The ingot is broadly rectangular in plan with a facetted oval / plano-convex shaped cross section. The ingot tapers in width from a bulbous terminal to a slender section which is broken; the break is recent, fresh and unabraded. The bulbous end has a slightly faceted section. There is no evidence of hammer marks or small striations, the surface is slightly pitted through corrosion and abrasion. The ingot is a yellow colour with a smooth surface.





Dimensions:

The ingot measures: 35.6mm length, 10.7mm maximum width, 7.9mm maximum thickness; and it weighs 22.8 grams





Metal content:

Analysis using surface XRF undertaken at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery / Birmingham Museums Trust shows the ingot is composed of

Gold (Au) 79.8%, Silver (Ag) 14.6%, Copper (Cu) 5.7%. The analysis of the ingot was undertaken on a clean and unabraded section of the break - giving analysis from the core of the ingot





Discussion:

Ingots of this size, shape and composition are notoriously difficult to date / identify to specific archaeological periods. The lack of hammer marks and other decorative features also make this task additionally problematic. The gold composition (above) does not preclude a Bronze Age date but it is unlikely to be of Early Bronze Age date. The copper content suggests it was added as an alloying ingredient and the gold/silver ratio could be natural alluvial gold. A similar planeo-convex ingot was discovered within a hoard of gold bracelets from Llanarmon-yn-ial, Denbighshire. (NGMW accession number: 82.93H/1-5/ Green 1982). As such it is possible to suggest that this example dates from the later Bronze Age c. 1500 - 750 BC)","I believe that both the precious metal content (gold and silver) of the ingot and the date of manufacture in the later Bronze Age fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act.

590761,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-800,"A fragment of an ingot or, perhaps more likely, an incomplete piece of goldwork from the production process. Half of the fragment has been hammered into a bar with a relatively regular square cross-section. The end appears to have been cut. The remainder of the fragment has not been as highly worked and is a relatively irregular sub-rectangular shape that tapers away to a thinner cross-section. It is not clear whether this end has been cut or whether it has broken.



The more highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a fragment with rectangular profile from Chalvington with Ripe in East Sussex (Treasure case: 2008 T425). The less highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a number of probable prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) ingot fragments, including examples from Brabourne in Kent (Treasure case: 2005 T259), Trowse with Newton, Norfolk (Treasure case: 2002 T99), and the more substantial finger-shaped ingot from East Claydon, Buckinghamshire (2013 T850) and West Knoyle in Wiltshire (Treasure case: 2014 T686). It can, therefore, on the balance of probabilities, be considered to be of prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) date.



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken on the surface of the gold by the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 91-92% gold, 6-7 % silver and approximately 2% copper. This is consistent with a Bronze Age date.

One of these is slightly curved the other is set at 12 degrees to the axis of the hammer. Much of the hammer's original surface is lost but what remains is covered with fine, transverse striations suggesting finishing. The face of the hammer is rounded and set at 6 degrees to its axis, although worn it retains traces of striations. The casting flash abuts transverse mouldings run, parallel to the face, across each side of the hammer.

Peter Reavill comments that Double edged razors have a distribution which was ""Widespread across Britain and Ireland, particularly in the Midlands, Yorkshire, Wessex and the Thames area."" He goes on to cite The PAS Bronze Age Guide by Ben Roberts, that: ""The term double-edged razor covers three broad types of the same implement; those that were handled, [those] with a pierced tang, and [those] with a non-pierced tang. Representing the earliest form of copper-alloy razor, these varied in shape, starting initially with the handled examples which resembled spearheads (i.e. elongated triangular-edges, with one or two rivet holes at the base for affixing a handle. The tanged varieties were more leaf shaped, echoing the styles that came afterwards. The overall shape and size of these razors varied slightly across different regions of continental Europe, resulting in many different typologies and sub-categories.""

594585,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A folded fragment of a Middle Bronze Age gold bracelet or ring with a bundle of compressed gold ribbons wedged within the fold. (c. 1500-c. 1100 BC). Treasure case no. 2014 T15.



The object is largely sub-rectangular in plan, rectangular in cross-section and has been folded widthways through c. 180°. The narrow end is in the form of a hook-like terminal and is square in cross-section. The sides flare outwards from the hook to form a 'tab' with a break at the end. Part of the break is uneven and probably accidental and the other part has been deliberately chopped obliquely. Both faces are plain and have small scuffs and scratches. The bundle is formed by numerous thin and narrow ribbons which have been tightly compressed together. Following its discovery the bundle was detached by the finder in order to remove soil.



The artefact is closely paralleled by two conjoined objects classified as rings (possibly ear ornaments), from Binstead, West Sussex (TAR: 1998-1999, p. 10-11, fig. 3a).



A similar object, classified as a bracelet, has been recorded from Northfleet, Kent (TAR: 2004 T326; PAS: KENT-AAA333).



In discussing the Kent bracelet, Stuart Needham has commented:



'Its features do match those of a type of bracelet which occurs in just two Welsh hoards, from Capel Isaf, Dyfed, and Maesmelan Farm, Powys. The type, known as Capel Isaf, comprises a flat band strengthened by triangular-section beadings along either edge. At either terminal the band tapers quickly to a hooked tang, one of which is rod-like, the other a flatter strip; these two interlock to close the bracelet. The Northfleet fragment appears to have had a narrower band than the Welsh parallels, but its metal composition is similar with low copper and between about 9 and 16 % silver. Making this identification does not necessarily offer definitive dating since the type is not associated with datable objects. The Capel Isaf hoard contains, in addition to two of this type, two more broad-band bracelets which are plainer in design, and a small fragment of twisted strip which is likely to be the terminal of another ornament (Savory 1977: 37-53; Savory 1980: no 302, 195 fig. 46, pl. VIII). The Maesmelan Farm hoard has a simple rectangular section penannular bracelet in association with one of Capel Isaf type (Green et al 1983: 394-398). The prevailing opinion is that these are of Bronze Age date and, if so, they are likely to date to before the middle of the Bronze Age (circa 1500/1400 BC), after which the copper content of the gold rises significantly. A mature Early Bronze Age or earliest Middle Bronze Age date is feasible and would tie in with a similar date for the Heyope ribbon torcs with similar terminals from a hoard in Powys.'



Bracelet or ring: 32.61mm (length); 65.80mm (length if straightened); 15.38mm (width); 1.29mm (thickness). Weight: 7.81g.

Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a group of eight ornaments was undertaken by Sue La Niece at the British Museum. It indicated a surface composition for the bracelet fragment of approximately 89-91% gold, 8-10 % silver with approximately 1% copper. The surface composition of the wire is approximately 86-88% gold, approximately 10-12% silver and approximately 1% copper.The full report is appended.",The find contains a minimum of 10% gold and predates 1714.

595407,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1140,"An incomplete copper alloy Bronze Age (1275-1140 BC) arrowhead, missing its tip and the ends of the barbs. There is a large crack where the tang joins the rest of the arrowhead, which has nearly split it into two parts.



Cast in a two piece mould, this arrowhead is barbed and tanged in form, with the two sides forming an angle of approximately 30 degrees. It is 41.50mm long (approximately 20mm of the original length is missing), 17.45mm wide from barb to barb, 3.20mm thick and weighs 5.46g. The tang is complete and measures c.22.90mm long, 8.20mm wide and 2.50mm thick. The arrowhead has a low mid rib, giving the object a lozengiform section. Much of the original surface survives with a dark green patina, but it is heavily scratched and pitted. The exposed surfaces are mid green in colour, but there are patches of red suggesting it was deposited in ground containing iron.



There is only one bronze arrowhead from a secure Bronze Age context in Britain and that was in the Penard hoard, first reported in Archaeologica 71, page 138. The Penard arrowhead also has a mid rib. At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import as there are numerous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France.



However, thanks to an increase in the number of reported metal detected finds, Bronze Age bronze arrowheads are now growing in number, though they remain a rare group of artefact. Dr Colin Pendleton reports that Suffolk has 17 known examples, of which 5 can be termed barbed and tanged. Norfolk has at least 4 recorded and more examples are being added to the database from around the country. This suggests that bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition.



Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age to the Middle Bronze Age, the evidence from Penard, which dates from 1275-1140 BC, suggests that copper alloy arrowheads did not come into fashion until later in the Middle Bronze Age. Therefore this is the suggested date range for this arrowhead.

595700,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete developed flat axe with hammer raised flanges of later Early Bronze Age date (c. 2000 CAL BC to c. 1700 CAL BC).



Around 25% of the axehead is present, with the blade and part of the body present. The butt and rest of the body is missing, presumed lost in antiquity. The break is patinated, suggesting that it happened in antiquity.



The axehead is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. At the break, the body of the axehead measures 26.4 mm wide and 12.9 mm thick. Neither the septum or the median bevel are present. The flanges are lozenge-shaped and are likely to have been raised rather than cast. In profile they are D shape and eroded projecting a maximum of 1.0 mm above the body of the axe. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 68.0 mm. There are a series of patinated striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These may be a result of sharpening the cutting edge.



Overall the developed axe fragment measures 47.7 mm in length, 68.0 mm wide and 12.2 mm thick. It weighs 94.9 g.



The axe is a mid brown colour with an even surface patina. There are a couple of areas of pitting where the patina is no longer present, leaving a lighter green area.



Although incomplete the classification of the axe matches the descriptions and illustrations of the axe type Arreton ( (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp65 - 75 specifically 409, 411 and 421) which is dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 CAL BC to 1700 CAL BC. Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

discussion of the type, taken from HESH-07CD71: This axe can be classified as a Socked Axe of type Meldreth, possibly being sub-classified as a Variant Aylsham. This style / type of axe has a common distribution in the East of England. The majority of axes of this style have historically been found in the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire. The distribution pattern continues to a lesser degree in South-East England (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981: 211). However, a number of Meldreth Type axes have been found in hoards associated with South-Wales Types and Ewart Park Swords, for example the Stogursey Hoard, Somerset (ibid, 210). This is reflected in a local Marches distribution where they have been treated as exotics occurring in a Ewart Park phase hoard from Pencoyd, Herefordshire (HESH-802833) and a broken and damaged faceted axe from Westbury, Shropshire (HESH-F8A521).",Found very close to BH-A50566 (2013T655) and BH-0E91D6.

Less than 50% of the axehead is present, consisting only of part of the lower body, blade and the remnants of the socket. It is missing the top part of the socket and the also the loop. The axe is sub rectangular in plan, with an expanded / flared convex, but abraded cutting edge. The socket is sub rectangular in section. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to the base of socket is 9.8 mm. The break is old and patinated. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. Raised casting seams are present, along both sides, these have been trimmed and hammered flat / finished. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is incomplete. The sides do not appear to be faceted and no ribs are present on either the front or back of the axehead fragment. The axe is most likley to be of a North Wales ribbed type, or faceted axe with a large collar. The axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface. Multiple stratch marks are present on both the front and back of the axehead - these are modern and cut into the patinated surface.

601263,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Two pieces of a late Bronze Age socketed knife dating from about 950 - 750 BC. The knife is of Thorndon type and is from the Ewart Park phase, Needham Period 7, and Burgess Metalworking Stage XII.



The upper part of the blade and the lower part of the socket survive. The break between the two pieces is more recent than the other breaks.



The double edged blade has a flattened mid rib section with wide (4-5mm) concave edge bevels. The blade is 21.8mm wide at the socket end and 17.6mm wide at the break. It tapers from 6mm thick to 5.1mm thick.



The junction between the socket and blade was straight. The socket is sub rectangular in section and has straight sides. It tapers in width from 23.7mm wide at the attachment end to 21.5mm at the narrowest point near the blade, and in thickness from 12.96mm at the attachment end to 7.8mm at the blade end, then flares widthways and thickens immedieately before the blade to 24.8mm by 7.85mm. There is a single circular peghole through both faces of the socket in the centre of the surviving piece. It has a diameter of 4.5 - 5mm. The walls of the socket are about 2mm thick.



The socket fragment is 42.68mm long, and the blade fragment is 36.6mm long. The knife has a well developed green patina.

601331,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy blade, of Middle Bronze Age dating (1500 CAL BC to 1150 CAL BC - Needham's Period 5).



The blade fragment is sub trapezoidal in plan, and lentoid in cross section. The blade tapers towards either edge. The edges to the top and bottom are old, pre depostional breaks. The remains of a circular rivet hole are present on the top edge. No decoration is present on either the front or back of the blade.



It measures 63.5 mm in length, has a maximum width of 19.3 mm and a minimum of 13.4 mm. It is 3.1 mm thick in the centre of the blade and 1.2 mm thick along the blade edges. It weighs 13.0 g.



The blade fragment is a mid to dark brown colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has been removed in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze diseases) occurring. This would be a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue and silica gel.","A similar blade fragment was recorded as WMID-277BF6. On that record, Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) noted that: As for the blade fragment - from the size I think you are looking at either a large dagger or probably more likely a rapier fragment. The hilt would have been trapezoidal - and it has lost its rivets and upper part - it has also lost the shoulders but you can then see the blade thickening away from the hilt to for the mid rib. I expect the other end continued for maybe 1/3 again as the rib is parallel even if the sides aren't due to plough roll.

The head of the pin expands to a disc and has a hollow terminal that would have held a stone. Immediately behind the head, the shaft narrows to 4.3mm diameter before expanding into a swollen area with a maximum diameter of 6.34mm diameter. The shaft then tapers again to the well patinated break.



The whole of the surviving shaft is decorated, though the surface layer of the pin is missing in places. below the expanded head are five circumferential grooves, then a panel of longitudinal diagonal lines form chevrons. the thickest part of the swelling is decorated with diagonal cross hatching, flanked on each side by another five circumferential grooves. The lower shaft is more damaged, but appears to be another panel of diagonal cross hatching and another band of circumferential lines.



The metal is dark grey with areas of dark green where the surface is missing.



This is a large and highly decorative rare item that would be worn with the intention of display, most likely used on an external garment such as a cloak or something similar.

It is missing the ends of both lower tips due to old, patinated breaks. The object is cast in the round with a swollen oval body that tapers downwards at both sides to the now incomplete pointed terminals giving it an inverted U-shaped form. At the centre of the body is a slight vertical band or constriction, either side of which the exterior surfaces of the object has decoration comprising multiple ridges and grooves. These run from the central constriction towards the pointed terminals, finishing just before the sides narrow to the terminals. Unlike some parallels, this object is not perforated.



All the surfaces of the object have a dark grey green patina, with some pitting and patches of corrosion in places.



Record SF-B58222 explains: ""The precise date range of these unusual objects remains uncertain, although several examples have now been recorded through the PAS. Examples from the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998) were found alongside Bronze Age metalwork but with deposition in the Iron Age. Examples from Suffolk (SF-520513 and SF-9183) were found loosely associated with a scatter of Middle Bronze Age finds, as was an example from Methwold, Norfolk, and more recently an example from an excavated Middle Bronze Age context from Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (cf.

Axe 1 South Wales (Stogursey) variant Type Found c.0.6m below surface with blade to the south The axe is near-complete, with some damage to the blade edge (with a length of 105.3mm and a weight of 326.1g). The sub-rectangular mouth (50.8mm x 44.6mm) is flat-topped, slightly bevelled inwards. Remnant stubs of four casting runners are discernible on the mouth, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The socket is sub-rectangular at the mouth (36.9mm x 29.5mm and 80.8mm deep), with sides gradually converging to its base. The mouth has a single moulding (7mm long) sloping to the face (5-6mm high). The loop springs from the base of the moulding and is of irregular D-shaped section (32.7mm long, 6.5mm wide, 5mm thick; with internal dimensions of 6.7mm long and 6.7mm high). The sides are very gently concave before diverging at the blade to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (59.1mm wide), with some damage to one of the blade tips and the blade edge. The sides have a slight bevel to the casting seam at the centre, producing a sub-rectangular to hexagonal body section. Both casting seams are clearly discernible and have been fettled, probably by hammering. The faces are decorated with near-parallel ribs; one face has five ribs, while the other has three ribs with the edges enhanced with a rib each. Both faces are slightly convex across their widths. The faces and gradually converge and have a weak blade facet (26mm from the blade edge). The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved and sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces.



Axe 2 probably Type Welby Found c.3cm below axe 1 with blade to the east The axe is complete (with a length of 97.8mm and a weight of 267.1g). The sub-oval mouth (44.9mm x 41.7mm) is flat-topped, slightly bevelled outwards. Only one casting stub is now evident with the casting seams on the sides but is likely to have been two-runner casting technology. The socket is sub-oval at the mouth (34.0mm x 30.5mm and 74.7mm deep), with sides gradually converging to its base. There is a distinct dollar (16mm long), which is concave across its length and bounded by a horizontal moulding at its base. The casting flashes on the collar appear unfinished (with a height of up to 3.7mm); below the collar, the flashes have undergone more fettling from hammering. The sides are concave and are expanded at the blade (to give a blade width of 51.5mm) to produce a moderately rounded blade edge. The casting seams are not central but deeper to one side. The loop springs from the base of the collar and is of sub-triangular section (28mm long, 7.6mm wide, 4.4mm thick; with internal dimensions of 4.7mm long and 7.0mm high). The ribs also descend from the base of the collar; each face has three-ribs, which are convergent on one face and near-parallel on the other but are angled and are not parallel with the sides. The body section is sub-rectangular with convex faces and sides. The faces are also convex across their lengths. Weak blade facets are evident (18mm from the blade edge). The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved and some striations are evident below the patina, running perpendicular to the blade but are not consistent and may not be the result of sharpening.



Axe 3 South Wales (Stogursey) variant Type Found touching axe 4 The axe is complete (with a length of 89.0mm and a weight of 263.5g). The sub-rectangular mouth (48.5mm x 42.9mm) is flat-topped and has remnant stubs of four casting runners, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The socket is sub-rectangular at the mouth (34.8mm x 27.7mm and 70.8mm deep), with sides gradually converging to its base. The mouth has a single moulding (7mm long) sloping to the face (4-6mm high). The loop springs from just beneath the base of the moulding and is of irregular oval section (32.7mm long, 6.5mm wide, 5mm thick; with internal dimensions of 6.7mm long and 6.7mm high). The sides are very gently concave before diverging at the blade to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (59.1mm wide), with some damage to one of the blade tips and the blade edge. The sides have a slight bevel to the casting seam at the centre, producing a sub-rectangular to hexagonal body section. Both casting seams are clearly discernible and have been fettled, probably by hammering. The faces are decorated with near-parallel ribs; one face has five ribs, while the other has three ribs with the edges enhanced with a rib each. Both faces are slightly convex across their widths. The faces gradually converge and have a weak blade facet (26mm from the blade edge). The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved and sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces.



Axe 4 Type Found touching axe 3 The axe is complete (with a length of 91.2mm and a weight of 246.8g). The socket is sub-rectangular at the mouth (44.5mm x 37.1mm and 64.2mm deep), with concave sides gradually converging to its base. Traces of three, of the four runner stubs are evident on the mouth. The axe has a collar moulding (16mm long) with a slight concavity along its length. The loop springs from just above the base of the moulding and is of irregular triangular section (26mm long, 6.5mm wide, 6mm thick; with internal dimensions of 12.3mm long and 5.3mm high). The sides are concave, before diverging more sharply at the blade and produce a moderately expanded blade edge (53.5mm wide) and with moderate curve to the blade edge. The sides have prominent and high casting seams (up to 4.5mm high), suggesting minimal finishing and fettling. Either side of the casting seam, the sides are slightly convex across their widths, producing a sub-rectangular body section. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, descending from the base of the collar moulding. One face has three fine converging ribs, which are comparatively long and continue onto the blade (55m long, ending 21mm from the blade edge). The other face appears to have had wider ribs and which are parallel to each other. Both faces are convex across their widths and lengths. The faces gradually converge and have no discernible blade facet. Although the surface survives well on one face, there are no discernible sharpening striations on the blade. The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved with green corrosion and forming a raised ridge on one face, suggesting the point of contact with axe 3.



Axe 5 Type Breiddin The axe is complete (with a length of 96.9mm and a weight of 212.8g). The socket is sub-rectangular at the mouth (39.4mm x 32.2mm and 64.0mm deep), with straight sides gradually converging to its base. Three possible runner stubs are discernible on the mouth but are not certain. The axe has a collar moulding (14mm long) with a slight concavity along its length. The loop springs from just above the base of the moulding and is of irregular lozenge section (24mm long, 6.5mm wide, 4mm thick; with internal dimensions of 12.0mm long and 5.4mm high). The sides are gently concave, before diverging more sharply at the blade and produce a moderately expanded blade edge (45.8mm wide) which is distinctly straight. The sides have prominent casting seams, with some, neat finishing and fettling and seemingly deliberately leaving the seam as a regular moulding. Either side of the casting seam, the sides are slightly convex across their widths, producing a sub-rectangular body section, which is more comparatively angular. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, descending from the base of the collar moulding (36mm - 40mm long). Both faces are gently convex across both their widths and lengths. The faces gradually converge and have no discernible blade facet. The surface has a dark-brown patina, with patches of surface loss on the both blades. There are a few striations running along the blade but not enough to convincingly suggest sharpening.","Formerly known as NMGW-C9E5A3, which was a duplicate ID caused by system error.",3,Copper alloy,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,,,,,,,,5,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Madley,SO3939,,52.04602109,-2.89086524,NMGW-C9E5A3Z,,Axe Head 5.jpg,Late Bronze Age bronze Axe 5,Mark Lodwick,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Axe Head 5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/458240.jpg

The terminals appear to have been twisted prior to the purported breaks (possibly in the process of breaking them). The band has several bends and distortions and it is not clear what the original profile of the band would have been. There are a number of scuffs and striations to both surfaces. Possible small hammer markings can be seen, particularly on one side of the band. The remnants of a possible small perforation (c.0.2mm diameter) can be seen on one of the broken shoulders/terminals.

Metal composition 



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a gold fragment found at 'the Wantage rally, Oxon', indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-88% gold, 10-12 % silver with approximately 1% copper.



Identification & discussion



The uncertainty regarding whether the terminals have been broken (and therefore the original form of the band) makes it difficult to be certain of its date. However, a number of parallels from the Portable Antiquities Scheme (Northfleet, Kent: Treasure Case 2004 T326, Brixton Deverill, Wiltshire: 2006 T250, Gussage-all-Saints, Dorset: 2013 T428 and Roche, Corwall: 2014 T39), and the metal composition of the band, suggest that a Bronze Age date is most likely. As Dr S. Needham pointed out in the report for Brixton Deverill (2006 T250): 'a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings'. The Wantage find could be positioned within this group and probably dates to the Middle to Later Bronze Age (c.1500/1400-800 cal. BC), rather than any earlier.",The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.,3,Gold,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,,,2013T674,,3.94,,,0.7,74.47,1,Neil Wilkin,Neil Wilkin,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Wantage,,,,,PAS-446915,,2013T674a.JPG,Gold strip,The British Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2013T674a.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/458922.jpg

A fragment of a copper alloy socketed axe. The fragment consists of the mouth and an unlooped side of a socketed axe. Due to the fragmentary nature of the axe, it is difficult to confidently assign a type; however based on the mounded collar, mouth and overall slender appearance, it is possibly of South-Eastern type (Needham 1990, 28). The casting seams are visible and it would appear that the axe has been horizontally squashed, creating a pinched appearance. The object has a smooth surface and is covered with green patina; there is soil debris attached to the interior.

A damaged copper alloy socketed axe. One face is almost entirely complete, with a large piece of the cutting-edge missing; the other face is also missing a section of the mouth. The axe is undecorated and overall quite slender. The mouth is wide with casting remains on the rim, flashes are visible on the interior; the external casting seems are present on either side, but do not extend below the loop. Due to the fragmentary nature of the axe, it is difficult to ascertain a specific type, however it is likely of South-Eastern, Class A type (Needham 1990, 28). This type dates to the Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park phase, c. 920-800 BC (Needham et al. 1997, 82). The axe is covered with a green patina and the interior contains soil debris, which affects the object's weight.




Max. Length: 83.7 mm, Max. Width: 46.4 mm, Max. Thickness: 26.6 mm; Weight: 133.3 g.



The nature of this group of objects (ingot pieces and fragmentary objects) implies that they were deposited together and are related to the metalworking process, as they are typical of material which would be melted down and recycled.



The two socketed axe fragments are both likely to belong to the South-Eastern Type, Class A (Needham 1990, 28) and these objects can therefore be used to date the to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 920-800 BC). Parallel fragmentary examples have been found across Southern England, for example, as part of the Petters metalwork hoard (Needham 1990).



As the fragments (Nos. 1-21) are of Late Bronze Age date and appear to represent a single deposit of two or more copper alloy finds of prehistoric date, they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

The object consists of part of the open socket and one loop and part of the body of the probable axe. There is a casting seam visible that runs through and beyond the centre of the looped handle. The head-end of the object is flaring slightly, which is why it is assumed that this object represents a miniature axehead rather and any other type of tool. The patina and condition of this object suggests a Bronze Age date and although miniature objects were being made into the Roman period, full-sized axe heads of this type are known from the later Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,10.4,,,4.8,25.5,1,Anni Byard,Anni Byard,South East,Buckinghamshire,Aylesbury Vale,Aston Sandford,SP7607,From finder,51.7565422,-0.90032521,BERK-318611,,2013927.jpg,Bronze Age object: Miniature axehead,Oxfordshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013927.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/460731.jpg

The blade is rounded and asymmetrical and narrows moderately to meet the shaft; it is fairly sharp with no signs of impact damage. The shaft sides are slightly convex and fairly parallel. There are slight flanges visible on both faces of the axe along the edges of the shaft running from the base of the blade and reaching almost to the butt. The butt is rounded and quite sharp. There is a slight stop-ridge visible on one face. The blade is lenticular through its length, and, aside from the flanges, fairly flat across its width.



It would appear that, except for the effects of corrosion, the axe is largely intact.

607049,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1600,-400,"An unidentified cast copper-alloy object, a 'moustache' mount, so named because of its shape being reminiscent of a moustache. The object is cast in one piece and has a swollen body which tapers towards the pointed terminals. The centre of the body is narrowed and has a uniform vertical groove running around its girth to the underside or base of the object. At this point the grooves ends and abutts a circular recess, approximately 7.3 mm in diameter. All sides of the object are decorated with alternating ridges and grooves arranged horizontally. The narrowed terminals are without the ribbed decoration and corrosion has effected the very ends. With an undecorated end, some of these objects are reminiscent of hedgehogs.



A number of objects of this type have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database, however this is the largest example so far recorded. A similar object was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and as such they are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example. Their function is uncertain, although a circular recess at the bottom of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. A mount for a sword or dagger handle is the most obvious function but the absence of evidence makes this conjectural.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,34.7,,,12.8,58.53,1,Anni Byard,Anni Byard,South East,West Berkshire,West Berkshire,Boxford,SU4374,From a paper map,51.46334615,-1.38241981,BERK-719DA8,,2013951.jpg,Bronze Age object: 'Moustache' mount,Oxfordshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013951.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/461130.jpg
607149,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-750,"A late Bronze Age, cast copper alloy, socketed axehead decorated with skeuemorphic wings, probably a South Eastern type, probably of the Wilburton to Ewart Park traditions, dating from about 1100 - 750 BC, Needham period 6-7, which corresponds to metalworking stages X-XII.



The axehead is wedge shaped with a sub-circular socket at the haft end that has a double mouth moulding running round it; a prominent bulbous moulding forming the rim (wide and D shaped in section), and a much less well defined lower collar. A lumpy area on the back of this rim may be the remains of a casting jet. The body is rectangular in section, tapering towards the cutting edge where it flares outwards towards the tips of a slightly curved blade. The sides of the axe are slightly hollow where they curve out to the tip of the blade. There is no obvious blade bevel. The blade edge is slightly chipped and measures 50mm in width across the tips.



On one side of the mouth, projecting from the lower collar, is a D shaped attachment loop. It is 11.4mm wide and 25mm long, starting 15mm from the end of the axe. It is a pointed oval in section. Casting flashes remain on both edges of the axe, including the loop. They seem to have been trimmed, but are only smoothed flat near the blade. The axehead has a smooth, dark green patina. The socket was filled with soil when reported. Careful removal of the soil revealed the socket to be 84mm deep, and longitudinal ridges along the inside of the cavity, in the centre of the front and back faces of the axe.



The axe is decorated with faint mouldings on the front and back forming a ""moulded wing"" design. The front (when viewed with the loop at the top and to the right) has a central rib along the top half of the axe. This is flanked by a curved rib on each side which enclose a recessed shape of a rectangle with concave long sides. The ""back"" of the axe has a similar moulding, but instead of the central rib is a short chevron near the mouth, inside the curved ribs and pointing towards the cutting edge, and a more clearly defined ridge across the middle of the axe closing the rectangle with concave long edges. The top edge of the rectangle is the lower mouth moulding.



Some axes in Schmidt and Burgess have similar moulded decoration; specifically number 1280, plate 85, from York, 1287 from Heathery Burn, and also 1270 from Westow, East Yorkshire. Similar axes are more common in the South.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-02-07T00:00:00Z,2014-02-06T00:00:00Z,,,309,,,41.5,113.8,1,Peter Reavill,Jack Coulthard,Yorkshire and the Humber,Wakefield,Wakefield,Castleford Central and Glasshoughton,SE4625,GPS (from the finder),53.7193904,-1.30441382,SWYOR-816E11,,PAS_2309_axe1.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2309_axe1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/465589.jpg
607433,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1125,"An incomplete copper alloy socketed, spearhead  dating from the later Middle Bronze Age, about 1400 – 1125 BC. The main body of the spear survives but the tip and part of the blade are missing. The hollow circular socket is triangular in plan and tapers to a raised central ridges from which the blades extend to both sides. Though incomplete the blade appears to have been leaf-shaped in plan with a pointed oval section. There are two worn holes on both blades to either side of the central spines where it meets the shaft. These basal loops are indicative of spearheads of the Taunton and Penard phases, 1400 – 1125 BC (Davis, 2017), and this type corresponds with Davis Group 8.



There is a break between the blade and the socket shaft which has been glued back together post-excavation by the finder.



The object has a mid grey-green patina. It is 124.62mm long and 35.34mm wide. The socket shaft is 63.77mm long and the blade is 59.94mm long. The central ridge is 12.05mm wide and the blade is only 1.80mm thick. It weighs 94g.

There are traces of a slight raised rib on the butt end of both sides. The surviving portion of the body is rectangular in cross-section with a hole in the centre, which is all that remains of the socket. All surfaces have a shiny green patina, which is missing in a few places. Traces of patination can also been found on the break.

The mouth of the axe is sub square in plan with rounded corners, and on the mouth there is evidence of two casting jets, one on each side edge. The mouth, on the outer faces appears to be semi-circular in section and is slightly wider than the body of the axe itself. The surface of the socket is rough and is encrusted. There are also traces of what may be the casting residue. In profile the axe is triangular with a casting seam visible on both sides. There are no traces of a side loop. The body faces are undecorated and are trapezoidal in plan. The cutting edge is slightly convex, but it has the remains of the casting seam along it. The surface of the axe has traces of active corrosion, pitting and a well developed patina, but the majority of the surface is abraded and perhaps over cleaned revealing traces of fresh metal. It measures 57.76mm long, 36.32mm wide, 33.79mm thick and weighs 110.2g. The depth of the socket is 40.96mm deep.



Peter Reavill and Phil Watson comment the mouth of the axe is unusually wide, and that the shape is oddly 'stubby'. The blade has never been sharpened, and that in combination with the shape suggests it may have been made for use as a votive offering rather than a functional axe. It is probably dated to the late Bronze Age.



As a note a similar shaped axe was recorded from the same parish which has similar dimensions, but does appear to be a functioning axe.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-11-29T00:00:00Z,2014-02-27T00:00:00Z,,,110.2,,,33.79,57.76,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,South West,Gloucestershire,Tewkesbury,Twyning,SO8935,From a paper map,52.01331652,-2.16168564,WAW-1BF878,,WAW-1BF878a.jpg,"Bronze Age socketed axe (plan, profile and plan).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-1BF878a.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/463870.jpg

Peter Reavill comments: This example is best compared with plate 35, Luce Bay (Plate 35) Ipswich, or cat. no. 1157 from Teddington - river Thames - not illustrated - (Rowlands BAR no.31, vol 2 p357) described as having a notch-hilted tang - one rivet hole, and a flat mid rib. Like the Teddington example - I would describe this example as notch-hilted with a single central rivet hole, flat-sectioned blade with a low central mid-rib that extends above the two notched rivet holes.

613593,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 15.3 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (11.5 mm), with traces of a proto stop ridge present. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



It measures 79.4 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.2 mm, width at the butt is 15.3 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 11.5 mm. It weighs 88.2 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

613749,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-2350,-800,"Fragment of a gold ingot or bar which has been folded over and over again from a larger piece of sheet in order to make it thicker and perhaps to beat out any impurities. There are evident layers in section but these have been heat welded together by forging the gold when hot. The fragment has been hammered to thin out the piece at one end and then either snapped or chiselled off in two areas, perhaps to make it into a more rectangular shape, before it was reworked. There are patches of reddish patina, which have also been seen on a strip of gold (2014 T39) that has already undergone X-ray fluorescence analysis, at the British Museum, which indicated a surface composition of 86-88% gold, 11-13% silver and less than 1% copper which is most consistent with a Bronze Age attribution (report by Susan La Niece).



There are also similar hammered bar fragments that have been found in Bronze Age hoards such as the hoard from Cirencester, Gloucestershire (2004 T416) illustrated in the Treasure Annual Report 2004 on pages 232-3, Fig.17.3 & 17.5 and dated on page 26 to c.1300-1100 BC.



Although similar examples have been found in Bronze Age hoards it is not possible to assign the bar fragment to particular period or cultural context, as it is an undiagnostic fragment (Gill Varndell pers comm).",,3,Gold,,Returned landowner after being declared not Treasure,Metal detector,2014-04-11T23:00:00Z,,2014T279,,10.34,,,2,30.7,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Sennen,SW3625,From finder,50.06638079,-5.69046403,CORN-ECECE2,,April14finz061.JPG,bar fragment (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/April14finz061.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/466456.jpg

614093,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A copper-alloy flanged palstave with slight central rib. The blade is flared and the extreme edge and corners are missing due to damage and corrosion.



The palstave weighs 459.73g in its present condition. It has a length of 155.0mm, width of 25.1mm that increases to the maximum (but incomplete due to damage) width across the flaring blade of 64.0mm and maximum thickness of 25.8mm. See blue lines on the annotated image.



The artefact has a single shield shaped decoration positioned below the fused stop, and a subtle lateral single mid-rib below the shield. The cast side flanges are fused to the stop ridge and do not continue beyond the stop ridge. The blade is a crescentic or splayed fan shape. Some of these features are obscured from view by the presence of a concretion product that is present within the depressed areas to either side of and also covering the stop. See yellow dashed lines on the annotated image. Use wear is present on the blade.



Discussion: This form of axe fits into the primary, or early phase, palstaves being specifically of group III c.1500-1300 BC, which corresponds with Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - and with Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.

616207,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age gold bracelet fragment, 45 mm long 11mm wide and 1mm thick. The object is in fair condition and weighs 13.95 grams. The object consists of a solid sub-circular terminal 9.5mm long and 8mm wide. Below this the object has a rectangular form which widens and flattens sharply out to a terminal which appears to have been broken, as though ripped. The fragment begins with a width of 8mm and widens and flattens to 11mm where it has broken. The underside of the shaft is concave, which is most pronounced near the terminal and its upper side remains slightly rounded.



Discussion: The object is very similar to NMGW-E48854 and PAS-B9D6E5 both dated to the Late Bronze Age. Similar bracelets, and their wider context, are discussed by Eogan (1994, 80-108).","As the object is made of gold and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.

616493,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Cast copper alloy blade from a flat axe, trapezoidal in plan with a splayed crescent-shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges, and in section, at the broken butt end, it is rectangular. The blade is flaring to the edge and the blade facet is bevelled from hammering. The long side-edges of the axe are slightly flanged. The broken edge would have continued to taper towards the butt end. The blade edge is uneven with perpendicular nicks across the edge which show that it was used in antiquity. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, and the surface is not very corroded or pitted, with a few marks and strikes such as a linear shallow groove on one side, caused by damage prior to deposition (Laura Ratcliffe pers comm). There is also a circular depression that has been caused by a gas bubble forming when the axe was cast.



The length is 64 mm, the width of broken end is 39 mm and the width of the blade is 66 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 9.5 mm and the thickness of the blade edge is 4 mm.



Similar flat axes on the database can be seen in DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-3324F7, LANCUM-6507C2 and LVPL-851560.



Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe on page 400, Plate 1, No.6, from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall, and broad Migdale type flat axes from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall and Hemyock and Kentisbeare in Devon, on pages 418, 443 & 446, Plates 12, 31 & 33, Nos.98c, 243 & 259, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

In plan the spearhead is an elongated sub-triangle with the blade facets and tip both being abraded. The spear blades cutting edges have been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is oval. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has a light grey/green coloured patina which is incomplete. It measures 50.08mm long, 13.47mm wide, 5.66mm thick and weighs 8.8g.



It is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).

It measures 113.90mm in length, 27.82mm in max.width (across the base of the blade), 23.13mm in max.thickness and diameter (at the open end of the socket) and with a socket depth at least 87mm.

The blade has a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib (extending from a conical socket). It is unclear how far beyond the depth of at least 87mm the socket extends as traces of wood are apparent in the socket. The line of the blade is smoothly curving and angles a little more sharply at the tip. Peter Reavill (FLO, Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments that this example is on the cusp of being 'stumpy', which Ehrenburg defines as being less than 100mm in length and having a width 1/3 their length (pers.comm.

Discussion



The small area from which these objects were recovered and the presence of fragments within the socket of axe head No. 4 clearly suggests that these objects were deposited together as a hoard of prehistoric metalwork. The finds appear to represent a hoard of Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800/700 cal BC) metal in a fragmentary condition, often referred to as a 'founders' hoard'. It is not been possible to assign the axes to more particular typological grouping because of their fragmentary condition but it may be possible to do so in the course of future study.","Conclusions



The objects (No. 1-6) represent a single find of prehistoric base metal. The find therefore qualifies as belonging to a grouping of at least two prehistoric base-metal objects and, therefore, as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2014-03-01T00:00:00Z,2014-03-30T23:00:00Z,2014T364,,,,,,,6,Erica Darch,Erica Darch,Eastern,Norfolk,South Norfolk,Runhall,TG0608,Generated from computer mapping software,52.63064311,1.04251108,NMS-7517F1,,59739_7517F1_BA_Hoard_1and4.jpg,Bronze Age axe head,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edarch/59739_7517F1_BA_Hoard_1and4.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/470325.jpg

The handle of the axe is no longer present due to a break. The object has side flanges which are highest at the break and then become lower towards the blade. 15.5mm from the break, there are a series of ridges visible on both sides of the object. These extend towards the blade and stop just beyond the termination of the side flanges. The blade flattens and widens from the ridges to a maximum width of 64.84 mm. There is a little bit of damage to one side of the blade tip.



The blade is in quite good condition aside from the missing section. There is a fairly even brown patina with small sections of more active green corrosion.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,,,,25.28,86.67,1,Lauren Proctor,Lauren Proctor,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Hambleton,Well,SE2681,Centred on parish,54.22406455,-1.60271879,DUR-863704,,DUR-863704.jpg,DUR-863704: Bronze Age axhead,Durham County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/a8622912/DUR-863704.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/470315.jpg

The axehead is incomplete and broken into two pieces, with loss due to the break.



The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly convex expanding sides and a very slightly curved cutting edge. In profile the blade is triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The break, which occurs just above the stop ridge, is H-shaped in cross-section and measures 26.18x18.15mm.


The butt-end of the axehead is sub-rectangular in plan, tapering towards the butt, and sub-triangular in profile. On both faces, high flanges rise to form the stop ridge (max.19.21mm high). Between these flanges is a vey thin septum, on one face of which is a small lump of metal, probably a product of corrosion.



The palstave retains some of its original smooth dark patina but the majority of the surface is corroded and now a bright green colour with some patches of red-brown. At the break, in both halves, air bubbles are visible in the metal, perhaps weakening it at this point.


With the two pieces fitted together the axehead measures 147.75mm in length. At the widest point, the cutting edge, it measures 47.48mm and at the thickest, the stop ridge, it measures 24.1mm. It weighs 306g.

This spearhead fits into the final phases of the Late Bronze Age specifically that associated with the Taunton/Wilburton - Ewart Park industrial phase, circa 1200 - 800 BC. Davis (2017) dates this type, 'generic' pegged, Davis Group 11, to the Late Bronze Age, 1100 – 800 BC.



The spearhead comprises a leaf shaped blade with a chamfered edge and two circular peg holes on both sides of the socket which are positioned in the upper portion in line with the blade. The socket is conical extending into a raised oval sectioned mid-rib that extends to the tip. The blade is leaf shaped having a maximum width in the lower 1/3 of the blade. The blade is not heavily eroded and the blade facet is present in the upper blade as a clearly visible chamfered edge. The tip of the blade is slightly bent and a small crack is present.

Peter Reavill (FLO, Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments that it is interesting to note the rich dark patina on one face and abrasion corrosion on the upper which suggests that it was placed below the plough soil or at the junction between the natural and the plough zone. The tip is deliberately bent - most likely in antiquity as there doesn't seem to be loss of patina on the bend - which there would be if it were more recent.

628395,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"This is a complete and small penannular ring (or 'hair-ring') decorated with gold foil and a silvery gold inlayed strip. It appears that the gold foil was wrapped around a copper core, and around this, in continuous spiral fashion a silvery gold strip was inlayed, to provide a striped colour effect. The stripes are wide, with four silvery gold inlayed stripes and five gold foil stripes evident around the ring. The terminals are flat-ended and not expanded, 1.3mm apart on the interior side and 2.7mm apart on the exterior side. Careful examination of the terminals shows the folded over gold foil, slightly detaching from the core beneath. In addition, a small piece of gold foil has also slightly detached from the interior surface, opposite the terminals. Slight compression tension lines, at right angles to the ring in plan, are evident in the surface on the interior face, suggesting that the ring may have been formed after the gold foil had been applied to a straight circular-sectioned copper rod. On one outer surface, there is an area of damage (6mm long by 3mm wide), where the gold foil and silvery gold strip are missing, revealing the exposed green copper core beneath. The surface of the silvery gold strip is noticeably more pitted than the gold foil. There are small nicks and scratches over the whole surface of the ring.","Discussion (by Adam Gwilt)



This penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple 'hair-rings' of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, 'hair-rings' have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal BC and 1373-1019 cal BC respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8 ). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).



'Hair-rings' are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O'Connor et al 2008; DCMS 2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (Eluère 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O'Connor et al 2008). This is the sixth known example from Wales, with examples known from Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, 'Carmarthenshire', Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 & 15).



The complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 & Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.



A search of the Heritage Environment Record for the locality did not reveal any known archaeological sites or contemporary artefacts finds within the field where the find was made. However, an Early Bronze Age cemetery is known at Somerset Farm Northwest, a few hundred metres from the find spot (PRN Nos. 00412s; 00413s; 03824s). An undated, but probably Medieval to post-Medieval holy well with two foci (PRN Nos. 03720s; 03721s) and linked to a watercourse and nearby Medieval chapel (PRN 00422s) is also known within a few hundred metres of the find. An undated burial is also known to have been found in the vicinity of the chapel in 1861 (PRN No. 00414s). While not directly contemporary with the penannular ring, an earlier burial focus could possibly have influenced the location of this find and burial context. Though the holy well is much later in date, the spring head and watercourse could also have been a significant landscape location during the Middle to Late Bronze Age.

Dimensions: length 98.1mm; blade width 56.1mm; external mouth dimensions 50.1 by 39.6mm; internal mouth dimensions 32.1 by 25.6mm; depth of socket approx. 64mm; width body below loop 36.7mm; dimensions projecting runner stubs (1) 7.9 by 2.3mm; height 0.5mm; (2) 8.6 by2.8mm; height 0.1mm; (3) 7.7 by 2.6mm; height 0.1mm; dimensions negative runner scar (4) 6.4 by 2.7mm; weight 270.0g



A complete bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides with splaying of the blade edge. The loop is high and narrow, descending from the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the runners spaced approximately 90 degrees apart, although slightly offset, rather than centrally placed along each side. Three of the runners are projecting stubs, while the other is visible as a negative scar. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are oval in plan. Three longitudinal, prominent and convergent ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. On the outer non-loop side there is a slight mismatch in the mould pairing, one side of the mould slightly wider than the other. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. Striations parallel with the curved blade edge indicate it was sharpened for use. Patches of blue corrosion products on both faces suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. The axe has large areas of black patination on the upper surfaces, while the blade end and bevel has a grey-green patination



2. South Wales Type ribbed socketed axe



Dimensions: length 101.5mm; blade width 55.8mm; external mouth dimensions 51.0 by 41.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 33.9 by 28.5mm; depth of socket approx. 74mm; width body below loop 38.9mm; dimensions projecting runner stubs (1) 8.4 by 4.7mm; height 0.3mm; (2) 7.8 by 4.3mm; height 0.2mm; (3) 9.3 by 4.9mm; height 3.0mm; (4) 10.5 by 4.0mm; height 1.5mm; weight 314.6g.



A complete bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has straight and slightly divergent sides with pronounced splaying and recurving of the blade edge. The loop is high and narrow, descending from the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the runners approximately 90 degrees apart. All four runners are projecting stubs. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are oval in plan. Three longitudinal and slightly convergent ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face and the face sides are defined and angular. The ribs are not continuous or well defined, suggesting the axe was cast in a re-used stone mould. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. There is a slight casting flaw, indicated by a projecting linear ridge extending from the underside of the loop on the side surface of the axe. Hammer facets are visible on the upper blade bevel, while striations parallel with the markedly curved blade edge, indicating that the axe was prepared and sharpened for use. On the upper blade surfaces, the axe has a black patination, while at the blade end, the axe has a grey-green patination, with an area of bronze metal showing through on one blade bevel. A small organic sample, possibly remnant wood, was retrieved from the socket of the axe, when the soil was removed from the axe's socket in the archaeological conservation laboratory (MD).



3. South Wales Type ribbed socketed axe (found associated with blade fragment 9)



Dimensions: length 105.1mm; blade width 53.1mm; external mouth dimensions 54.6 by 45.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 36.0 by 32.2mm; depth of socket approx. 75mm; width body below loop 41.3mm; dimensions of projecting runner stubs (1) 9.3 by 3.7mm; height 1.0mm; (2) 7.8 by 2.9mm; height 0.1mm; weight 311.0g.



A complete bronze socketed axe with damage and splitting of the mouth and down the non loop side, with further slight cracking on the mouth. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has near straight and slightly divergent sides with little splaying at the blade end. The loop is high and narrow, descending from the mouth moulding. Two projecting runner stubs are visible at 90 degree angles from each other, suggesting the axe had a four runner casting technology, even though two of the runners are no longer visible. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in plan. Three longitudinal and slightly convergent ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. The ribs are discontinuous on one face, suggesting the axe was cast in a re-used stone mould. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. Some mismatching of the mould halves is evident, with the sides of the loop misaligned and also a misalignment down the non-loop side of the axe, making one side stand proud of the other. In two places immediately below the mouth moulding, and in one place on an upper face, there are small holes in the axe wall, indicating further casting imperfections. Hammer facets are visible on the upper blade bevel on one side, while striations on both sides parallel with the blade edge indicate that the axe was sharpened for use. The axe has a grey-green patination, except on the blade bevels which have a lighter green patination.



4. South Wales Variant Type ribbed socketed axe



Dimensions: length 93.7mm; surviving blade width 40.2mm; external mouth dimensions 39.8 by 31.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 27.5 by 20.5mm; depth of socket approx. 67mm; width body below loop 32.1mm; weight 223.1g.



A near complete slender, bronze socketed axe, with damage to part of the blade edge. The axe has a deep mouth moulding, verging on a collar, and a sub-rectangular cross-section. The axe has near straight but slightly divergent sides with only very slight splaying at the blade end. The loop is narrow, but low, descending from the underside of the mouth moulding. There are no runner stubs or scars around the mouth. Small amounts of projecting excess metal are found around the inner rim of the mouth and at the joining points between the outer mould pairing. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in plan. Three longitudinal and parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. These are prominent and well-defined. The casting seams are narrow, projecting and blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. The surfaces have a few small vesicles or hollows on upper faces, slight surface casting imperfections. There are striations on the blade bevels running parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened for use. The axe has a grey green patination, with bronze metal showing though on one lower face, blade bevels and on the ribs. A small organic sample, possibly remnant wood, was retrieved from the socket of the axe, when the soil was removed from the axe's socket in the archaeological conservation laboratory (MD).



5. Croxton Type ribbed socketed axe (fragment 11 is wedged in the axe socket)



Dimensions: surviving length 103.7mm; blade width 54.9mm; external mouth dimensions 48.2 by 41.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 32.8 by 28.3mm; depth of socket approx. 76mm; width body below loop 41.5mm; combined weight (with fragment 11) 303.2g.



A near complete bronze socketed axe, with a damaged blade edge. The axe has a deep and near flat, onset collar, with no marked flaring of the mouth. The axe is oval in cross section with rounded face edges. The axe has straight and slightly divergent sides, before flaring outwards at the deep blade bevel, though without any recurving of the blade edge. The loop is relatively wide and placed low, descending from the underside of the deep collar. Projecting, but possibly filed down, metal excess is found around the inner rim of the mouth and at the joining points between the mould halves. There are no runner stubs or scars around the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are oval in plan. Three longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the underside of the collar. The casting seams are prominent but blunted, suggesting hammering or partial filing of the excess after casting. There are small vesicles in the surface on one face and on one side of the mouth rim of the axe, which are slight surface casting imperfections. On one face, hammer marks are visible on the upper blade bevel. Striations parallel to the blade edge indicate that this axe was sharpened for use. The axe has a light grey green patination on one side, grading to a darker grey green on the other. Immediately beneath the onset collar, on one face, is a small patch of blue surface corrosion product, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. At the base of the socket of the axe, is wedged a mouth fragment of another socketed axe (number 11, below), preventing an accurate weight for this complete axe to be established.



6. Croxton Type ribbed socketed axe (fragment 10 is wedged in the axe socket)



Dimensions: length 116.8mm; blade width 51.5mm; external mouth dimensions 45.4 by 38.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 34.6 by 28.1mm; depth of socket approx. 73mm; width body below loop 40.3mm; dimensions of projecting runner stub 10.9 by 3.4mm, height 1mm; combined weight (with fragment 10) 434.2g.



A complete slender and heavy bronze socketed axe with slight damage to one side of the blade edge. The axe has a deep but ill-defined collar, with no marked flaring at the mouth. The axe is sub-rectangular to hexagonal in cross-section with rounded face edges. There is slight angling and narrowing from the side casting-seams to the face edges, giving a slightly hexagonal cross-section to the axe. The axe has slightly concave sides, diverging and flaring slightly towards the blade end. Although there is no marked recurving of the blade edge, the blade bevel flares outward slightly. The loop is relatively wide and placed low, descending from the underside of the deep but ill-defined collar. Around the inner rim of the mouth and at the joining points between the mould halves, there is slight excess projecting metal, which does not look to have been filed or hammered down. A distinct widening of excess metal on an inner face may indicate the location of a single visible runner stub. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in form. Three longitudinal ribs descend down both faces of the axe. Unusually, the ribs project above the collar edge and into the lower collar zone, rather than emerging from the underside of the collar. On one face the three ribs are slightly convergent down the blade face, but on the other face there is a convex form with 'bulging' outwards in the middle areas of the ribs. The casting seams are prominent but blunted, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. Hammer marks and longitudinal striations are visible on the upper blade surfaces, while the blade bevels have striations parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the blade was prepared and sharpened for use. On one face edge, on the non-loop side, there are repeated blunt dent marks 2-3mm long and 10.5-1mm wide, in parallel sequence and at right angles to the side of the axe. A few further and similar dent marks are visible cross-cutting through the descending ribs on the same axe face. The axe has a dark grey patination on the mouth and upper end, while bronze metal is revealed over most areas of the lower and blade end. At the base of the socket of the axe, is wedged a side and face fragment from a mid-section of another socketed axe (number 10 below), preventing an accurate weight for this complete axe to be established.



7. Breiddin Type (Southern English ribbed - Class B4 / Welby Type) ribbed socketed axe



Dimensions: length 84.6mm; blade width 45.4mm; external mouth dimensions 39.5 by 37.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 28.2 by25.5mm; depth of socket approx. 67mm; width body below loop 30.1mm; weight 168.4g.



A complete small and slender bronze socketed axe with a swollen and everted mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped cross-section. The sides of the axe are straight but divergent with significant widening and recurving at the blade end. The loop is wide and low placed, descending from a lower horizontal moulding. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in form and the mouth is almost as deep as it is wide. The rim of the mouth is rounded and worn, with no clear runner stubs identifiable. Three longitudinal ribs descend from the underside of the mouth moulding, around one third of the length of each face. The ribs, like the mouth moulding are poorly defined and are narrowly spaced. On one face the ribs are parallel, while on the other, they are slightly divergent. The casting seams, though visible, appear to have been carefully and neatly hammered or filed down. On the loop side, around the upper point of insertion of the loop, there is a curving hole in the axe wall, around 13-14mm long and 3-4mm wide, indicating a casting flaw. The upper blade bevel has been heavily hammered, with hammer marks creating marked flattening and tapering. Striations both parallel with the blade edge and at right angles to the blade indicate that the axe was sharpened for use. The blade edge is markedly deep and curved, with slight damage on the loop side. The blade edge is asymmetric in shape, with lower and more pronounced recurving on the loop side, suggesting long-usage and repeated re-working and sharpening of the blade. Overall, the axe has a grey green patination, although on the upper blade and mouth end, there are patches of black patination, while on the blade bevel, the patina is light grey-green. On one face and the loop side are areas of green and dark blue concretions, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial.



8. Late Palstave of Type Isleham -ribbed form



Dimensions: surviving length 145.2mm; surviving blade width 37.8mm; surviving blade length approx. 82mm; surviving length of butt to stop approx. 59mm; width of butt at break 21.8mm; body width below loop 22.0mm; maximum thickness at stop 32.1mm; stop heights (1) approx.11mm; (2) approx. 10mm; surviving weight 354.7g.



A near complete, slender bronze palstave with a narrow blade. The palstave has a broken butt end and damage to the blade edge. The palstave widens very slightly from the butt end towards the stop, with a nipped-in waist under the stop. The blade sides are slightly concave and divergent, with slight flaring at the blade edge but no recurving of the blade evident. The stop is sub-rectangular and high, projecting in exaggerated fashion at near right angles to the axis in side view. On one face, there is a slight casting flaw where the stop does not project to full height. This shows as a central 'stepped shallowing' of the stop along a 10mm length, and by approximately 2-3mm in height. The flanges are convex in shape, meeting the septum approximately 17mm from the broken butt end. Descending from the stop on each face are three longitudinal and parallel ribs. These are short, extending only 20-22mm down the upper blade faces. Unusually, on each septum surface, there are also two longitudinal and parallel ribs, running parallel with the long axis. These extend from the stop approximately 43mm on one face, and approximately 31mm on the other, before being concealed by a corrosion patch. The casting flashes appear to have been carefully trimmed. Along each side, at the blade end, and below the waisting, slight faceting is visible either side of the central casting seam, 2.5-3.5mm from, and running parallel with the face edges. The loop is broad, one arm above and the other below the level of the stop. Four facets have been shaped onto this, parallel with the loop axis, giving a wide central face, with one wide, then one narrow facet to either side. There are striations running parallel to the blade edges, indicating that the palstave was sharpened for use. The palstave has a dark grey green patina over most areas, with a light grey-green blade bevel and small areas of light green corrosion on the stop, flange and butt end. On one upper blade face and septum, there are areas of green and dark blue concretion, suggesting that the palstave may have been burnt immediately before burial. The break on the butt of the palstave is not corroded but appears evenly covered with soil, suggesting the damage does not relate to the removal of the object from the ground, but may have occurred when a plough clipped the top of the implement at some time during the post-medieval period.



9. Socketed axe blade fragment - not diagnostic (associated with socketed axe 3)



Dimensions: surviving length 42.0mm; blade width 54.8mm; width at break 49.6mm; thickness at break 15.1mm; distance base of socket to blade edge 29.5mm; surviving depth of socket 12.5mm; surviving weight 109.5g.



Blade end fragment of a bronze socketed axe. The sides of the axe are divergent, with almost no flaring at the blade end and no recurving of the blade evident. The axes appears to have had a rectangular cross-section. The casting seams are prominent but blunted, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. There are striations, both parallel and at right angles to the blade edge, visible on the blade bevel suggesting it was sharpened for use. Slight indentations on the faces near to the break may be casting imperfections. The blade fragment has a grey patination, with areas of bronze showing through in places. Near the break and in the socket interior there are green corrosion patches, while on one face there are patches of dark blue corrosion, suggesting that this fragment may have been burnt immediately before burial.



10. Socketed axe side and mid blade face fragment - not diagnostic (wedged inside socketed axe number 6)



Dimensions: surviving length approximately 32mm; surviving thickness approx. 13mm; surviving width - less than 51mm; combined weight (with axe 6) 434.2g.



Side and face fragment from the mid section of a bronze socketed axe, securely wedged inside the socket of axe 6. The axe appears to have had a rectangular cross-section. The casting seam is prominent but blunted, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. It is not possible to determine whether the axe was plain or ribbed. The axe has a dark grey patination, with bronze showing on the casting seam and face edge.



11. Socketed axe mouth fragment - not diagnostic (wedged inside socketed axe number 5)



Dimensions: surviving length - less than 46mm; surviving width at mouth approx 23mm; surviving thickness at mouth approx. 13mm; combined weight (with axe 5) 303.2g.



Mouth, upper face and side fragment from a bronze socketed axe, securely wedged inside the socket of axe 5. The exterior outline of the mouth appears sub-rectangular, while the interior outline appears oval in shape. No runner stubs and no excess metal are visible on the surviving rim surface. It is not possible to determine whether the axe was plain or ribbed. The axe has a dark grey surface patination.",,3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2012-03-31T23:00:00Z,,2012TW7,,,,,,,11,Mark Lodwick,Adam Gwilt,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Colwinston,SS9375,GPS (From FLO),51.4638242,-3.54167165,NMGW-CD2C58,,Colwinston.jpg,Late Bronze Age Hoard,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Colwinston.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/477321.jpg
628511,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-2150,410,"Miniature axe or axe-chisel of Bronze age to Roman date (2150 BC- 410 AD). The object is similar to solid flat axes with a tapering blade, resembling a miniature version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads. The sides are slightly curved and the blades cutting edge has suffered heavy corrosion. 



The object has a heavily pitted patina.



The broad date range has been given due to the form of the object most closely resembling early Bronze age axe heads, however there are numerous examples of Roman votive deposition of such minature axe heads.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,28.3,,,5.33,59.01,1,Miss Ellie Cox,Miss Ellie Cox,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Hambleton,Thormanby,SE4875,From finder,54.16856101,-1.26626827,YORYM-CE8933,,YORYM-CE8933.jpg,Miniature Axe Head ,Durham County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ellie/YORYM-CE8933.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/477343.jpg
628788,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-950,-750,"A fragment of Late Bronze Age socketed axehead, consisting of the cutting edge only and broken just above the start of the socket. It measures 33.54mm in length, 51.46mm in max.width, 11.42mm in max.thickness and weighs 60.51g.

The cutting edge is expanded and relatively undamaged, with just some patination-loss at the very edge. The casting flash is not visible, and the side are faceted, giving an eight-sided cross-section at the break.

The patina is a shiny dark green in colour with fine scratches across the surface, some apparently recent damage and showing a silvery surface beneath.

The depth of the socket at the break is 2.14mm and the break measures 35.29x11.42mm. In profile, the fragment is triangular in shape.

The socketed axehead probably belongs to the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park phase of metalworking, c.950-750 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-12-01T00:00:00Z,,,,60.51,,,11.42,33.54,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South East,Hampshire,Winchester,Droxford,SU5818,GPS (from the finder),50.95851646,-1.17555844,HAMP-E416A3,,HAMP-E416A3.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed axehead,Winchester Museums Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-E416A3.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/477496.jpg
628877,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"A cast copper-alloy spearhead of Middle-Late Bronze Age date, c. 1500-800 BC.



The spearhead is largely complete, with a blade indicating a long uselife and a complete socket with only minor chipping around the edge. The entire head has been cast integral, with a conical socket retaining lozenge-shaped sideloops near the base of the socket. No flashmarks are visible.



The blade was originally 'leaf-shaped', with angular shoulders, but the blades on each side of the head have been repeatedly sharpened over the course of its life, reducing the size of the blade considerably. The socket extends into the base of the blade, with a well-defined rib emerging from the socket and running the length of the blade, with the rib also having been filed with the edges as the blade became reduced in size. The lower blade, near each shoulder probably also appears to have been resharpened.



The surface has an even brown patina with patches of orange corrosion, and occassional small pits of green corrosion.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-11-26T00:00:00Z,2014-02-25T00:00:00Z,,,82.6,,18.25,2.18,105.18,1,Robert Collins,Robert Collins,North East,Northumberland,Northumberland,Whittington,NY9970,Generated from computer mapping software,55.0245348,-2.0171758,NCL-E6C2CE,,NCL-E6C2CE.JPG,NCL-E6C2CE: Bronze Age spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rcollins/NCL-E6C2CE.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/477572.jpg

632319,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1000,-600,"Fragment of a late Bronze Age copper alloy sword of Ewart Park-type (circa 1000-800 BC). The fragment comprises most of the handle. It has marginal ribs running down its edges and two circular perforations. One is filled with iron corrosion. This suggests that this fragment might be dated to the cusp between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (c. 600BC). The handle has an expanded, flared terminal, which tapers to a convex-sided grip. The blade-end of the handle is incomplete, but the 'break' is very neat and linear, and possibly suggests that it was intentionally cut in antiquity. The section of the break bears the same mid-green patina with patches of brown staining.



In section, the handle is 'H'-shaped, and when viewed from the side the lips of the 'H' widen towards the middle. The body of the handle thickens at this point also, and a circular rivet hole is located in the centre.



The surface of the object is smooth and has a mid-green patina with patches of brown staining. The sides of the flared terminal both have what appears to be a shallow ridge of casting running along the centre.

633173,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete and corroded Middle Bronze Age copper-alloy Group II palstave (1500-1300 BC). A copper alloy palstave with single mid rib and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On both faces of the blade there is a single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The surface of the blade has traces of hammer marks forming irregular lines across the wide blade facet. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion, but appears to be symmetrical. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam. There is a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. The flange sides are a sub triangle in profile with casting seams. One side, at the junction of the blade and stop there is an integral loop which is has a sub-lozenge section. The void is a sub semi-circle. In plan the septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, whose butt is rectangular with rounded corners. The surface of the palstave a dark brown/green patina which is incomplete and there is a patch of active corrosion at the butt on both faces. The palstave measures 148.82mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.53mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 32.11mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 337.2g.



The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group II type which has a mid rib decoration. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).



Peter Reavill comments that the palstave '...fits within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII and is likely to be part of the Acton Park II metalworking assemblage. This form is very common in the west mids and marches'.

633881,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1700,"A hoard of two Early Bronze Age flat axes, dating from about 2050 BC - 1700 BC, and found in the same hole. One axe is complete and the other is in two pieces and is decorated.



Descriptive catalogue:



1. A copper alloy flat axe which is in two parts; it seems likely that this object has broken while in the ground and the break is not an example of pre-depositional action. The surfaces of the break are covered with comparable patina to the other surfaces of the object and both pieces fit neatly together.



The upper portion of the blade has a damaged butt, which is now uneven with one corner broken off, creating a diagonal butt. The sides widen slightly towards the break, which is approximately halfway between the butt and the cutting-edge. The lower portion of the blade consists of the cutting-edge, which is worn and one blade tip, the other is missing due to old breaks. The rounded nature of the side with the missing blade tip possibly conveys that after the break, the blade was re-sharpened to create a new working cutting-edge.



One face of the axe is flatter than the other, which is slightly convex. One side of the axe is also noticeably thicker than the other, this feature alongside the broken blade tip are possible indicators of how the axe was hafted, with the narrower side forming the lower edge after hafting. One side has been hammered to create slight flanges; this is only visible on the flatter face as this surface is less corroded. This face also has discernible decoration, consisting of straight vertical punched lines ('Rain pattern') on both the upper and lower portions of the blade. It is possible that the other face and the sides of the axe may also have been decorated, however the evidence of this has been lost due to corrosion.



Overall the axe is corroded and is entirely covered with dark brown patina with areas of green and mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion, particularly on one face.



Dimensions:  Max. Length: 106.8 mm, Width at cutting-edge: 51.8 mm, Width at butt: 19.0 mm, Max. Thickness: 10.4 mm; Weight: 172g.



2. A largely complete copper alloy flat axe. The butt is worn and appears to be slightly damaged; with one squared corner remaining. The sides in the upper half are almost parallel, widening gradually in the lower half to form a narrow cutting-edge. There is a slight stop-ridge across the thickest section of the blade, approximately halfway between the butt and the cutting-edge. The sides form slight flanges, creating dished faces.



Both blade tips are missing due to old breaks and the cutting-edge is very worn and corroded. Overall one face is less corroded than the other and both are covered with dark brown patina with small areas of green corrosion, particularly noticeable along the sides of the axe. All surfaces have mounds and pits of corrosion.



Dimensions: Max. Length: 192.2 mm, Max. Width at cutting-edge: 52.0 mm, Max. Width at butt: 23.3 mm, Max. Thickness: 11.9 mm; Weight: 242 g.



Discussion: 



Both the objects are corroded and missing several key diagnostic features, notably the butt and the blade tips of both objects but key diagnostic features are present, particularly the flanged sides and slight stop-ridge visible on flat axe No. 2. Both objects could be attributed to several possible types; Type Glenalla, Falkland or Bandon, these types are very similar and share common features (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61-68), although the size and the protruding blade tip of axe No.1 are consistent with Type Bandon. These types date to Stage IV or V of Needham's (1996) Metalwork Assemblage scheme (c.2050-1700 cal. BC) and are comparable to several axes found in a hoard of five axes from Wold Farm, Willerby, East Yorkshire, several of which are decorated (Burgess & Schmidt 1981, no. 326-8 & 337, pl. 134; Needham et al. 1985, BBAM Series A, no.5; Rohl & Needham 1998, fig.26, 125). The Silsden find falls within a group of Yorkshire flat axe hoards of MA IV/V noted by Needham (1988, fig. 2)



Additional information on context of discovery: 



In subsequent correspondence (between the 3rd and 4th of December 2014) regarding the relative positions of the axes, [the finder (name redacted)] noted that flat axe No. 1 was the first to be recovered, that the 'axes were deep' and that they 'were in direct contact [with] no space between them'. A sketch and description provided shows the two axes placed side by side but 'kind of overlapping', No. 1 over No. 2, with the blades facing in opposite directions.

Fragment of a late Bronze Age socketed axe. Approximatly one-third of the axe remains, with the surviving third being the blade-end. The blade is flared, and one bale tip survives. The blade narrows to a rectangular hollow shaft. The section of the shaft shares the same mid-brown patina as the exterior, suggesting that it was dismantled in antiquity. The section is smooth in most areas, and appears to have been cut rather than being broken. Small patches of copper corrosion are visible around the section, and at one of the blade tips.

636479,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-800,"A fragment of a copper alloy socketed spearhead dating from the Middle or Late Bronze Age, about 1550 – 800 BC. The object consists of the tip of the spearhead which has a pronounced central spine and a partial broken socket. The object also has partially retained wings which are missing large aspects and those retained are heavily abraded. An insufficient portion of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.



The metal is a dark green with a heavily pitted and corroded patina.

636576,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"A Late Bronze Age copper alloy hammer or chisel, dating 1000-700BC. The object is solid cast and roughly cuboidal in shape, tapering from one end to the other. There is a circular socket at the widest end which would have held a wooden or bone handle. The object has a mid-green to mid-brown pattination across the surface and is rather worn, making the edges very rounded.



A similar example with a rectangular shape and circular socket has been recorded on the PAS database (LVPL-89D1D3). Most published examples have sockets that are the same shape as the object itself. The example on the database is Late Bronze Age in date, making it likely that this example is of a similar date.

It appears to be either a very late specimen belonging to the Penard metalwork assemblage of the late Middle Bronze Age (i.e. a transitional palstave) or, more likely, it was part of the Wilburton metalwork assemblage (earlier phase of the Late Bronze Age, i.e. a late palstave). The palstave is complete and the casting seams have been filed down. The length of the axe is 158mm and the internal length of the socket is 67mm. The width of the body below the stop ridge is 18.4mm.The palstave is complete, but has a very pitted, mottled green surface. It looks like it was cast and prepared for use as well as used and subsequently re-sharpened; there are striations towards the edge of the blade. On one side there is a number of scratches between the wings/flanges on the outer surface of the palstave. These may have come from hafting it, but as the scratches look fresh it is more likely that they were plough damage.

The axe measures 101.75mm in length and the blade is 42.25mm across. The length of the septum and socket is 54.85mm. The width across the possible loop is 22.99mm. The weight is 193g. All surfaces, especially the edges, appear worn and very smooth. The casting seams are smooth and the decoration of three short/curved(?) ribs is almost obliterated. There may have been a miscast loop on one of the sides; what is left is a slight, now flattened and abraded bulge in the casting seam. The blade is short and roughly triangular; it appears small for a palstave of this size, but the wear on the surfaces and along the edges suggests that this palstave was of age when deposited or lost, so it may well have been in use for a long time and repeatedly sharpened which would explain the small size of the blade.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2014-09-12T23:00:00Z,,,,193,,,26.55,101.75,1,David W Williams,David W Williams,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,West Hendred,SU4490,From finder,51.60712326,-1.3660316,SUR-94D598,,DSCF4043.JPG,Bronze Age: Palstave axe,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF4043.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/484827.jpg

It now measures 50.4mm in length, 16.25mm wide, 2.85mm thick and weighs 6.76 grams.



The blade is triangular in shape and lenticular in cross-section, with a broad flat midrib. It extends from a flat D-shaped butt-end with central notch (2.2mm thick and 14.65mm wide) to either side of the butt is a broadly triangular notch.



The blade narrows from 4.15mm wide and 1.15mm thick.



Originally this blade may have been a Group IV rapier, possibly of Type Appleby or Type Cornacarrow with an oblong butt, two side notches and - unusually - a single notch at the top. It may have broken and then reworked into a short dagger with triangular blade.

641509,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1001,"Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group III, Low Flanged, Broad Blade form and possibly of Sleaford variant type, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p136)[1].



The palstave is near-complete, missing the part of the loop and with peripheral damage and is comparatively small (at 127.6mm and with a weight of 243.0g). The butt is damaged but was likely to have been moderately straight (with a width of 21.6mm and a thickness of 6.3mm). The sides from the butt to the stop are near-parallel, gently convex (with a maximum width of 23.8mm). The loop is damaged and extends either side of the stop (with a length of 25.3mm, an internal length of 7mm, a surviving height of 8.7mm and a width of 7.1mm). The septum is rounded and the stops are comparatively flat across both their depths and lengths (with a width of 17.0mm and where the axe has a thickness of 27.7mm). The flanges have a larger degree of damage on one face (with a surviving maximum depth of 25mm and a maximum height of 10.3mm). The flanges are curved and end before the butt, reaching their maximum height before the stop. The casting seams are clearly discernible on both sides and have been finished by hammering. There is the suggestion of subtle nick or ridge at the top of the blade sides and the sides are curved, diverging more sharply towards the blade edge. There is faceting across the thicknesses of the blade. The blade edge has been lost, which was moderately curved and slightly expanded (with a blade width of 44.4mm). The faces are decorated with a trident motif and the edges of the faces are ridged. The midrib and ridged edges both continue as far as the blade facet, producing two concave panels on the faces. The surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright green corrosion. The surface has recently been coated in oil.



The palstave is suggested as being of Type Sleaford because of the characteristic panels created between the midrib and flange extensions, this example may be seen as a variant because of the trident decoration. Sleaford palstaves are seen as beginning early in the life of broad blade palstaves with an uncertain longevity (ibid.). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC.

The palstave is near-complete, with some peripheral damage to the blade, butt and flanges (with a length of 172mm and a weight of 445.3g). The butt (with a width of 21.8mm) is now corroded and of uncertain form. The flanges begin a little before the butt and were comparatively high (now damaged on one face), rising to their maximum height just behind the stop (with a maximum surviving height of 35.5mm). One of the flanges has an indentation, probably the result of a casting flaw. The septum (with a thickness of 7.3mm) is gently concave. The sides are straight and near-parallel, slightly divergent as far as the stop (where the palstave has a width of 25.8mm). The stops are near-straight and flat (with a height above the septum of (12.7mm and 12.2mm). The casting seams are discernible on the sides where the surface survives and have been neatly finished. To the front of the stops, the sides are concave and gradually increase in divergence to the blade. The blade is moderately expanded and the blade tips have been damaged (giving the blade a surviving width of 64.4mm). Both faces are decorated with the characteristic 'shield-pattern' (31mm long) defined by a depression and without a moulding. The faces are flat across their widths and most of the length, before curving to the blade but without a discernible blade facet. The surface has a dark brown patina with areas of dark-green surface loss.



The palstave may be seen as significant being of Acton Park type and found 2100m South East from[m1] the eponymous hoard (Savory 1980, no. 262, p 116)[2]. Acton Park palstaves are dated to 'Acton Park 1' with a suggested date in the 16th century BC (Needham 1996, p 133)[3], within Needham's (ibid.) Period 4.

Circumstances of discovery



A fragment from the butt end of a Bronze Age palstave was found by Mr Tyndall Jones on the 1st of May 2014 in the course of metal detecting.



Description



1. A fragment of a cast copper alloy Bronze Age palstave. The section comes from the butt-end/hafted-end of the axe but does not include the butt itself. There are several breaks and patches of corrosion with only two sides presenting the original patina. A casting seam is visible on one side of the fragment.



Measurements: Height: 25mm; Width: 17.5mm; Thickness (max.) 12.3mm; 8.49 mm (min.); Weight: 43.2g



Discussion



A previous discovery of three objects from the same findspot was made in May 2006 and was declared Treasure (Treasure case 2006 T272). The objects from that hoard (an unlooped palstave and two palstave fragments) are consistent with the character of object No. 1. Given that the fragment was found at the same location it can be considered (on the balance of probabilities) to be an addendum to 2006 T272. The fragment is too small to be typologically diagnostic but, if accepted as an addendum to 2006 T272, it may be assigned to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC), specifically the Acton Park phase of c.1500-1400 BC based on the typo-chronology of the unlooped palstave from the earlier find.



Conclusion



This object represents an addendum to Treasure Case 2006 T272 and therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002) by virtue of being part of a find of two or more base metal objects of prehistoric date from the same findspot.","Addendum to 2006 T272

The tip of the blade and some of the socket are missing. The breaks are patinated. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded leaf-shaped blade. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge. The spearhead measures 75.4mm length, has a maximum width of 17.8mm across the base of the blade, and maximum thickness of 13.6mm across the socket. The depth of the socket is 29mm. The spearhead weighs 25.08 grams. The sides of the blades have been much abraded in the soil, loosing most of their shape and also the cutting edges. However, the overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (base to tip) lozenge shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear and is best described as being conical in shape. At the surviving end of the socket it has a diameter of 13.2mm and a thickness of 1.4mm. The string loops are 11mm from the base of the blade and they are oval. The loop has a maximum length of 11mm, width 2.5mm, and thickness of 2.5mm. The internal diameter of the loop measures 3mm x 1.8mm. The cross section is lentoid. Both loops are filled to some extent with green corrosion products. These loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams on either edge of the spear have presumably been trimmed and hammered flat; they are barely visible. The spearhead is a dark green colour with a corroded and lumpy surface. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.

The axe is represented by a blade fragment, broken across both its length and width (with a surviving length of 49.0mm, a surviving width of 44.8mm, a maximum surviving thickness of 6.2mm and a weight of 51.5g). The unbroken side is straight (for a length of 12mm) and is rounded across its thickness (with a maximum thickness of 4.5mm). The surviving blade tip is rounded and somewhat distorted, after which the surviving part of the blade edge is comparatively straight (42.9mm wide). Neither face has a discernible blade facet. One face is convex over its length, while the other is comparatively flat. All of the breakages occurred in antiquity and the fractures extend around the break. The damage on the axe may be consistent with deliberate damage. The surface has a dark-green patina.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The fragment shows no evidence of developed features and it is possible that the axe belongs to the earlier part of the sequence of tin-bronze axes, possibly of Type Migdale or Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1]. Axes of this date belong to Metalwork Assemblages III - IV, dated to c. 2200 - 1800BC.

The butt end has some damage (with a width of 21mm and a thickness of 4.4mm). The sides are slightly divergent to the break (with a maximum width of 24.6mm and a thickness of 6.7mm - 7.3mm). There is the suggestion of a casting seam on one side, although little of the original surface survives. The flanges are beginning to develop above the septum but are shallow and corroded at the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 9.2mm with a height above the septum of 1.3mm). A small number of casting flaws are evident on the fragment. The surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright green surface loss and corrosion.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1] from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.

The sword is fragmentary, represented by a blade fragment, broken at both ends in antiquity (with a surviving length of 22.3mm and a weight of 16.7g). The blade has a midrib (11mm wide and giving a maximum thickness of 8.0mm), flanked on each side by a concave section to the blade edge. The blade edges have been lost but the beginnings of the blade edge facets are evident on both sides (giving the blade a maximum surviving width of 30.0mm). The short blade fragment is flat across its length with no evidence of bending prior to breaking but there are battering scars on the midrib on both faces. The surface has a dark brown patina, preserved over much of the fragment with areas of bright green corrosion



The fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.

643047,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"I am very grateful to John Llywelyn Williams for the following description:



The axe has a mottled green and brownish yellow corroded surface and is most likely made of bronze. Its most notable feature is its small size - with a length from butt to cutting edge of 73.4mm. The axe is well made with a thin rounded butt and the body expanding to form a slightly asymmetric cutting edge with rounded terminations. The sides are rounded and there may be traces of very subdued side flanges - the abraded surfaces making it most difficult to confirm their presence. There is no stop bevel but a slight depressed concavity across the face of the body in a position a third from the butt end is more likely to be a casting imperfection rather than a constructive feature.



The small size of the axe and the uncertainty about the presence of side flanges makes it difficult to place within a classificatory scheme. Its shape has the features of a miniature Migdale type axe but in a preliminary survey of 24 complete axes of this type from Wales, the length of the group varies from 108mm in the smallest example (Swansea, Great Western Railway Station) to 180mm in the largest (Oxwich, Gower), with an average for the series of 142.2mm. An axe of comparable size is the example from Kelsterton, Connah's Quey, Flintshire, but this is classified as a Developed axe of type Aylesford, a group that could accomodate the present specimen if side flanges were to be confirmed. Migdale type axes belong to Early Bronze Age Period 2 (c 2200/2150 - 2050BC), and Aylesford type axes to Post Period 2 (c 2100 - 1050BC). 



The utilitarian use of such small, slender axes is an unknown but debatable issue. A function as a delicate wood working tool could be postulated, but equally compelling would be to claim it as a votive replica of a much larger example. Unfortunately the context is not known, viz the depth at which it was buried, its position and orientation, and whether it was deposited in a pit or in association with any other below ground feature. Diminutive battle axes in stone, and bronze socketed axes are known from later stages in the Mid and Late Bronze Age. 



No analytical study of its composition has been undertaken. Such a study using a non- destructive quantitative technique (XRF) or semi-quantitative (SEM) could be most informative. 



The surface is abraded and some surface detail may have been lost. It would also be advantageous if the object was to receive remedial conservation to stabilize further deterioration from active bronze disease.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,61.7,,,7.3,73.4,1,Roland Flook,Roland Flook,Wales,Gwynedd,Gwynedd,Bontnewydd,SH4659,Generated from computer mapping software,53.10590198,-4.3019175,GAT-FE6CD4,,PAS2014-20-001 013.jpg,Bronze Age Axe (side A),Gwynedd Archaeological Trust ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rflook/PAS2014-20-001 013.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/488438.jpg
643112,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-650,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe fragment of uncertain type



The axe fragment is a mouth fragment, probably from the unlooped side (with a surviving length of 35.4mm, a surviving width of 28.6mm, a surviving depth of 9.0mm and a weight of 19.0g). The top of the mouth (with a thickness of 5.4mm - 6.0mm) is corroded but a raised area is likely to represent the casting runner stub. The casting seam is evident running down the middle part of the side, from the runner stub and appears to have been prominent, possibly with minimal finishing. There is a weak collar discernible on the side (with a length of 16mm). Above the break, the casting seam is slightly raised and it is possible that it represents the remains of the top of a loop, although it would have been placed comparatively low in relation to the collar. The side fragment is near-straight, slightly concave. The interior of the axe is straight along its length and is curving to the faces on both ends (giving an internal width of approximately 20mm). The surface is heavily-corroded with a mid-brown patina.



The fragmentary nature and lack of diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Socketed axes generally date from the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1150 BC - 750BC) but may also be of the Llyn Fawr phase (c. 800 - 650BC).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,19,,,6,35.4,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Eardisley,SO2951,From finder,52.15269716,-3.03915768,NMGW-0D2364,,2013.42.2 jpg.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed axe fragment of uncertain type,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.42.2 jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/488533.jpg

The object is sub-rectangular in plan and gently widens towards the blade which has a maximum width of 36.05 mm although there is clear damage to the edge of the blade making it very blunt. There is some bevelling on both sides of the object caused by hammering the object. When viewed in profile the object is triangular, with the objects again tapering to a point at the blade. There are clear casting seams on both profiles and on one side there is the base of the loop which has probably broken in antiquity. The axe has a maximum thickness of 28.87 mm. The socket is sub-rectangular and there is damage to the edge with some light green, active corrosion. There is a groove which runs around the object, presumably parallel to the original edge of the socket.

643872,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Early Bronze Age bronze Flat Axe, possibly of Type Migdale (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44)[1], of Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.



The axe is incomplete, missing the butt and with peripheral damage (with a surviving length of 103.3mm and a weight of 264.2g). The break at the butt occurred in antiquity and there is the suggestion of bending towards one of the faces, prior to breaking. The axe is of rectangular section at the break (with a width of 26.4mm and a thickness of 8.3mm), which is flat and at a slight angle to the sides. The sides curve gently towards the blade for most of the length before curving more sharply at the blade. The blade tips are eroded (giving the blade a width of 60.8mm) and the blade edge is comparatively straight, now appearing to be angled although the original blade edge does not survive. The axe has a consistent rectangular section with no surviving evidence for developed features. Both faces are gently convex across their lengths before thinning at the blade.



Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe and was carried out[3] using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), with an Oxford Instruments Inca energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The results show the metal composition is a tin-bronze alloy (with mean readings of copper: 87.08% and tin: 12.27%), with a significant trace of antimony (with a mean reading of 1.25%) and nickel (with a mean reading of 0.24%), but no arsenic. The lack of arsenic as an impurity makes the alloy difficult to fit into Northover's (1980, p 229-243 )[4] Early Bronze Age metal groups but the comparatively high levels of Nickel may suggest that the alloy is closer to his 'G' metal.



The highly-corroded and incomplete state of the axe makes typological identification difficult. However, the lack of any surviving developed features and the simple, curved-sided form to the axe are suggestive of Type Migdale dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.

644185,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1700,"Early Bronze Age Developed flat axe, probably of Type Bandon, as defined Schmidt & Burgess (1981, pp 65-7)[1] and dating to c. 1,900 - 1,700BC



The axe is near-complete with some peripheral damage (with a surviving length of 101.3mm and a weight of 128.4g). The butt is now rounded (with a width of 20.6mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the median bevel (where the axe has a width of 23.9mm), after which the axe sides are concave and sharply divergent to the eroded blade tips. The blade was originally likely to have been comparatively widely expanded (with a maximum surviving blade width of 50.7mm)



The sides are heavily corroded and are convex across their thicknesses'. The flanges survive on both faces (with a surviving height of 1mm). There is a clear straight medial bevel (giving the axe a maximum thickness of 9.7mm, without the flanges and 11.8mm with), surviving on one of the faces (positioned 38.5mm from the butt, 62mm from the blade). The blade face is corroded but appears to have had a facet corresponding to the position where the sides expanded sharply (20mm from the blade edge). The original blade edge is lost but some surface survives on the blade, preserving sharpening striations running along the blade. The surface has a dark-green to brown patina with no trace of applied decoration.



The peripheral damage to the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The clear median bevel, straight sides behind the bevel and expanded blade edge suggest comparatively 'Developed' features on the axe, suggesting Type Bandon (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or a probable Class 4 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming), dating to Periods 3-4 of the Early Bronze Age (c.1950-1500 BC) (Needham 1996). Class 4 axes straddle the boundary between Periods 2 and 3, but this axe can be confidently assigned to Period 3, probably falling within the late Aylesford to Willerby metalworking phases (c.1950-1750 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

644372,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"An incomplete copper alloy flanged axe from the Arreton metalworking phase which dates to the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1700 to 1500 BC.



The blade of the object is present and flares and the blade tips project backwards, one of which is damaged. It has a maximum width of 60.87 mm. The object is broken and so the butt is not present whcih makes the maximum length of the object 84.13 mm. The flanges are prominent and measure 18.33 mm in thickness. The septum thickness is 11.79 mm, and has a maximum width of 22.47 mm including the flanges. There is no stop ridge. The blade facet is clear, and the cutting edge is well preserved and still sharp. There are areas of corrosion across the object, particularly towards the irregular breakage at the top. A similar examples is LANCUM-19A734, or DOR-5D7F46, but with the flanges projecting closer towards the blade.



The axe is of the flanged type which dates to the Arreton (1700 -1500 BC) series. They have characteristically wide blades, and precede the narrower looped Palstaves of later periods.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,191.8,,,17.4,84.13,1,Elliott McDonald,Elliott McDonald,North East,Northumberland,Northumberland,Whittington,NZ0071,,55.03352214,-2.00153443,DUR-A2474C,,DUR-A2474C.jpg,Axe head,Durham County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/a8622912/DUR-A2474C.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/490517.jpg
644526,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"Fragment of a Middle to Late Bronze Age axe of uncertain type, but of Developed Axe or Palstave form. Only a fragment of the butt-end survives. The fragment is rectangular in plan and triangular in section. It has wide flanges on both sides at the break giving the axe an 'H'-shaped section, and these flanges taper to the butt. The break is irregular and well patinated, suggesting that it occured by accident in antiquity. The surface is mottled green and pitted with areas of corrosion.



The length of the axe is 25mm, the width is 26mm. Each flange extends 2mm at the break. The body is 8mm thick.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1] from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.

645421,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2000-1700 BC). The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 20.4 mm (thickness: 4.8 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.1 mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 35.5 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead. The axe is a mid to dark green to brown in colour colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axe measures 81.39 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 35.5 mm, width at the butt is 20.4 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 9.1 mm. It weighs 71.9 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped. These axes fit within metalworking stage IV, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Migdale Variant Biggar (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 18-19. 220 Knapton or 231 Brubster).
