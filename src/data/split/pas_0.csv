The spearhead survives in two pieces, broken across the blade-tang junction. It has a long triangular blade bevelled at the edge, with a rounded midrib and (blade wings with) two distinct steps parallel to the edge of the blade. The central mid-rib is filled, on both sides, with rows of pointille (punched dot) decoration. The tip of the blade is missing and the blade edges are damaged. The junction of the tang and blade is demarcated by an undecorated triangular-shaped facet. The rectangular-sectioned unrivetted tang tapers towards an irregular end which curves slightly upwards. The tang is broken close to the junction with the blade; this is an ancient break. The surface of the spearhead is in poor condition and is partly obscured by corrosion deposits.

It is one of sixteen Type 1B tanged spearheads noted by Davis (2012, 33f.) and is published in his Prahistorische Bronzefunde (Davis 2012, 33, No.29, Plate 3). Two other examples are known from Wales presently (Davis 2012, Nos. 36 and 39). The distribution of tanged spearheads as a whole is concentrated in the south-east of England but examples occur throughout most of Britain and Ireland (Davis 2012, 38; Needham 1979, 7, fig.1.4).

One end of the blade apparently tapers into a tang which is now largely missing. The blade is in poor condition, its tip is bent and its edges are badly damaged and notched. This damage makes it difficult to evaluate whether the apparent tang is a genuine feature or simply a fortuitous break. The blade may possibly be an example of a rare type of Early to Middle Bronze Age knife known as a Class I or 'plantain razor' (Piggott 1946, 122-126, fig.5).

It is not possible to assign this reworked artefact to individual type within the overall group since diagnostic features high up the blade and on the original butt have been lost.

14564,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1200,"Early mid-rib palstave - unlooped with a slight single median rib along each face. The rib is not defined by hollows near the stop, as on some early palstaves. The blade is relatively narrow but has a deeply curved edge. The flanges are leaf-shaped and do not extend along the blade. The stop ridge is undeveloped and is only marginally higher than the surface of the blade. The stop is concave with a shallow 'V' shaped profile. Casting problems have led to damage around the butt resulting in a 'V' shaped intrusion, which should not have effected the usefulness of the axe. The casting seams have been removed but remnants are still visible along both sides. The palstave is complete and in very good condition with a consistent light brown patina. The blade has retained its sharp edge and was probably never extensively used. This form of early palstave dates to the Middle Bronze Age c.1500-1200 BC lying in Needham's metalwork stage 5 (Needham 1997). Butler (1963) has suggested that early mid-ribbed and shield pattern palstaves originate from the initial Acton Park phase of Middle Bronze Age metalworking (Northover, forthcoming p130). The blade shape, low stop ridge and side profile (showing a distinction between flange and blade) may suggest a date towards the end of this form and prior to the introduction of the looped palstave.

The closest parallel is an example from Llanfylin, Gwent (Green, 1985) although this axe is longer and more slender. Green (ibid.) argues the Llanfylin axe is best compared with the Chepstow type of Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and is paralleled with the nearby Coed Llan hoard of Early Palstaves (Williams, 1877).

An example of the Aylesham variant of the Meldreth type of facetted socketed axe cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 206-207, nos.1231-1247B, pl.83.","The distribution of Meldreth type socketed axes extends throughout Britain, Ireland and western Europe (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204). As a type they are defined by: slender facetted bodies (the number of facets varying from six to twelve) and trumpet-shaped collars which curve upwards and outwards (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204-205). The shape of the type's socket varies from circular to square in section and the lower part of the collar is variously defined by one or more mouldings, grooves, overhangs or steps (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 205). The variations in the form of the lower part of the collar are used to sub-divide the type. The Aylsham variation includes those axes which have a horizontal moulding, groove or series of grooves at the base of the trumpet-shaped collar (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 206). A local example of a facetted socketed axe which is also an Aylesham variant of the Meldreth type, albeit with a single groove rather then a horizontal moulding at the base of the collar, is known from St Mellons, Cardiff (Savory 1980, 108, no.189. Fig.24). Survey of the associations of Meldreth type axes from northern Britain suggests that the type dates to the late Wilburton and Ewart Park phases (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 209-211). Southern British associations of the type with Stogursey type axes are consistent with this date (I.e. Mc Neil 1973, 49, nos.34-37; see also Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 210). Recent evaluation of the chronology of the British Bronze Age dates the late Wilburton and Ewart Park phases to the period 950-750 BC (Needham 1996, 136-137, fig.1; Needham et al. 1997, 93-98). The deliberate burring over of the flashing marks on just the collar and inside of the loop on the Penllyn axe is notable. It is uncertain how this was achieved, presumably it was ground down with some form of whetstone or abrasive; however, that it was done at all suggests that the collar was functional and, in addition to the loop, accommodated a binding (cf. Orme and Coles 1983, fig.15; Earwood 1993, fig.128). It is possible that the multiple mouldings around the collars of the Meldreth type axes of the Westow variant (i.e. Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 208, nos.1249-1252, pl.84) are skeumorphic representations of collar bindings of the kind suggested above for the Penllyn axe. The typological, and by extension chronological, significance of this observation is uncertain; a significant number of the Meldreth type axes illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess apparently have had the flashing marks on their collar removed (I.e. Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos.1215, 1217, 1219-1230, 1237, 1240, 1242, 1244, 1246-1248, pls.82-83).",3,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2000-03-01T00:00:00Z,,,,147.7,,35,,107.5,1,Philip MacDonald,Philip MacDonald,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9876,,51.473737,-3.470011,NMGW33,,,,,,,https://bronze-age-index.micropasts.org/img.png

The edges of both the butt and the blade are damaged and the surface of the axe has several spots of corrosion. The sides of the blade more or less evenly curve outwards towards the cutting edge from a point situated about one third along the length of the axe from the butt. The lower halves of both faces of the axe are decorated with a series of incised, longitudinally arranged, irregular, short strokes which form a distinctive 'rain pattern'. Longitudinal striations on both faces of the axe adjacent to the blade edge are probably use-related polish.



Length 131.5mm, width of blade 78mm, width of butt 30.5mm, maximum thickness 11.5mm, weight 346.1 grams.



An example of the Midgale type of Early Bronze Age flat axe, falling within Needham's (1983) Class 3.","The Migdale type has been defined by Schmidt and Burgess as simple, thin-butt, bronze flat axes with more or less evenly curved sides and relatively wide cutting edges, which do not turn out abruptly from the sides (1981, 35). Migdale axes lack features such as median bevels, raised edges and the narrow straight-sided form frequently associated with decoration (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35). Attempts to subdivide the type on the basis of variation in form have been unsuccessful; graphs plotting indices of shape such as length, width and the ratios of the body width at various points along the length of the axe do not show discrete concentrations (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35). The Gwaelod-y-Garth example is a relatively narrow example of the type. Although most Migdale axes are plain the lower halves of both faces of this example are decorated with a series of incised irregular short dashes which form a 'rain pattern' cf. Harbison 1969, 67, fig.3.D3. Similar decoration is present on Migdale axes from Ystradowen, Glamorgan (Savory 1954-56; Savory 1980, 43,100, no.111, fig.17), Oxwich Bay, Gower (Gwilt and Macdonald 2000) and reportedly Montgomeryshire (Savory 1964-66, 192; Savory 1980, 43, 100, no.108, fig.17). As a type Migdale axes are difficult to date with precision. The typological metalworking stage or assemblage which includes Migdale axes has recently been dated from c.2300BC to c.1900BC (Needham 1996, 130, fig.2). Unfortunately, there is little independent evidence for the dating of decorated examples of the Migdale type, although there is some evidence to suggest that they may date to a late phase of the type's vogue (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 58).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2001-02-01T00:00:00Z,,,,346.1,,,11.5,131.5,1,Philip MacDonald,Philip MacDonald,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Llantwit Fardre,ST1084,,51.547689,-3.299328,NMGW3322,,,,,,,https://bronze-age-index.micropasts.org/img.png
14678,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1275,"Middle Bronze Age basal-looped spearhead. Length 220mm and 32mm wide across the widest part of the leaf-shaped blade. The socket, encircled by three lightly engraved lines, is 50mm and 16-17mm in diameter at the mouth where it is approximately circular in cross section; further up, the section is sharply angular. Because part of the wooden shaft remains firmly wedged in place it is not possible to known how far the hollow socket extends. There are two neatly formed loops at the base of the blade, one a little larger and lower than the other. The two halves of the mould have been very slightly misaligned and the thickness of the socket metal varies around its circuit. There is a small blow hole in one side of the spine just above the loops. The weapon is not worn or smoothed by the sea and there are stains on the blade which suggest that it had laid until recently in some peaty soil. It is probable, therefore, that it had been recently eroded from coastal peats.



The metal is in good condition with a fairly uniform matt surface of blue/purple colour; nowhere is the patination shiny, which may be an effect of salt water and sand. The edges of the blade have been sharpened in the middle section in antiquity, creating a slightly ragged, thinner edge; the bottom of the socket has also seen a little damage which may have occurred during use. This spearhead falls within Davis' (2012) Type 8A spearhead (flame-shaped blade, incorporated basal-loops) and can be dated broadly to the Taunton phase (1400-1275 BC) (Davis 2012,133-134). It is recorded in Davis' (2012) corpus: No.741, Pl.45. The spearhead can be paralleled in the Taunton hoard itself and in the Stibbard hoard from Norfolk. In Wales the closest parallel is the very splendid weapon from Nebo near Llanrwst which is twice the length but has the same angular socket and essentially leaf-shaped blade (Bezant Lowe 1912, 47; Ellis Davies 1929, 342). A spearhead from the river at Hay on Wye is of similar date but has a rather more complex section across the blade (Savory 1980, 112, fig.27).","The coastal area of Merioneth on either side of the Maddach has produced quite a number of chance finds of bronze implement over the years (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 109-28). The palstave is the main working tool of the period and there are several of both Middle and Late Bronze Age date; but in addition there are a surprising number of weapons. A spear, now lost, from Barmouth had loops on the socket, so probably belonged to an earlier phase than the Tal y Bont one; those from Llanfrathen and Brithir are without loops and belong to the Late Bronze Age. The famous Cwm Moch hoard contains spears with basal loops but a rather more triangular blade which indicates a date in the Penard phase, about 1200 cal BC. This hoard also contains rapiers, the quintessential Middle Bronze Age weapon, soon to be replaced by the leaf-shaped sword which first appears in this phase. Rapiers are rather rare everywhere, but Merioneth has produced another from the Cwm Moch area. Two fine gold torcs (twisted 'neck rings' but long enough to be used as a belt) have been found, one near Harlech and the other on the slopes of Cadair Idris. At a slightly later date a splendid bronze shield was buried in a bog near Gwern Einion and a rare bronze bucket was similarly offered to the gods at Arthog (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 126-7). Coastal Merioneth may therefore be regarded as a region of wealth and splendour in the Bronze Age. The quantity of material is not especially large, but the quality and interest of the pieces is high.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2000-04-20T23:00:00Z,,,,,,,,220,1,F Lynch,Philip MacDonald,Wales,Gwynedd,Gwynedd,Barmouth,SH6217,From a paper map,52.732976,-4.045221,NMGW3325,,,,,,,https://bronze-age-index.micropasts.org/img.png
14679,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2300,-2050,"Early Bronze Age Flat Axe - probably Class 3.



Dimensions: blade width 57mm, surviving length 86mm, maximum thickness 9.5mm, weight 211.3 grams. 



This axe has slightly concave sides, which diverge gently towards an expanded blade end. The butt of the axe has been broken off in antiquity. There is some evidence that the axe was deliberately damaged; the profile has been slightly bent at the butt end, implying considerable force, and there are linear marks on both butt end surfaces aligned at right angles to the axis of the blade. These would appear to be deliberate blows from a narrow bladed implement, such as another axe. The blade edge is extremely eroded and the axe surface is heavily pock marked, having a green patina, with patches of lighter green carbonate deposit. This may be identified as a bronze flat axe of the Type Migdale/Class 3 belonging to period 2 of the Early Bronze Age (circa 2300 - 2050 cal BC) in Britain (Needham 1983; 1996; Schmidt & Burgess 1981). These are the earliest bronze axes of Britain, which were in use at the same time as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Parallels for this axe, within the National Collection are examples from Usk, Monmouthshire and Whitchurch, Pembrokeshire (Savory 1980, Cat Nos. 106 & 107).","Flat axes are usually found as single finds and separate from settlement and burials of this time. As a consequence, it proves very difficult to date them because of the lack of associations with other material culture and human activity. At present, less than 100 flat axes have been recorded from Wales, spanning a time period from 1500-1900 BC. Therefore each single new find adds significantly to the picture of early metal use here (Gwilt 1999). The probable evidence of deliberate breakage of this axe is interesting, suggesting either breakage prior to recycling and re-smelting or deliberate breakage as part of a ritual involving the burial of the axe within the ground. It is unlikely that a modern plough would have caused such focussed and directional damage to the axe. It is probable that this axe was cast and made in Britain; axes of this shape may be found all over Wales, Scotland and England. In Wales, Bronze Age copper mines have been located and excavated on Anglesey, at the Great Orme, near Llandudno and on Copa Hill Cwmystwyth in mid Wales. However, the earliest radiocarbon dated activity at the Welsh mines belongs to the middle of the Early Bronze Age (circa 1900cal BC), which is after the currency of the Type Migdale flat axe. The earliest copper mining evidence from Northern Europe comes from Ross Island in County Kerry in Western Ireland, with mining occurring between 2500 - 2150BC. However these mines probably supplied ore to make the earliest copper axe types, which are particularly common in Ireland, yet rare in Britain. A mould for making flat axes has been found at Betws-y-Coed, Conwy, showing the technology did exist for flat axe production and casting in Wales, even if the metal source remains speculative.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2000-12-01T00:00:00Z,,,,211.3,,,9.5,86,1,Adam Gwilt,Philip MacDonald,Wales,Bridgend,Bridgend,Cefn Cribwr,SS8781,,51.516584,-3.629929,NMGW3326,,,,,,,https://bronze-age-index.micropasts.org/img.png
14694,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1650,-1500,"This is a small unlooped palstave of slender form without any form of decoration or ribbing on the upper blade surfaces. Well-defined ledge stops, characteristic of palstaves, are present at mid point along the length of the artefact. Pronounced and asymmetric cast flanges rise at the point of the stops and continue to the butt end. Near to the stop, two notches in the flange profile suggest differential wearing in antiquity, possibly caused by a haft binding. On one side of the axe, one flange is markedly higher than the other, making the palstave sit on an angle when placed upside down on a flat surface. The blade edge has been neatly removed in antiquity, by three blows. These have removed the central and lateral parts of the blade surface, giving a triple 'clipped' shape, and removing the blade at the point where it would have splayed outwards. The artefact has a brown patina and a slightly pitted surface. A number of scrapes and gouges on the blade end of the artefact were probably caused by relatively recent plough damage within the ploughsoil. Dimensions: surviving length 120.0mm, surviving blade width 36.5mm, maximum flange width 22.0mm, weight 200.2 grams. This is an early unlooped palstave belonging to the Acton Park 1 phase (Period 4) belonging to the end of the Early Bronze Age. It may be dated, on current available evidence to between 1650-1500BC (Needham 1996). The palstave is a very early type, representing an intermediate stage between earlier haft-flanged axes and subsequent palstaves proper (the flanges typical of the former and the stops typical of the latter). Northover (unpublished manuscript) has grouped these as of 'intermediate type' with parallels known from Ludlow (Shropshire), Abertillery (Blaenau-Gwent) and Whitchurch (Cardiff). The latter two examples are in the National Collection (Savory 1980, Cat. Nos. 129 & 130, Fig.19), the closest being the example from Whitchurch.

41384,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"This record has been updated and reinterpreted 4/5/21 by Peter Reavill with the support of Dr Brendan O'Connor. The original record was made 18 years ago on the original PAS database.





A cast copper alloy short-flanged axehead of Middle Bronze Age date (1600-1250 BC). Unfortunately there is only one view of the axe making the form difficult to be identify specifically to a type or sub-type. The blade is worn and crescentic in shape and the upper blade has a shield pattern directly below the relatively prominent stopridge. This stop ridge is not fused to the side flanges which project slightly beyond the stop and are curled. The butt is squared off with a broken edge. Although the type is difficult to suggest given the presence of a shield pattern it is most likely to be from among the earlier types of flanged axehead, perhaps Cragg Wood dated to the period 1600-1400 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, nos. 462-82) - being attributed to either Acton Park I or Acton Park II metal working assemblages.

The object is a fragment of a possible spearhead. The tip is missing as is the majority of the lower portion. The socket, if there was one, is not visible. In plan the fragment is a sub-triangular shape with a rounded tip and heavily abraded edges. The lower edge is broken, probably quite recently as the patina does not cover this area. In cross section the spearhead is a sub-lozenge shape, however one edge is very abraded. The original existing edge is also slightly more angled forming a shape edge. The patination is heavy and a dark green colour.

Late Bronze Age socketed knife of Thorndon type in good condition. The blade is leaf-shaped, resembling in miniature swords of the period. The blade edge is bevelled on both sides with a slightly concave profile. The socket is oval in section and on the exterior expands at both ends, while the interior is parallel sided. The blade and socket, characteristically for the type, meet at a straight line. There is a circular attachment rivet midway along the socket, the rivet is still in place on one face. Near the rim beneath the handle is a smaller hole, possibly a secondary attempt to secure the handle. On the other face an area of bronze has torn away, the top of the tear corresponds with the secondary hole on the other face and it is a possibility that this tear occurred during the repair. The knife has a brown patination with some of the red-brown soil still adhering to it. There are no visible sharpening striations along the blade.
",Thorndon-type socketed knives were first classified by Hodges (1956) and can be broadly dated to the Ewart Park metalworking phase (c.900-800 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

48833,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1020,-800,"Incomplete ribbed socketed axe of Ewart Park metalworking tradition, dated to 1020-800BC. The axe has lost the mouth, one of the sides and an area of one face. The remainder of the damaged face has been crushed inwards, although it is now difficult to determine if this damage occurred in antiquity. The more complete face demonstrates the remains of two of the three parallel ribs. The mouth and collar of the axe are missing. The loop is also absent, but the remnants of the lower attachment point are evident on the more complete side. The axe would have had an hexagonal body profile, probably with a slightly expanded blade. The casting seam is visible along one side, and appears to have been finished by hammering. The remains of the socket suggest a rounded rectangular profile. The original surface of the axe has been lost, apart from possible small patches of brown-red patination on the incomplete face and in the socket. The surface damage and fragmentary state of the axe make it difficult to assertion the axe type. The ribs and hexagonal body profile suggest a South Wales (or Stogursey) type, of a relatively small example. However, the absence of the mouth and collar moulding make it impossible to be certain.","Socketed axes of a variety of types are prolific in south east Wales as both single and hoarded objects. South Wales axes are the most common, with over 120 examples now known, and have often suffered indicators of deliberate damage such as that seen on the present example. Single, damaged socketed axes are known nearby at Langstone (NMGW162) and Ponthir (PUBLIC-9BD5E6). Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).

Socketed axes of a variety of forms belong to the Ewart Park phase of the British Late Bronze Age (Needham 1981, 32-37). Recently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800BC cal (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2002-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,87,,,19.9,68.7,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Caerphilly,Caerphilly,Rudry,ST2286,,51.567457,-3.126753,NMGW-6D9AD7,,DSCN0434.JPG,Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0434.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5281.jpg

This palstave type is familiarly known as the 'Transitional Palstave', (Smith 1959; Schmidt & Burgess 1981) and is best paralleled in welsh material with the Cammaes hoard and corresponding metalworking tradition. Nortover (forthcoming) has suggested that Cemmaes metalworking is contemporary with the Taunton phase (c.1600-1200BC; Needham et al 1997) in England; although Taunton palstaves are generally of the 'Low-flanged' type, with transitional palstaves generally being of the Penard metalworking stage (c.1400-1000; ibid.) and possibly continuing into the Wilburton metalworking stage (c.1300-1000; ibid.). The palstave has a short butt, which has been damaged in antiquity on one side. This break has occurred through an air bubble in the bronze. The loop is missing, and was placed relatively far back, beginning immediately after the stop. Casting flaws are further evidenced with a hole at the stop on one side. The axe has diverging sides resulting in an expanded crescentic blade edge. The blade has a bevelled edge which begins as the sides significantly diverge. The moulds may have been slightly miss-aligned, resulting in a change of direction in the profile in the sides of the axe. The casting seem on the looped side has not been placed central to the sides. The loss of much of the surface of the axe has made it difficult to decipher the trident design on the faces, the split angular triangular motif against the stop can be made out, but the central rib, can no longer be seen.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2002-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,306.8,,,28.2,114.7,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Newport,Newport,Michaelstone-y-Fedw,ST2384,,51.54961512,-3.11188969,NMGW-71CCA7,,DSCN0519.JPG,Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0519.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5294.jpg

Copper alloy socketed side-looped spearhead.



Incomplete short socketed spearhead with a plain kite-shaped blade and central rib defined by the tapering socket. Only one of the side loops survive, and is comparatively shallow. Approximately half of the socket is missing, probably because of erosion. The base of the socket is also missing, but is unlikely to have been very much lower. Only small areas of the original surface survive and the blade edge has also been eroded. The socket retains the remnants of the wooden shaft, and further shaft fragments were displaced when the spear dried subsequent to recovery.
","The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and elsewhere, and is similar to Savory (1980) Nos 227-230. This spearhead has been classified by Davis (2012, 56, No.142) within his 4A (Plain Kite Blade, Long) sub-class. Davis (2012, 55-56) lists 21 examples of this sub-class (incl. the present example), though the Sandfields example is one of only two examples that has side loops close to the base of the socket; the other is from Craigielee, Perth (Davis 2012, No.138). Group 4, as a whole, lacks homogeneity in terms of overall form, and the distribution in Britain is typically more northern, with five findspots known from Scotland (Davis 2012, 58). The type may have some Irish influence (ibid.). The Sandfields spearhead is the only securely provenanced Group 4 spearhead from Wales, though examples are also known from Cheshire and Herefordshire (Davis 2012, Nos.136, 145). Davis (2012, 56) has dated this group to the Acton Park phase in the early stages of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1600-1450 BC).",3,Copper alloy,Wood,,Metal detector,2002-11-01T00:00:00Z,,,,38.3,,17,,101.6,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Neath Port Talbot,Neath Port Talbot,Sandfields West,SS7390,,51.594488,-3.834842,NMGW-2C36F4,,Dscn1130.jpg,Spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn1130.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5409.jpg

50171,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"
Late Bronze socketed axe fragment of Ewart Park metalworking tradition and possibly of South Wales Type. The axe fragment is heavily corroded, with none of the original external surface surviving. The axe has broken in antiquity, and only the bottom blade part is represented. One face has broken at the base of the socket, while the other face is present for approximately a little over half of its original length. The axe is comparatively small and slender, with the sides gently diverging to the blade. No evidence for a splayed blade survives. The more complete face exhibits the remnants of ribs, and appears to have had four (rather than three) parallel or slightly converging ribs. The casting seam may be discerned on both sides, and considering the degree of surface loss, must have been fairly prominent. The blade edge does not survive. The interior of the socket has much better surface preservation and has patches of black colouring, possibly remnants of tenorite.
","Socketed axes of a variety of types are prolific in south Wales as both single and hoarded objects. South Wales axes are the most common, with over 120 examples now known. Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).

Socketed axes of a variety of forms belong to the Ewart Park phase of the British Late Bronze Age (Needham 1981, 32-37). Recently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800BC cal (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-05-31T23:00:00Z,,,,55.2,,,12.8,52,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Pont-y-Clun,ST0380,From a paper map,51.51057249,-3.39914405,NMGW-E75E26,,Dscn1184.jpg,Socketed axe (inside socket),The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn1184.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5916.jpg

The dirk has a plain ogival shaped blade with a rounded central rib producing a flattened lozenge cross-section.

The butt has corroded to a trapezoidal form, although this should not imply any similarity to the butt when complete. None of the corroded notches around the butt can be positively identified as rivet holes, however it is tempting to see the arc near the top of the dirk as the possible remnants of a rivet hole.

51789,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1700,"Decorated developed flat axe, probably of Class 4E (following Needham forthcoming), corresponding with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) type Scrabo Hill and with Type Ballyvalley (Harbison 1969) in Ireland. Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase. This axe has the general shape of Type Glenalla, being long and narrow, but has the straight and slightly diverging sides characteristic of Type Scrabo Hill. The axe probably had a comparatively straight and thin butt and straight sides which diverge gradually up to a point near the blade corresponding to the beginning of decoration on the face, after which the sides turn out sharply to the expanded crescentic blade edge. The sides are worked up forming low, poorly defined flanges and are decorated with a hammered elliptical design. The faces are flat with a weak, slightly curved median bevel, the position of which approximately corresponds with the edge of the decoration. The blade has one well defined blade facet, and the blade edge has been lost. The decoration is concentrated on the blade and is composed of oblique chiselled regular strokes of 'rain' pattern confined at the top and bottom by two tight rows of opposing diagonals forming a herring-bone motif within a punched dot border, and on the sides by a single column of tight diagonals outside a punched dot column. The diagonal markings edged by punched dots extend up both sides with a single column in the centre, which ends well before the butt. The axe is in good condition with much of the surface surviving on one face, but fairly extensive pitting on the other face.","Axes of this type have a predominantly Irish distribution with a concentration in the northern half of the country (Harbison 1969); Harbison notes 846 Irish examples of Type Ballyvalley in his catalogue (ibid). The axe can be paralleled with an example found near Ballina, Co. Mayo (No 825, ibid.), which has similar decoration and is of similar dimensions, but differs in the fact that the example has two blade facets.



However, Class 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain (Needham 1983). In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known though none with comparable decoration. A 4E axe from Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, is decorated with small strokes in vertical and horizontal bands across the axe faces (Needham 1983, Fig.40.1), while one from Overton, Wrexham (NMGW-4596D8) is described as having a raindrop pattern. The flanges of a 4E axe found at Knighton, Powys (PUBLIC-905653), are decorated with a herringbone pattern.



A smaller, but similarly decorated 4E axe is known from Suffolk, which possessing cable decorated flanges and a panel of incised chevron decoration on both faces below a median bevel (Needham 1983, Fig.39, Sf 32).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-04-30T23:00:00Z,,,,447.8,,,14.1,150.5,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Llanbadrig,SH3692,From a paper map,53.399277,-4.468163,NMGW-6152E8,,DSCN1424.JPG,Bronze Age Developed flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1424.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/7747.jpg

The palstave has a narrow form and is parallel sided at the rear, extending as far as the beginning of the blade. The blade sides gradually diverge to a point corresponding to a blade facet on the face, after which it expands into wide blade producing a deep crescentic blade edge. Remnants of the casting seams are visible on both sides. The butt is concave and the flanges at the rear of the axe are straight as far as immediately before the straight stop. The blade thickness is shallower than the flanges, producing a gradient from the blade to the stop. The stop on one face extends beyond the height of the flanges. The sides of the face on the blade have low flange extensions, which continue as far as the blade facet, as does the single rib on each face.","Dating early palstaves remains problematic, Norhtover (forthcoming) has stated that Group II palstaves belong to the earlier stages of Acton Park (or Acton Park 1), and Needham (1996) argues that no true metalwork assemblage can be defined as Acton Park 1 and groups Acton Park 2 with Taunton in his Period 5 (1500-1150 BC), Needham's (1996) C14 dating of a broad-bladed shield pattern palstave, however, was dated to 1 sigma to 1610-1420 BC (OXA -4651). Northover (forthcoming) notes the composition of some Liswerry palstaves, including Liswerry itself produced signatures consistent with Taunton phase metalworking (c. 1350-1200 BC) The distribution of early midribbed palstaves in Wales and the Marches is generally south eastern in contrast to a mainly northern distribution of shield pattern palstaves.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-05-31T23:00:00Z,,,,371.9,,,33.6,151,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Llanbadrig,SH3692,From a paper map,53.399277,-4.468163,NMGW-61A406,,DSCN1421.JPG,Palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1421.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/7746.jpg

52830,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"The palstave appears to have lost about 20mm from the butt in antiquity, but in other respects is in very fine condition, though beginning to lose small patches of its fine patinated surface, especially around the sharp recurved blade.  The surviving length is 130mm, probably originally 148mm; the width of the blade is 65mm, of the septum 25mm, and the depth of the flanges is 28mm.  The face view has an essentially straight septum and wide blade; the side view a smooth curve from blade to flange.  The ledge stop is approximately square in face view and there is a hollow at the base of the septum on each side.  There is no ‘nick’ at the junction of flange and blade, a design feature of several early palstave types, but here the reminisence of the earlier flanged axe design lies rather in the slight extension of the flanges below the stop.  On both faces there is a rounded swelling below the stop.  This is perhaps a variant of the ""shield pattern' seen on so many Welsh palstaves, but it is not defined by a raised moulding.
     
     The piece has been competently cast and the casting seams have been ground down, but a slight misalignment of the two valves of the mould has meant that a small area on the side has not received the fine polish that is evident on the rest of the surface.  This accident demonstrates the effort that had been made to create the fine dark surface and raises the question of the extent to which particular colour and surface effects might be deliberate.  There is evidence of neat horizontal hammering underlying the polished surface on the blade facet.  The hammer or punch used was rectangular, 5 x 2mm.","It is a particularly interesting piece for two reasons; it belongs to a relatively rare group of early unlooped palstaves which are characteristic of mid-Wales and arguably ancestral to the established palstaves of the influential Acton Park Complex in north Wales; and its exceptionally finely polished black surface raises questions about the possibility of deliberate patination of such pieces.
     
     The closest parallel to this piece is a very slightly larger palstave found in the nineteenth century at Clochfaen near Llangurig (Mont) which has been used to exemplify a sub-group of the early shield pattern palstaves (Williams 1895, 243 no.5; Chitty 1949; Burgess 1964).  It has the appropriate proportions, less clumsy than the true Acton Park type, with a wide splayed blade and narrow smooth flanges seen from the side.  The Clochfaen palstave has a shield moulding on only one face so its absence on the Maerdy example does not preclude its association with the Clochfaen Group.  Other members of the group (now re-named 'Llandderfel' (Northover unpublished catalogue)) are found in Anglesey and Gwynedd (7), Denbighshire/Flintshire (3) and Cheshire/Shropshire/Montgomery (7 + this new one); only 4 have come from Glamorgan and the southern Marches.

The swords have been deliberately broken into fragments so that they can be easily melted down. One fragment appears to have already been subjected to intense heat and is partially melted. 

    
    There are two large pieces of sword blade. Both are lentoidal in section and have a pronounced line along each cutting edge. One fragment measures 100.78mm  by 31.85mm and is a maximum of 6.29mm thick. The other is 104.2mm by 40.44mm and is a maximum of 6.73mm thick. There are two further sword blade fragments. One measures 73mm by 36.25mm and is 5.83mm thick; the other measures 27.15mm by 36.18mm and is 4.97mm thick.

    
    There are also two fragments of sword handles. The larger of the two fragments measures 63.21mm by 37.84mm and is 3.36mm thick. It has marginal ribs running down its edges and two circular perforations. One is filled with iron corrosion. This suggests that at least this fragment can be dated to the cusp between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (c. 600BC). The other sword handle is more corroded. It is similar in shape and measures 32.98mm by 40.57mm and is 4.71mm thick. The circular rivet hole can be seen on the broken edge of the handle.

54030,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1700,"Small developed flat axe or cast-flanged axe, probably of Class 4E (following Needham forthcoming), corresponding with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) type Bandon and with Type Derryniggin (Harbison 1969) in Ireland. Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase. The axe appears to have lost the majority of its original surface, and problems in identifying surface detail are further enhanced by a thick coating of glossy varnish applied by the finder. The butt is thin and rounded and both sides are slightly concave and curve outwards to the blade tips to define an expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The flange facets are comparatively low, and define thin-pointed oval.sides. A stop is now only barely discernible on one face, and is positioned approximately mid way along the axe. Blade facets are evident on both faces. No decoration is discernible on any of the faces or sides.","The axe can be paralleled with a number of similar, but slightly larger axes, found near the findspot (NMGW unpublished records). Within the National Museum of Wales' collections similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750-1600 BC.



Class 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain, with examples similar to the Llandow axe known from Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire (Needham 1983, Ca 8, Ca 10, Li 15/2). In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known. Several are decorated (e.g. Llanbradig, Isle of Anglesey NMGW-6152E8), but the majority are undecorated.

The casting jet is corroded, but displays the remnants of the characteristic four runners used to produce the South Wales Type axe during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age. The upper face of the jet is flat, while the lower face is irregular and concave, with the remnants of the four projections. The jet is of irregular oval shape and does not have a central aperture, it is of a light - mid brown colour with very little of the original surface surviving.","The casting jet was found associated with a ribbed socketed axe blade fragment (NMGWPA 2003.144.1; NMGW-B88605) and is similar in condition and colour to the axe fragment. The four-runner casting technology of the jet may lend further weight to the suggestion that the axe fragment is from a South Wales Type axe. The association of contemporary artefacts suggest the metalwork forms a small hoard deposited during the Late Bronze Age and is therefore likely to constitute Treasure under the revision of the Treasure Act 1996. Four-runner casting jets have recently been identified and recorded in a number of hoard discoveries in South Wales, including the St Nicholas, Cowbridge, and Brigam Farm metalwork hoards.

Complete, but damaged Late Bronze Age plain socketed axe-head. The axe is comparatively long and slender in form. The mouth is somewhat circular, but the socket profile is sub-square and the axe has a sub-rectangular body section. The collar is simple and flared with no mouldings. The mouth-edge surface no longer survives, but the axe was likely to have been cast using a two-runner casting technique. The loop (now broken) is slight and of oval-section, springing from the underside of the collar, and gently arcs back to the side. The sides are straight or slightly concave before they recurve to the blade end. The casting seams are clear on both sides and have been neatly finished, probably by abrasion. The blade end has been damaged, but would have been expanded and curved. Both faces have clear hammered-marks on the lower third of the axe. Sharpening striations running along the blade edge are visible on both faces. One face has many striations running along the length of the axe, but it is unclear if these are deliberate or from antiquity. The axe is in comparatively good condition with a dark green patina, but with areas of damage at the mouth and blade. The top of the axe has a patchy black coating or deposit, possibly tenorite.

The axe is of South Wales (Stogursey) Type and is typical of Ewart Park axe heads found in south east Wales. The axe is comparatively short and squat. The socket is sub-rectangular, within an irregular mouth, clearly showing remnants of all four casting runners. The loop is of lozenge section and begins immediately beneath the simple angled collar moulding. The sides curve gently to a slightly expanded blade, producing a curved blade edge. The casting seams shows signs of finishing, probably by hammering, although they seem unfinished near the top of the axe on the unlooped side. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, which appear high and crisp. The sides of the face have a suggestion of enhancing, possibly to resemble ribs. The blade on the better preserved face shows evidence of hammering and sharpening striations near the blade edge. The blade edge has been lost through damage.","South Wales axes and variants are prolific in south east Wales with over 120 examples now known as single finds and in hoards.

Bracelets of this type and other mid-Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' artefacts are not common finds. These bracelets concentrate in the southern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and West Sussex and examples are also known from Suffolk and Norfolk. Incised decorated bracelets form part of a North European tradition, which has led to the suggestion that the examples from southern England may be imported from northern France, although this theory has been questioned (O'Connor 1980). While some of the known bracelets come from hoards containing items such as torcs, pins, axes, palstaves and other mid-Bronze Age artefacts, no other objects were found in association with this example.

59228,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"Bronze palstave axe dating to the early Middle Bronze Age, and probably of Taunton or Cemmaes metalworking tradition, Needham et al. (1996) Period 5; c. 1500-1150 BC. The palstave is of an early type and is unlooped, and is also without either a shield pattern or a mid-rib on the blade. The palstave would appear to belong to Group III palstaves of Low-Flanged (Broad-Blade) form, the lack of cast blade decoration on this example makes it difficult to categorise to a specific type, but would appear to be dated to c. 1350-1200BC.  
  The palstave is relatively slight, compared to the more massive Acton Park type. The sides are parallel as far as the stop, and then gradually diverge to a slightly expanded blade. The blade edge is gently curved with a long (14mm) blade facet. The blade sides have been pronounced on the upper blade, forming low ribs. The bar stop is straight and meets the flange at a right angle; on the blade side, the stop is near vertical before arcing to the blade face and forming a ‘bar ledge stop’. The flanges are low, as defined by the type, and diverge laterally to a diagonal step before the stop. The butt is eroded, but seems to have had a V-shaped nick. The sides are slightly rounded and convex. The casting seams are discernible but largely eroded. One side appears wider on one half of the mould side than the other. Much of the surface of the palstave has been lost, but survives to a greater extent on one face and appears to have a black patchy coating or patina.","The palstave is of particular interest because of the unusual absence of cast decoration on the face, and together with the lack of a loop, possibly suggests an earlier date within the type. The relatively sophisticated form and profile however may hint at a slightly later date. Whilst Low-Flanged palstaves are not uncommon finds from the welsh Middle Bronze Age (some 120 recorded examples), a palstave without the characteristic ornament or loop makes the find of archaeological interest and difficult to parallel with known examples.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-12-01T00:00:00Z,,,,309.2,,,26.6,122.7,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Angle,SM8503,From a paper map,51.684491,-5.111647,NMGW-22B071,,DSCN2037.JPG,Palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2037.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/17734.jpg

61793,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"Unlooped Early Palstave of Group II, probably an example of the Early Midribbed palstaves of Type Coed Llan and belonging to the later Acton Park metalworking stage of the Middle Bronze Age. Needham (1996) grouped Acton 2 metalwork with Taunton and Penard as his Period 5 (c. 1500-1150BC), It could be suggested that this example falls in the earlier section of this date range.

The palstave is complete, but has lost much of the original surface, particularly on one face. The butt is straight and meets the sides at a right-angle. The sides are parallel as far as the stop, and then gently diverge and turn out sharply at the blade tips. The flanges are curved and define a pointed oval with the blade sides. Both sides exhibit the remnants of prominent broad casting flashes and one of the flanges has a prominent casting flaw. The blade edge is deeply curved. The septum is slightly rounded, and unusually, the stop is different on each face. The face with more of the surface surviving has a straight stop, which meets the flange facets in a right-angle, while the other face has a rounded U-shaped stop. The better preserved face has the suggestion of a very slight poorly defined mid-rib. The blade faces are flat with no working up at the sides, but have a slight depression before the blade facet. The blade is notably asymmetrical, with one blade tip positioned further back than the other. It is possible this may be the result of differential wear on the blade through use.","This example can be best paralleled with numbers 795-6 (pp 127, plate 58) in Scmidt & Burgess' catalogue (1981).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2001-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,464.2,,,31.8,153,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Abergavenny,,,,,NMGW-C905E7,,DSCN2157.JPG,Palstave (side),The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2157.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/20295.jpg

This is a symmetrical slender halberd blade of cast copper or bronze. Down the centre of the blade is a straight midrib. This is wide and angular in cross-section, at the top end tapering with a straight line into the haft-plate. The blade edges have been entirely removed, thus also removing any traces of bevelling originally along the edge. Whilst much of this damage is due to erosion of fragile edges, it is possible that some edges were notched through use wear or mutilation prior to burial. The erosion seems particularly deep and severe, with concave eroded depressions side by side, creating a 'nibbled' effect in places along the blade edge, almost as if notches were later prone to differentially high erosion. The blade end is blunt. The haft-plate is also heavily eroded, though is angular rather than rounded in shape. The halberd reveals evidence of four rivet holes, positioned as two lateral pairs on the haft-plate (rather than being arranged in an arc along it). The lower two are complete, whilst the upper two are visible only as partial grooves along the line of the eroded hilt-plate edges. The whole blade has been bent, as viewed in side section, probably in antiquity, there being no evidence of modern impact. The blade remains sturdy, yet is pitted across its surfaces. The overall patination is green, yet the eroded pits have a light green patina.
","Halberds have recently been reassessed by Needham (2015) and a new typology presented for the British series. This halberd was published within Needham's paper (Cat.No.20) and falls within Type Pistill Dewy, which is characterised by four rivets in a trapezoidal formation following the hilt (Needham 2015, Appendix S1, p.23).

Three ribbed South Wales Type socketed axe of cast bronze. One upper face and most of the mouth top has broken away, whilst the loop is broken. This medium sized axe is slender in form, with slightly divergent sides, widening near the blade end to form an expanded blade with slight recurving at the edges. The casting seams down each side of the axe remain prominent, though seem to have been blunted and rounded, possibly through hammering. The axe has a rectangular cross section, though the face edges are slightly curved. Three well-defined longitudinal ribs extend from the underside of a prominent outsplayed mouth moulding, converging slightly towards the blade end. The blade edge has entirely corroded away, although hammer marks and striations on the blade bevel, parallel to the blade edge, indicate that the axe blade was prepared and sharpened for use. The axe has minor casting blemishes upon the inner socket surfaces and on one outer face, though not serious enough to affect it functioning as an axe, whilst the socket base is flat and deep. The mouth, break edges and blade edge are severely corroded, light green and powdery. When reported for identification there were a number of additional corroded small fragments, which had detached themselves from the axe. Most of the axe surfaces are original and have a good dark-brown to black patina.

Inside the socket of the axe were found well mineralised plant fragments, possibly grass stems, which were removed for study. These may have been within the socket when it was deposited within the ground.

63682,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1750,"This is a large developed flat axe of bronze dating to the Early Bronze Age. The butt is modestly rounded, though with angular corners. The sides are straight, but slightly divergent for just under three quarters of the length of the axe, curving out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded and deeply crescentic cutting edge. All of the original blade edges have been removed by erosion, thereby preventing accurate calculation of the original width and recurve of the blade edge. Approximately 57mm from the butt end is a straight stop-ridge across the axe. The margins of the septum are defined by shallow flanges, which appear to have been hammered up, rather than being cast. The axe sides are faceted: each has an angled mid-ridge, each facet being covered with hammer marks. These tend to be aligned at a consistent diagonal angle across both facets, with no apparent pattern. Nevertheless, they provide some decorative quality to the axe sides. On one upper septum face, there are feint linear dashes or scratches running longitudinally, possibly decorative rain-drop decoration, now barely visible. On each upper blade margin there is a distinct, shallow, hammered crescentic groove, defining the edge of the blade bevel. Striations are visible on each blade bevel, indicating that the blade was prepared and sharpened. Original surfaces survive over most of the axe and these have dark brown patination. However, original surfaces have been lost on the butt, down one lower side, in patches over one blade bevel and around the blade edge. Here, the bronze has a light green patina.","This axe can be classed as Type Bandon (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or a probable Class 4 (follow Needham 1983; forthcoming), dating to Periods 3-4 of the Early Bronze Age (c.1950-1500 BC) (Needham 1996).

The casting seams are prominent on both sides and are likely to have been finished by hammering. The sides are straight and diverge slightly at the blade. Sharpening striations are visible on both of the blade faces. The striations are angled across the blade, towards the sides on the front (gouged) face, and are positioned along the blade circumference on the (circular) back face. Inside the socket at the mouth are two incised or possibly cast lines; one on the rim and the other 2.5mm into the socket.

This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class IIa category, which is characterised by a deep collar and narrow blade. Classes of gouges are difficult to distinguish chronologically, but can be broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age, particularly the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (c.1150-750 BC), though different forms continue in use into the Early Iron Age.

Characteristically for the type, the palstave is slender with a narrow blade, low-flanges and was looped (now broken). The butt is slightly angled and is irregular, possibly through damage. The septum is concave and the stop is straight with right angles to the flanges. The sides are straight and parallel above the stop and the flanges are rounded, forming an elipse with the blade faces.

Single-looped, narrow-bladed and slender palstave of cast bronze. Part of the butt-end of the palstave is missing, whilst the loop has broken off in antiquity. This narrow palstave form exhibits waisting below the stop, the upper sides above the stop being very slightly convex. The sides below the stop are slightly concave and curve outwards into a moderately expanding, but narrow cutting edge. The cutting edge is now blunted, but moderately crescentic in plan. A prominent midrib or mid-ridge descends from the stop on each face, whilst the face edges are rounded. This gives the palstave a lozenge shaped cross-section immediately beneath the stop. The flanges of the palstave are heavily eroded near to the stop, therefore obscuring the characteristic side view of this axe form, which appears as an elongated lozenge. In side view, the stop curves outward gradually, rather than as an angular overhang. Most of the original surfaces of the palstave are lost, with local original surface patches above the stop on each side and on one upper face. The palstave is thus heavily eroded, with extensive pitting visible along the lower blade end. The palstave has a dark green to brown patination.

65494,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1100,"Socket fragment from a Middle Bronze Age side-looped spearhead, possibly falling with the Taunton-Penard metalworking phases (c.1400-1100 BC). The spearhead is represented by the socket only and none of the blade survives, making a typological classification difficult. The socket tapers gradually to the break. The two side loops (c. 19. x 6 mm) are low and flat with a roughly lozenge-shaped plate. Casting seams are clear on both sides below the loops, and have been neatly finished by filing. The striations from the filing survive around the loops. The base of the spearhead is slightly thinner, with a gentle step 5mm from the base. The casting seams have been removed before the step. The surface of the fragment has survived well with a dark brown patina.","The low, flat nature of the side loops indicate this was probably part of Davis' (2012) Group 6 (developed side-looped spearhead), which dates to the Taunton-Penard phases as defined by Needham et al. (1997). However, similar side loops can be observed on earlier spearheads dating to the preceding Acton Park 2 phase (c.1600-1400 BC), which are defined instead by the blade shape so exact dating is not possible.

It has also suffered from corrosion, however, there are a number of large sub-oval and circular holes or pits in the metal. The majority of these may have been formed through corossion, but the largest is probably an air-pocket in the metal formed when the axe was cast.

72277,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1400,"A complete cast Bronze Age palstave axehead (length: 163.5mm; width: at cutting edge: 69mm; thickness at flange facets: 33mm; over 200g).  The butt of the axehead is fairly corroded and pointed to a tip.  The septum measures 18mm wide with flange tops protruding upwards at either side by 11.5mm in height.  The stop is 62.5mm down the length of the septum with a shield-shaped impression on the other side, measuring approximately 29mm in length down the blade, probably as a form of decoration.  At either side of the axehead as the flange tops slope downwards after the stop, there is a nick which protrudes outwards very slightly.  The length of the blade from the end of the shield-shaped pattern to the blade facet measures 65.5mm and it slopes downwards to the start of the possible blade facet which begins approximately 14mm from the edge. The blade splays outwards nearer the edge to form a cresent shape with blade tips on either side.  The cutting edge is heavily corroded which some of the surface patina worn/ corroded away, particularly by bronze disease.  The casting seam is visible on either side of the axe and continues down the overall length of the flange and the blade side.  Overall, the axehead is in a worn and corroded condition in certain areas and has a dark brown-black patina.


This axehead is similar to shield-shaped palstaves of the Acton metalwork, as mentioned in Rohl & Needham's 1998 paper 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis': see reference numbers 92-6.  The Acton metalwork dates from 1500-1400 BC and comes under the Deverel Rimbury and allied groups grave series, showing the major burial tradition in England and Wales at the time.  There similar artefacts in the Birmingham Museum Collection, as illustrated in Philip J Watson's 1993 paper titled 'Catalogue of British & European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums; reference numbers 123 & 5, especially those with the shield-shaped patterning.  No 123 is a palstave with high flanges extending beyond the stop ridge with shield pattern decoration.  It can be classified as Burgess group B/A from County Londonderry, Londonderry.  No 125 is an unlooped palstave with trident pattern, broken butt and has been classified as Burgess group A. and was found at Antrim, Ballymoney.  Other similar examples include those from Chepstow Bridge (Gloucestershire) and Arreton (Isle of Wight), as illustrated in S. M. Pearce's 'Bronze Age Metalwork in southern Britain'; see fig 7c & 8e.


Pearce calls these palstaves 'the backbone of the Middle bronze Age industry' (page 23).  They are a technical improvement on the ealrier flanged axes.  The earliest palstaves lack side loops and have their blades decorated with a midrib (Group 1 type) like that from Chepstow, or with a shield pattern (Group 2 type).  Early midrib and shield pattern palstaves were also being manufactured byt the Acton Park smiths of North Wales and by smiths in eastern Britain before 1400 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,1997-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,,,,33,163.5,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,South Staffordshire,Teddesley Hay,,,,,WMID-A37D33,,WMID-A37D33  2.jpg,"The side view of a cast bronze palstave axe, dating from c.1500-1400 BC.",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-A37D33  2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/33199.jpg
72288,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1275,-1140,"A rare and important find for Essex of an almost complete Bronze Age bronze arrowhead. Cast in one piece, this arrowhead is barbed and tanged in form, with the two sides forming an angle of approximately 35 degrees. It is 39.76mm long, 19.82mm wide from barb to barb, 2.56mm thick and weighs 5.10g. The extreme end of the point is missing and the barbs are damaged and truncated. The tang, which is complete and rectangular in plan is 7.8mm and the barbs are 3.48mm and 2.38mm long respectively. The arrowhead has a low mid ridge, making the object bevelled on one face and so gives it a triangular section. Much of the original surface survives with a dark green patina, but it is heavily scratched and pitted. The exposed surfaces are mid green in colour. There is one small patch of bright green corrosion to one side of the longer tang.


There is only one bronze arrowhead from a secure Bronze Age context in Britain and that was in the Penard hoard, first reported in Archaeologica 71, page 138. The Penard arrowhead has a mid rib as opposed to ridge, but is still barbed and tanged. At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import as there are numerous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France.


However, thanks to an increase in the number of reported metal detected finds, Bronze Age bronze arrowheads are now growing in number, though they remain a rare group of artefact. Dr Colin Pendleton reports that Suffolk has 17 known examples, of which 5 can be termed barbed and tanged. Norfolk has at least 4 recorded and more examples are being added to the database from around the country. This suggests that bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition.


The arrowhead reported here is the first known from Essex and as such is an important discovery for the county, as well as adding to the growing British corpus. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age to the Middle Bronze Age, the evidence from Penard, which dates from 1275-1140 BC, suggests that copper alloy arrowheads did not come into fashion until later in the Middle Bronze Age. Therefore this is the suggested date range for this arrowhead.


Thanks are extended to Dr Stuart Needham of the British Museum for his opinion on this artefact.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,5.1,,,2.56,39.76,1,Caroline McDonald,Caroline McDonald,Eastern,Essex,Uttlesford,Hadstock,,,,,ESS-A41D75,,Barker arrowhead 2 to 1.jpg,Bronze Age copper alloy arrowhead 2:1,Colchester Museums,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/Barker arrowhead 2 to 1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/33331.jpg
72437,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1300,"An incomplete cast bronze axehead (length: 87.1mm; width: 37mm; thickness: 30.5mm; weight: 197.41g).  The butt of the axe has been broken and is badly corroded with some small areas of bronze disease.  The septum's length from the butt to the stop of the axe measures 66mm (as well as a width of 19mm), with low flanges measuring between 5-7mm in height either side.  The blade end of the axe has broken off 21mm after the stop, but this is far enough to notice a central rib running down its length on both sides, leading to what would have been the blade. The flange side is triangular in shape with a loop protruding outwards by 7.2mm level to where the stop is.  Overall, this incomplete axehead is in a fair but corroded condition in some areas, particularly  at the butt, flange facets and beyond the stop.  It is difficult to identify the true colour and patina of the axehead and the artefact has been coated in a substance, but it seems to have a patchy brown/ black patina with various areas of bronze disease.


This axehead seems to have similarities with other examples identified as from the Taunton industries, so called because of an especially rich series of finds that was made in the Vale of Taunton, dating from approximately 1400-1300 BC (Rohl & Needham, 1998, page 119, figure 21).  According to Pearce (1984, page 24), side loops became a regular feature in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age palstave industries, and the ribbed decoration was still popular from earlier examples.  A similar example of a ribbed palstave is illustrated in Pearce's book (Page 25, Fig 8a, Ref A) and was found at Cemmaes, Powys.


Many other examples are illustrated in Watson's 'Catalogue of British & European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', 1993, Ref Nos 47-51 among the illustrated plates.

75136,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-900,"Complete, cast copper alloy Middle Bronze Age, side looped, spearhead. This spearhead has a narrow leaf shaped blade with a lozenge shaped section. The shaft is circular in section and socketed. To either side of the shaft, halfway along its length, is a lozenge or leaf shaped side loop, both of which are slightly flattened against the shaft. There is no peg hole on the shaft. The casting seams are not visible, except for a raised but smoothed seam of metal above one of the side loops. The original surface is mostly intact and has a mid brown patina. The object has suffered damage in a variety of forms. The surface is pitted and scratched, notable at the blade tip and along the mid rib. The edges of the blade are chipped. There is a subsquare nick at the mouth of the socket that has caused two cracks to run up the shaft to just below one of the side loops, and a triangular nick that has not resulted in cracking. There is also a sub oval hole running from one of the side loops. These signs of damage are worn smooth and evenly patinated suggesting that they occurred in antiquity. However there is a large amount of scratching to the object surface, which may be the result of more modern damage, possibly over harsh cleaning. There are also two grooves on the object that are shiny bronze in colour that are definitely due to recent damage.



The socket of the spearhead is blocked with compacted soil, as are the side loops. Under microscopic inspection there are traces of a fibrous material that may be leather or heavily decayed wood, but not enough survives to get a positive identification. The soil is probably compacted due to the post depositional environment. Because of this blockage, it is not known how far the socket extends into the shaft. The spearhead is 145.06mm long, of which 54.34mm is the shaft, 28.56mm at the widest point of the blade and 10.72mm thick at the mid rib. The socket mouth has a diameter of 18.78mm. The side loops are 18mm long and the bottom of the loop begins 20.78mm from the end of the shaft. The object weighs 72.75g. A parallel for this spearhead can be seen in Ehrenberg, 1977 number 25. Ehrenberg comments that spearheads of this type date from the Middle Bronze Age period, but it is thought those with the flattened side loops continued into the later Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-07-31T23:00:00Z,,,,72.75,,18.78,10.72,145.06,1,Caroline McDonald,Caroline McDonald,Eastern,Essex,Braintree,Wethersfield,,,,,ESS-EBFB42,,Spearhead edited.jpg,"Bronze Age side looped spear head, reverse view",Colchester Museums,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/Spearhead edited.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/36496.jpg

75484,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete small axe or more likely an axe-chisel, cast from copper alloy. The surviving portion is wedge shaped, with rectangular faces which are almost straight when seen from the side, and that meet to form a curving blade edge that appears to have had little secondary bevel. The sides, when looking at the face, are slightly concave along the length, curving outwards to the blade. The middle of the blade edge has broken off in the past, but appears once to have a narrow curve of maybe 120°, with no flaring of the tips; the rounded tips are 19.31m apart. The hollow interior is cone-shaped. The artefact has a sub-rectangular cross-section with walls between 2.06mm and 4.34mm thick. The artefact has been broken off at the end, but it appears that part of the butt is still present: if this is correct then the artefact was once around 47-50mm in length. There is a casting seam running along one face. There is no decoration on the artefact, suggesting an everyday rather than ceremonial purpose. The artefact is very worn, with heavy corrosion, although some of the original smooth surface survives (around 40%), with a light greenish-grey colour. The rest has a mottled, greenish-grey colour, and a very pitted texture. All the evidence points towards this being a tool for carving wood- that is for ornamental carving. The round blade edge would make it versatile, enabling the carver to work with a concave area, and the bevel of the whole tool- at around 20°, makes it ideal for very fine work where thin slivers of wood are being removed. This is a fine ¾ inch chisel. The fact that it is cast with an integral socket (for the wooden handle it once had) suggests a Middle- Late Bronze Age date.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2002-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,31.84,,,12.67,46.92,1,Liz Andrews-Wilson,Liz Andrews-Wilson,South East,East Sussex,Wealden,Arlington,TQ5507,From a paper map,50.841771,0.200131,SUSS-19D9F0,,3-57.jpg,Axe chisel ,Sussex Archaeological Society,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/lwilson/3-57.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/36950.jpg

Even though the artefact is badly corroded and broken at tip and socket, the fairly prominent midrib with blade wings are still visible.  The artefact has a circular socketed shaft which is open into the hollow cavity of the head.  As well as general amounts of corrosion, there is a significant amount of bronze disease present in the bottom of the hollow shaft.  There is also a small hole along the line of the midrib halfway down the blade.  The possible arrowhead has a dark green/ brown patina.

Bronze arrowheads dating to this period are extremely rare in Britain, with one found as part of a hoard in Penard, Wales (Savory, 1980, oage 57) as well as possible arrowheads found on the Isle of Portland, Sussex, Yorkshire, Montgomeryshire and another on display in Norwich Museum.

There is a similar example illustrated in Watson's 'Catalogue of British & European Prehistoric Metal in Birmingham City Museums', 1993, page 11, ref no 87, found in Kingsbury, Warwickshire.

These spearheads were also popular in southern England.



This example may have had a short stabbing blade (mostly likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age I between c. 1450-1250 BC) or a longer weapon (mostly likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age II period between c. 1250-1050 BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2001-01-01T00:00:00Z,2001-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,13.81,,13.7,,52.8,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Swynnerton,SJ8538,From finder,52.939181,-2.224639,WMID-D2A721,,WMID-D2A721.jpg,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy Middle Bronze Age spearhead, dating between 1450-1050 BC.",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-D2A721.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/37755.jpg

With only a small part of the septum, butt and some of the side loop missing, the axehead is otherwise complete, even though it is in a very badly corroded state.  The flanges to either side of the septum are very slight (possibly also due to corrosion), as is the stop.  There are remains of one side loop positioned at the stop.  The blade is rather chunky in form without any indentations or ridges beyond the stop.  The blade tip and cutting end only spans slightly.

The spearhead is complete and is 149.4mm long and weighs 101.3g. The circular socket has an external diameter at the mouth of 19.2mm. Adhering to the inside of the socket is a ring of surviving wood from the spear shaft, (the spear was deposited or lost in a wetland esturine environment). The sides of the socket converge towards the blade. Midway between the blade and the end of the socket are attachment loops (external dimensions 16 x 6mm) with irregular oval tops. The spearhead has a leaf shaped blade (maximum width 30.8mm) with straight converging blade edges. The socket continues as a solid rounded midrib as far as the tip. Bevelled blade edges are evident although eroded. The spearhead had a dark green to brown patina.","This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.301) and classed within his Type 6B Developed side-looped (Flame, flat blade, lozenge plates). Davis (2012, 76f.) lists 83 of this type of spearhead from Britain, with a concentration around the Thames Valley and a spread across Central England and Wales.



The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and elsewhere, and is similar to Savory (1980) No. 337:2. A similar side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has recently been dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.

  The socket rim is a rectangular with rounded corners and edges. The rim on the exterior of the axe is moulded with a single ridge which tapers towards the body of the axe. The rim is regular, therefore the socket mouth is also a rectangular shape. The interior of the socket is smooth, no casting seams or ribs are visible. 


  
  The body of the axe is short and wide. The blade tips flare outwards quickly, and they are asymmetrical. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical, this maybe due to ware, or the cutting edge being slightly abraded. Otherwise the cutting edge is quite sharp. 


  
  The sides are straight until they reach the blade tips. They have casting seams visible. One side has the integral semi-circular loop positioned near the rim. In section the loop is a sub-lozenge shape, which is mainly due to the casting seams. 


  
  The exterior surface of the axe has a patchy surface which has the start of a patina. There is some recent damage, scrapes, on the surface.

The sword blade is leaf-shaped and is widest at the centre of the fragment. The combined fragments (c. 300mm) probably represent a little over three quarters of the original blade length and approximately half the original length of the sword. The blade has a low lozenge shaped section, with a rounded mid-section and slightly concave outer section. The blade edges have been lost, but the start of the bevel is discernible in areas. The blade appears to have been bent prior to breaking, as evidenced by visible metal stress on the inside of the bend either side of the fracture. The sword bent by an angle of approximately 25 degrees before breaking. The bending has also resulted in both fragments being curved along their length. The sword was probably bent and broken prior to its deposition. One of the ends (probably the tip end) has deep parallel striations running along the blade on the mid section, which are also likely to have occurred in antiquity.

The base of the socket is circular to the position of the circular peg holes (6mm diameter), positioned 40mm from the end.

The chisel is represented by the blade, collar, and the beginning of the tang and has a surviving length of 44.7mm. The tang has broken just above the collar, which survives as a low transverse ridge on each face and is more projecting on the sides. The collar has a surviving width of 8.7mm, but is very worn. The thickness at this point is 6.2mm. The blade is crinoline in plan with a gently curved cutting edge of 16.6mm width. Much of the original surface has been lost and the chisel is eroded.","Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



The crinoline shape of the blade is quite unusual and reminiscent of some Middle Bronze Age palstave forms, though is less well-known from later contexts. Additionally, later collars are typically more prominent. This may suggest this is an earlier form of tanged and collared chisel.



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales.

The axehead is a small example with a length of 77.8mm, and is also comparatively slender with a width at the bevel of 19.9mm. The butt is rounded and the sides are near-parallel (with a width at the butt of 18.2mm) as far as the bevel. After the bevel, the sides curve very gently outwards as far as the blade, where the sides turn out sharply to the blade tips, producing an expanded cutting edge with a surviving width of 39.0mm. The edges of the faces are raised slightly (1mm), but have been eroded and the sides are convex across their thickness. The faces are flat either side of the bevel, which is positioned 34mm from the butt. The blade begins 17mm from the edge. The surface of the axe has been largely lost, in addition to the cutting edge and one of the blade tips.","Class 4 axes straddle the boundary between Periods 2 and 3, but this axe can be confidently assigned to Period 3, probably falling within the late Aylesford to Willerby metalworking phases (c.1950-1750 BC) (Needham et al. 1997). At the time of writing (Aug 17) 27 Class 4 axes dating to this period are currently known from across Wales, the vast majority being single finds.



A Class 4E axe was found at Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan and is now in AC-NMW collections (Savory 1980, No 388.1); it has recently been radiocarbon dated, producing an early date of 1900 -1800 BC.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,88.5,,,11.3,77.8,1,Mark Lodwick,Katrina Deering,South East,Hampshire,Basingstoke and Deane,Hannington,,,,,NMGW-8D6411,,DSCN2489.JPG,Blade end,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/kdeering/DSCN2489.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/50725.jpg

BC), falling within the later half of Period 4 (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997).



The axe is incomplete, missing the butt and one of the blade tips. The axe has a surviving length of 73.5mm and would have had an approximate length of 110mm when complete. The sides are straight and near parallel, with a width at the septum of 28.2mm. The flanges and sides are gently rounded and convex, with a maximum height of 15.6mm. The sides have hammered decoration of diagonal markings. The sides curve out sharply just above the blade to produce a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. The blade face is slightly convex, while the face is slightly dished. There is a straight median bevel and the axe has a thickness at the bevel of 12.2mm. Both faces have a number of small hammer marks of c. 2mm diameter. Sharpening striations running along the cutting edge are evident on both faces.

The fragment is 61mm in length and the surviving cutting edge is 38mm wide. Its estimated original cutting edge width is 43mm. At the ancient break, the cross section is rectangular and measures 20x15mm. It is a clean, and therefore probably purposeful, break.
One face is extremely pitted and ever so slightly concaved in section, so it appears bent. The pitting may therefore have been caused by repeated hammer blows. On the opposite face is a deep roughly horizontal cut.

The spearhead is corroded and incomplete, missing most of the blade and some of the socket on one face. The spearhead has a surviving height of 82.6mm and a maximum external diameter at the mouth of 18mm. The sides of the socket converge comparatively sharply towards the beginning of the blade. The socket continues along the blade to form a prominent rounded midrib. The sides of the socket are slightly pronounced and have the suggestion of side or socket loop stubs approximately 11mm apart. Much of the socket on one face is missing; some of this may be the result of miscasting (where the core has been incorrectly aligned), rather than later damage. The socket has a surviving depth of 63mm. The remnants of the blade are evident on both sides, but little of the blade survives. The spearhead weighs 25.6g (after cleaning).","This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.646) and classed within his Group 6 Developed side-looped, though due to this objects incompleteness it could not be assigned a sub-type. Davis (2012) notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades, which might strengthen the idea that this spearhead originally had a flame-shaped blade, rather than a leaf-shaped blade. The spearhead is likely to have been quite short and can be paralleled with a number of similar examples in National Museum & Galleries of Wales' collections (Savory 1980, Nos. 227-230).



A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has recently been dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.

The spearhead is complete and is a relatively long and slender example of the type, with a length of 163mm and maximum width across the blade of 26.3mm. The spearhead weighs 74.0g. The circular socket end has an external diameter at the mouth of 17.8mm. The end of the socket is decorated with three horizontal grooves around the circumference. The sides of the socket converge towards the blade. Midway between the blade and the end of the socket are attachment loops with oval tops (external dimensions 15 x 5mm). The socket becomes increasingly lozenge sectioned as it approaches the blade. The flame shaped blade is slender and is comparatively slight with a consistent thickness of 1mm and without a bevelled blade edge. The blade has a number of possibly decorative grooves running alongside the midrib. The blade edge is straight and comparatively long (90mm) and has a number of nicks and distortions; this damage is likely to have occurred in antiquity (M. Davis pers comm.). The lozenge sectioned socket develops into pointed and prominent midribs along the blade. A number of small casting flaws are evident on the blade. The surface of the spearhead has survived well and has a mid brown patina. Northover (unpublished) sees socket looped spearheads as a largely Irish type. The type has been known to occur through late Acton Park to Pennard but concentrated in the Cemmaes industry. The mouth decoration, thin and slender blade and pointed midrib on this example are a little unusual. The mouth decoration can be paralleled on a side-looped spearhead from Hod Hill (Pearce 1983, No. 443) and the slender form can be paralleled in examples recorded by Ehrenberg (1977, nos. 25, 26, 28, 140, 143).","This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.290) and classed within his Type 6B Developed side-looped (Flame, flat blade, lozenge plates).

90433,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Blade end fragment from a Late Bronze Age Socketed axe, c. 1150-800BC of likely Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking traditions, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 6 - 7. While socketed axeheads can date from anytime within the Late Bronze Age, most diagnostic finds tend to date to the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC). The axe head is represented by the blade only and has a maximum surviving length of 35.8mm. The bottom of the socket is present and has been deliberately closed by battering; this damage is also likely to have contributed to the break. Both faces are concave as a result of the damage, the bronze has torn on one face and deep battering scars are evident on the other face. The surviving portion of the side is straight with angles converging to the neatly finished casting seam (giving the axe a hexagonal body profile). The blade is expanded at the tips, producing a surviving blade width of 51.8mm. The Blade edge is curved and has also been damaged and blunted. Most of the surface has been lost, although a small area near the blade has the suggestion of sharpening striations running along the blade. The original surface has a dark green patina, while underlying exposed surface is pale green.

91189,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-750,"Late Bronze Age copper alloy socketed gouge.



The socketed gouge dates to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1100-750BC and dates to the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (Needham et al. 1997), corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period's 6-7. The gouge is comparatively short, with an overall length of 55.6mm. The socket is oval with an external width (across the blade) of 21.3mm and an external height of 19.7mm (internal: 17.7 x 16.6mm). The mouth of the gouge is plain, and 2.4mm beneath the mouth is a square collar moulding, with a width of 2mm. The sides of the gouge are slightly concave and expand at the blade tips, giving a width at the blade of 18.6mm. The casting flashes are visible on both sides and have minimal finishing. On one side, the flashes have been hammered for most of the length but are high and sharp near the collar. On the other side the flashes may have not been finished and are deep and wide. The blade edge largely survives and is convex. Sharpening striations are evident on the blade and run both along the blade and perpendicular to it. The surface of the gouge survives well with a dark brown patina. The under-face has an unusual linear effect, possibly the result of a mineralised organic. The gouge weighs 40.1g. The finder responsibly did not clean out the socket of the gouge. Excavation of the socket revealed remnants of the wooden handle preserved. The wood has been retained at NMGW.","Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilburton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. Potential radiocarbon dating of the wood recovered from the socket could be useful in resolving this problem. The gouge can be paralleled with a larger and unprovenanced example in the Macalpine collection (Antiquities from Europe and the Near East, No. 11.61).



David Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class III, which is characterised by its small, squat form and limited mouth mouldings, though typically this Class has a wider cutting edge.",3,Copper alloy,Wood,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,40.1,,,,55.6,1,Mark Lodwick,Katrina Deering,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Llaneugrad,SH4783,,53.321749,-4.298508,NMGW-283DE4,,DSCN3377.JPG,Bronze Age socketed gouge,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/DSCN3377.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/626259.jpg

The blade end of the axe is corroded but the angle suggests that it may have had a crescentic blade. Both faces of the axe are decorated with straight lines punched into the axe after casting, about 5mm in length, and about 1mm apart, in what is referred to as a 'rain pattern'. The axe is 113mm long, 52mm wide at the blade end, 23mm wide at the butt end, 10mm in thickness and weighs 186.03g.

    
    Comparable examples of decorated flat axes from the Southwest can be found in Pearce (1983) from Southleigh in Devon (p.455 & 600, Plate 39 No.297) and from Mount Pleasant in Dorset (p.468 & 609, Plate 48, No.371). But the decoration on this axe covers the whole axe and is more regular and evenly spaced like the example from Preston Down, Weymouth (p.487 & 621, Plate 60, No.480). There is also a similar example in the Royal Institution of Cornwall’s collections from Ladock where there are marks between the flanges, but these are sparse and irregular.

    
    Flat axes decorated with this ‘rain pattern’ and with crescentic blades can be found during the Mile Cross-Aylesford phase (c.2000-1900 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl& Needham 1998, 124, Fig. 25, No.47). Examples with the continuous rain-pattern are found in the following Willerby-Bush Barrow phase (c.1900-1700 BC), such as the Class 4 axes illustrated in Rohl & Needham (1998, 125, Fig. 26, No.57 & B).",,3,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2000-08-31T23:00:00Z,2000-11-30T00:00:00Z,,,186.03,,,10,113,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Lesnewth,SX1191,From a paper map,50.687875,-4.67704,CORN-C53643,,Osbornefinds 006.jpg,detail of blade showing rain pattern,Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Osbornefinds 006.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/57949.jpg

95886,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-800,"Copper-alloy socketed looped axehead of Irish Late Bronze Age Type. Due to the short, stocky body of axes of this type, they is referred to as 'bag-shaped' or 'purse-shaped'.  The axe's exact measurements are:  57mm in length, the blade width is 43mm, the width of the socket is 31-37mm (inner-outer), the breadth of the socket is 22-27mm (inner-outer, back-front) and the axe weighs 78.97g. These measurements show that the mouth of the axe is aligned with the blade and not back-to-front shaped. The blade was re-worked after the casting process and it is still slightly splayed. However, the axe was in use and it was re-sharpened as well; there are indications of parallel re-sharpening marks close to the cutting edge. The axe was thinly cast and possibly the alloy used was probably more tinny than the normal alloy - the mouth has shows a crack which probably happened while it was in use. However, the damage was obviously no reason to discard the axe.


This socketed axe type is called 'Irish' because most of them were found in Ireland - however, a great number were also found in Scotland, Wales and N/W and S/W England.

The axe is complete and is comparatively small with a length of 72.7mm and a weight of 181.2g, possibly suggesting a lead rich bronze. The mouth has external dimensions of 44.0 x 37.6mm and has the four casting runner stubs visible. The socket has an oval profile at the mouth with internal dimensions of 30 x 26.5mm and is 58.4mm deep. The axe has a single mouth moulding, which tapers to the face. The loop springs from the base of the moulding. The casting flashes are prominent on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The axe body has a more rounded form than is usual for the type with a sub-rectangular section of 37mm width below the loop. Both faces are decorated with three, widely spaced converging weak ribs. The blade is recurved, producing a rounded blade edge with a length of 45.5mm. The axe has a green to brown patina and has recently been coated in a varnish.","This axe possesses a combination of features typically of two well-established axe types. Stylistically this axe shares many properties with Yorkshire-type axes, which are defined by widely-spaced ribs descending from a fairly prominent, slightly everted collar, and often have a small, stumpy appearance with an expanded blade edge (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 223). However, ribs on Yorkshire type axes typically run parallel or slightly diverge; no examples could be found in Schmidt and Burgess's corpus of Yorkshire axes possessing converging ribs. Similarly, the rounded socket is unusual. Furthermore, the four runner casting technology is a feature found solely in the production of South Wales axes. South Wales axes often have prominent casting seams, as seen on the Penllyn axe, and converging ribs, though these are typically not as widely-spaced.



This axe is thus best seen as a hybrid of two axe-making traditions. In form it most closely parallels Yorkshire axes, but it was produced using South Wales production methods and incorporates features of this latter axe type. These axes were in contemporary production in different regions and thus it is not inconceivably that the technologies might permeate into other areas. Yorkshire-type socketed axes have been found alongside South Wales axes in the hoards from Llantilio Crossenny 2, Monmouthshire (NMGW-AFDAE8), Tal y garn 2, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt and Lodwick 2003), and Llangwm, Monmouthsire (Lodwick and Gwilt 2001).

In 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age', savory states that the socketed axe-head represents a change both in the method of hafting and the method of production.

Based on the line drawing this fragment has been reidentified as a group IV dirk or rapier, and not a dagger as previously suggested.

105456,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1725,-1500,"Complete copper alloy low-flanged axe of Early Bronze Age date. The axe belongs to Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming). It can be dated to the Arreton metalworking phase (1725-1500 cal. BC), falling within the later half of Period 4 (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997).



The axehead has an overall length of 122.7mm and weighs 270.7g. The butt is rounded and has a width of 20mm. The septum gradually thickens to the curved and prominent median bevel, positioned 55mm from the butt. The sides are comparatively straight and diverge slightly towards the blade, with a width at the median of 26.5mm and a width of 29mm before the sides expand to the blade. The sides are curved across their thickness. The flanges are lozenge-shaped and are longer at the rear. The flanges come to a point at the butt and because the butt is convex, it is visible as the characteristic 'projecting tongue' when viewed from the side. The flanges have a maximum breadth at the position of the median of 21.6mm. The blade side expands to produce a deep crescentic blade edge with a width of 69.6mm. Blade facets are evident c. 14mm from the blade edge and may have been highlighted by a low step upwards running across the blade which is discernible on both faces. There are striations running across the width of the axe positioned on the blade between the beginning of the flange and the stop, these may possibly be only evident here because of better surface preservation. The striations may have been intended as crude decoration. The axe has been recently treated with an applied coating. The surface, where it survives, has a dark green to black patina (exaggerated by the applied coating) and has a silvery tint, probably because of surface tin enrichment.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-03-01T00:00:00Z,,,,270.7,,,21.6,122.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Market Drayton,,,,,NMGW-D8EEE6,,2005.49.jpg,"Developed flat axe, probably Type Arreton and Early Bronze Age III date or metalworking stage five or Needham's Period 3, c. 2000-1700BC.",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.49.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/75342.jpg

It comes from a plain axe with a 'rope' upper mouth moulding. There is no indication of casting seams, meaning that it is a fragment of a face, not a side of the axe. Moreover, the mouth fragment comes from a mis-cast axe, as the thinness of one side/face and mouth moulding indicate. It is questionable whether or not it was ever used. If the mis-casting meant that it was too incomplete and the structure was too weak for use, it would have been recycled.

105795,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1200,-800,"A fragment from a small cast copper-alloy spearhead or arrowhead, likely to date from the late Bronze Age, from circa 1200 to 800 BC. The weapon is socketed (existing socket size 7.3 mm in diameter). The object is unfortunately broken at both the socketed end and the blade end. The result of the socket causes a convex ridge to run down the obverse and the reverse of the blade. In profile the object is therefore oval with a wing at either side. The edges of the blade begin to taper towards the break at the socketed end of the object, whilst the ridge caused by the socket continues to expand - the original socket size would therefore be somewhate larger than that which remains. Determining whether this find is an arrowhead or a spearhead is not aided by its fragmented nature, although socketed spearheads seem to be better attested than socketed arrowheads in the literature concerning the later Bronze Age. Examples of socketed spearheads are illustrated in Needham (1990, 55; 32/72, 47, 82) and Langmaid (1976, 53; 19).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,5.4,,,8.6,17.9,1,Tom Brindle,Tom Brindle,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,South Northamptonshire,Paulerspury,SP7144,GPS (from the finder),52.089803,-0.965132,NARC-5997F0,,NARC-5997F0spearheadsection.jpg,Fragment from a small late Bronze Age socketed spear or arrowhead,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-5997F0spearheadsection.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/73567.jpg

It was possibly used as an ear ring, although there are a number of other uses for such artefact types. One such use might be a link in a chain. A similar artefact is illustrated in Crummy (1983, 50; 1796) which is cited as being a possible Roman ear ring. However other penannular rings of a not dissimilar nature make up links from a possible chain mesh purse (Crummy 1983, 50; 1850). A definite function for such items is thus difficult to ascertain, and when discovered outside a stratified context determining a date is likewise problematic.

107225,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-700,"Incomplete copper alloy knife, or dagger. The dagger is leaf shaped, slender and roughly a pointed oval in cross-section. Either side of the blade there are developed bevels; two either side of the main ridge angling down towards the blade edge. The blade tapers towards the tip, which is now flat through wear rather than being pointed. The flat tip is well patinated, having the same patination as the blade body. The edges of the blade are damaged in places with small concave 'nicks', and are again covered with the same patination as the blade tip and body. The tang is roughly rectangular and flares slightly towards the gently curved and worn shoulders. There is a single rivet hole in the centre of the tang to attach it to the handle. The rivet hole is circa 4mm in diameter. The surface condition is very poor with extensive loss due to corrosion. Limited areas of original surface, patinated dark brown remain mainly on the tang and the tip-end of the blade. Elsewhere the surface is smooth and medium brown in colour. 


Dating is slightly problematic. In form the knife is similar to some small rivetted knife/daggers of the Camerton-Showshill phase of the late Early Bronze Age to early Middle Bronze Age, though they usually have a flat blade in cross-section. The blade section and rivet notches suggest a Middle Bronze Age date to be most likely, there are similar examples from Beck Row, Mildenhall (Pendleton 1999, Fig 51-206).


Locally, the blade is comparable to one from Bourne, Lincolnshire (Davey, 1973, fig. 19 no. 193, although classified as a dirk), another from Caenby, Lincolnshire (ibid, p90, fig 23, no. 220).











This object was found in association with other Bronze Age, Iron Age and early Roman material, including fIVE terret rings, as listed below. The terret rings were recorded under the Treasure Act (2006 T187) but were declared 'not treasure' due to a lack of evidence to relate them together. The assemblage as a whole however indicates that the site is significant, perhaps as a religious or cult centre.

This is a side fragment from near the blade of a socketed axe of undetermined type and dating from between 1100 and 600 BC. The fragment has a height of 32.5mm, a width of 24.3mm and a maximum thickness of 14.8mm (minimum thickness of 7.2mm). The axe was likely to have been made from a heavily-leaded bronze and the fragment weighs 51.8g. The base of the socket is visible at the top of the fragment with a surviving depth of 7.4mm. The side of the axe is slightly convex and is beginning to curve outwards at the bottom, probably implying a somewhat expanded blade edge.

The pin is complete, but has distorted slightly near the tip and has an overall length of 99.2mm. The pin is of circular section with a diameter of between 3 and 4mm. The head forms a circular ring with an external diameter of 14.2mm (8mm internal). The ring is slightly open with a gap of c.0.5mm between the end of the ring and the neck. The neck forms the characteristic U-bend, before the near right-angle to the pin shaft (86mm in length). The diameter of the shaft is constant until c. 35mm from the tip, where the pin thins to the point. The only decoration evident on the pin is a single incised line on the front and sides of the head, 2mm from the end of the loop. The pin weighs 7.3g and is in good condition with much of the surface preserved and a mid-brown patina. This find represents the twelfth recorded find of ring-headed and swan’s-neck pins in South East Wales (comprising the old counties of Glamorgan & Gwent) (Gwilt in press), including the five recent examples excavated at Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan. Ring-headed pins of this form without a solid ring commonly carry simple decoration with notches on the front of the ring (Dunning 1934, pp274). The simple decoration on this form of pin can be paralleled with an example from Meare in Somerset (ibid. fig 3) and from Margan foreshore in Wales (Wear, unpublished) where an example has further notches along the neck and head. Few ring-headed pins have been recovered from a securely dated context, but the simple form and decoration on this example may suggest a date within the first half of the date range suggested above.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-03-31T23:00:00Z,,,,7.3,,4,,99.2,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9877,,51.482725,-3.4703,NMGW-62BF56,,2005.92.jpg,"Late Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age ring-headed type pin, c. 750-100BC.",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.92.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/78959.jpg
110606,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-950,"Late Bronze Age copper alloy palstave, probably of Type Guilsfield.



The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 147.6mm and is comparatively heavy at 477.1g, implying a heavily-leaded bronze. The butt is straight (23mm wide) and is angled slightly towards the unlooped side. The septum is thick, as is typical for the type, with a thickness at the butt of 6mm and 14mm at the base of the stop. The septum is slightly concave across its width. The flanges are concave and end well before the butt (18mm). The sides before the stop are straight. The stop is rounded, suggesting the type to be 'Guilsfield' and projects prominently above the blade surface. The top of the stop overhangs the septum with a height of 18-19mm. At the stop, the palstave blade has a width of 28.4mm (42.4mm including the loop) and has a thickness of 31.1mm. The sides of the blade are concave and diverge to a narrow and gently curving blade of 45.6mm width. Both sides exhibit the casting seams, which have been finished, probably initially through hammering and then filing, the seam on the unlooped side appears less well finished than the corresponding seam. The sides are comparatively straight across their thickness. The loop has an external width of 26.3mm (13.1mm internal), a maximum thickness of 9.1mm and projects 14mm above the side of the palstave. The exterior of the loop carries small faceting, possibly as a result of multi-directional filing. The blade has a comparatively deep convex curve near the stop, which becomes weaker as it approaches the edge, the blade is otherwise undecorated. Both blades display neat and systematic hammer-marks. The blade edge has been lost but prominent sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces. The palstave has good surface preservation with a mid to dark green patina. Small areas of surface damage and possible bronze disease are visible on the edges and a small recent scrape is visible on one flange, possibly as a result of excavation.","This palstave is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975. The hoard consists of another similar palstave (NMGW-759FC0), a socketed axe (NMGW-75C4F7), a socketed gouge (NMGW-75FE70) and a blade of an uncertain object (NMGW-7621D3).



Both palstaves in this assemblage (this one and NMGWPA 2005.93.2) share many features and are similar in size and weight. Differences in the recurved blade may be a result of eroded blade tips on NMGWPA 2005.93.1, which is generally slightly less well preserved. It appears likely that both palstaves were produced at the same time and possibly from the same mould pairs. Within Wales, as the type may suggest, the palstaves can be best paralleled with the palstaves recovered amongst the hoard found at Guilsfield, Powys. One palstave in particular shares the same flange profile and drop from the stop onto the blade (Savory 1966, Fig.1 (14)). 



This hoard can be fairly confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, resolution within this time period however, is problematic and requires metallurgical analysis to resolve. The palstaves (NMGWPA 2005.93.1-2) are suggested as being of 'Guilsfield' type and suggest manufacture during the Wilburton metalworking industry. Wilburton metalworking corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6 and is dated to c. 1150-950 BC. The socketed axe (NMGWPA 2005.93.3) of Type Gillespie can be dated from late Wilburton to Ewart Park (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pp 193), although Wilburton associations are known (ibid.). Savory (1980, pp 55)1 has suggested that a simple mouth moulding on socketed gouges suggests a later date within the type, probably implying a Ewart Park date for the gouge NMGWPA 2005.93.4, within Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950-750BC, though socketed gouges are known from the Wilburton phase.



The highly tentative parallel drawn between the blade fragment NMGWPA 2005.93.5 and the Acton Park hoard may present a slight possibility of an earlier association dating to the later Middle Bronze Age and of Acton 2 metalworking stage, corresponding to Needham's (ibid.) Period 5 and dated to c. 1500-1150BC. However, the blade may also plausibly represent the lower part of a tanged chisel, such as those seen in the Late Bronze Age hoards from Penwyllt, Powys, and Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No.284(9); No.288(3)).

The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 141.0mm and is comparatively heavy at 483.7g, implying a heavily-leaded bronze. The butt has a width of 24.7mm and is irregular, appearing to have suffered from casting problems with the bronze at the surface appearing to be porous, there is also some hollowing on both sides of the septum adjacent to the butt. This damage may be a result of insufficient bronze when casting. The butt was likely to have been straight and angled slightly towards the unlooped side. The septum is thick, as is typical for the type, with a thickness at the butt of 5mm and 15mm at the base of the stop. The flanges are concave and end well before the butt (17mm), with the flanges on the looped side appearing shorter than on the other. The sides before the stop are straight. The stop is rounded, suggesting the type to be 'Guilsfield' and projects prominently above the blade surface. The top of the stop overhangs the septum with a height of 18-19mm. At the stop the palstave blade has a width of 28.3mm (43.0mm including the loop) and has a thickness of 33.4mm. The sides of the blade are concave and diverge to a slightly expanded blade, producing a curved blade edge of 50.0mm width. Both sides exhibit the casting seams, which have been finished, probably initially through hammering and then filing. The sides are comparatively straight across their thickness. The loop has an external width of 27.9mm (13.9mm internal), a maximum thickness of 9.4mm and projects 15mm above the side of the palstave.

The axe is complete, although the blade edge has been lost and the axe has an overall length of 87.6mm and weighs 129.2g. The mouth is oval with an external width of 35.7mm and an external thickness of 33.2mm (internal - 27.8mm x 24.7mm). The socket has a depth of 74mm and becomes sub-rectangular in section c. 25mm from the mouth. The rim has been carefully finished and no evidence of the casting runner stubs survives. The pronounced flaring, trumpet-shaped mouth is 13mm deep. The separation of the mouth and face is defined by a rounded collar moulding, which is deeper on the mouth side to accentuate the flaring trumpet mouth. The loop begins at the collar moulding and has an external length of 21.3mm (11.6mm internal) and rises to a height of 10mm, with a width of 7.8mm. The casting seams are visible down both sides and have been neatly finished, particularly on the area between the blade and loop. The sides are straight before the blade, where the sides expand and are recurved, producing an expanded cutting edge. Beneath the collar moulding the axe has the hexagonally-faceted form. The faces are slightly convex and rounded. The blade is distinct and begins 15mm from the current edge. Sharpening striations are evident running along both sides of the blade. The axe has generally good surface survival with some damage to the blade.

The socketed gouge is near-complete and has broken in antiquity at the mouth. The gouge may be judged slender with a maximum external diameter at the mouth of 20.2mm (15.6mm internal). The gouge has an overall length of 86.0mm and weighs 46.0g. The mouth is simple and has no mouldings around it. The gouge has a subtle collar 12mm deep. The sides of the gouge are gently concave and converge towards the blade edge. The casting seams are high and have undergone minimal finishing. The gouge groove begins 31mm from the mouth. The blade edge has been lost and it is now unclear weather the blade originally expand at the sides. The blade has a width of 14mm. Sharpening striations are evident running off the blade edge (at 90 degrees) on the face and are angled (at approximately 45 degrees) on the rear of the blade. The gouge generally has good surface survival and has a black or pale green patina. Areas of active bronze corrosion are present at the mouth and on the blade. Savory (1980, pp 55) suggests that earliest socketed gouges such as those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings, whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar.","This gouge is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975. The hoard consists of two palstaves (NMGW-632296; NMGW-759FC0), a socketed axe (NMGW-75C4F7), and a blade of an uncertain object (NMGW-7621D3).



This hoard can be fairly confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, resolution within this time period however, is problematic and requires metallurgical analysis to resolve.



David Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class I category, which is characterised by a plain collar and narrow blade. Classes of gouges are difficult to distinguish chronologically, but can be broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age, particularly the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (c.1150-750 BC), though different forms continue in use into the Early Iron Age. Savory (1980, 55) has suggested that simple mouth mouldings on socketed gouges suggest a later date within the type, probably implying a Ewart Park date for the gouge, within Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950-750BC.

The implement is incomplete and has broken in antiquity before the blade and has a surviving length of 54.6mm. The piece has been cast in a simple one-piece mould and has undergone no further finishing. At the break the piece has a width of 16.4mm. The sides are curved and diverge sharply to define an expanded blade with a crescentic edge. The implement is flat with a thickness at the break of 4.2mm and 3.2mm at the blade, and weighs 40.1g. Both faces are irregular as would be expected, given that the piece is from the mould. The upper face has a general silver colour, probably because of tin surface enrichment but also has patches of a pale to mid green patina. The underside has a general pale green patina. The implement is an unusual constituent within an assemblage, not least because it has undergone no finishing and may be seen as coming straight from the mould.



A parallel for the piece is from the Acton Park (Wrexham) hoard, where an unusual implement interpreted as a possible chisel was found associated with primary shield pattern palstaves (Savory 1980, No.262 (7), Fig.30). The Acton Park chisel is of similar blade dimensions, is also 'as cast', is flat and has a wide expanded blade. The Acton Park piece however is complete and has flanged sides, since this item has broken before the position of the flanges any identification is speculative. Alternatively, and perhaps more plausibly, this might represent a broken blade of a later tanged chisel, broken below any tang or collar. Tanged chisels are known from a variety of Late Bronze Age contexts such as the hoards from Penwyllt, Powys, and Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No.284(9); No.288(3)).","This object is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975.

The fragment has broken in antiquity and has a surviving length of 74.6mm and weighs 139.8g. The fragment encompasses the upper end of the blade, the stop and the majority of the septum. The septum has a surviving length of 45mm and is broken at an angle. It is possible that the position at the end of the septum is the butt of the palstave, although this can not be demonstrated. The septum is comparatively flat and has a thickness of 6-7mm. Both of the sides are straight for the length of the fragment. The flanges are eroded, but are unlikely to have arched any higher than the maximum thickness at the stop, which is 23.2mm. No loop or remnants are evident on the sides and the casting flashes are no longer visible. The stops are straight and right-angled to the flanges. One of the stops has a large aperture (12mm wide and 13mm deep) as a result of casting problems. The stop is raised above the level of the blade and slopes down to the blade. No decoration is evident on the blade, although one face suggests some hollowing below the stop. The blade side is rounded across its depth. None of the original surface survives on the palstave, which is heavily pitted and has a pale to mid-green patina.","Any identification of type is tentative because of the fragmentary and eroded nature of the axe.

The chisel is complete except for the missing blade edge and has an overall length of 85.5mm and weighs 23.1g. The tang (48mm length) is of square section, which diverges towards the prominent shoulder moulding or 'collar'. At the collar the chisel has a width of 12.3mm, thickness of 8.8mm. The collar moulding has a length of 6mm, converges towards the blade and appears to be slightly concave along its length. The sides of the blade are concave producing an expanded blade edge with a surviving width of 28.2mm. The chisel has a mid-brown patina with some surface survival. Some surface striations are evident on one face and running at an angle across the blade, it is unclear whether the striations are the result of sharpening.","Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period).

117674,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-800,"A fragment of cast bronze axe. The fragment consists of the cutting edge and a small portion of the lower blade of a Mid - Late Bronze Age axe or palstave (1500 - 800 BC). The fragment is D or crescent shaped in plan with a curved convex cutting edge. In section the axe fragment is sub-triangular. The convex cutting edge of the axe fragment, although pitted through corrosion and slightly abraded by the soil, is worn and shows areas of possible sharpening. There is little evidence for the sides tapering inwards above the cutting edge. This is due to a large lateral break which has removed this part of the blade from the rest of the axe-head. This break seems to have occurred relatively recently as the edges are fresh, jagged and show no evidence of abrasion. The area of the break is heavily pitted with small hollows which may have weakened the structure of the blade at this point. The fragment of axe is a dark mid-green brown colour with an even but corroded patina. There are a number of patches of light green powdery (active) corrosion and areas of corrosive pitting present. The area around the break is a mid orange colour; this may be due to the burial conditions or the presence of iron objects in the plough soil. The fragment measures 59.2mm width, 18.7mm length, and is 7.7mm thick. It weighs 21.6 grams. It is very difficult with such a small fragment of metalwork to tell which type of axe it is from; it is most likely to be from either a palstave of Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150 BC) date or a socketed axe of the Late Bronze Age (1150–800BC).",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-10-06T23:00:00Z,,,,21.6,,,7.7,59.2,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Bayston Hill,SJ5109,From finder,52.676474,-2.726155,HESH-A938D2,,HESH-A938D2 illustration.jpg,Bronze Age Axe - Blade fragment,Finder,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-A938D2 illustration.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/89091.jpg

117982,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1275,"Middle Bronze Age copper alloy looped palstave probably dating to c. 1400-1275 BC.



The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 124.85mm. The butt is straight, with a width of 19.76mm and is comparatively thick with a thickness of 5.6mm. The sides are straight and parallel as far as the blade and have a width of 22.7mm. Casting seams are evident on both sides and have been finished. The loop is intact and is a little irregular with a length of 22.32mm (4.72mm internal), a height of 8.30mm and a thickness of 7.49mm. The flanges begin from the septum, before the butt and reach their maximum height (25.94mm) a little before the stop. The septum is concave and has a maximum length of 49mm. The stops are undercut and are straight with rounded corners. The stops have an internal width of 16.3mm (22mm width at the stop) and are 11.7mm high. The stops are raised (5-6mm) above the level of the blade. The blade sides are gradually divergent to the position of the blade facet, where they out-turn to produce a moderately expanded blade with a surviving width of 54.57mm (damage to blade tips). The blade facets begin 11mm from the curving blade edge. The blade is decorated with a high and prominent mid-rib, flanked on each side by a weaker and shorter curving rib. The palstave weighs 273.7g. The surface of the palstave is generally poorly preserved and has been lost on one face. Where the surface survives, the bronze has a black patina, elsewhere the bronze is pale green.","The palstave is a Low-flanged (broad-blade), Group III palstave, probably a variant of either Type Sleaford or Type Carleton, with flanges which begin from the septum and curve to their highest point before the stop. The blade sides are curved to an expanded blade, with uncertain blade tip treatment. The decoration on the face is unusual where the mid-rib is flanked by weaker curving ribs, which may be considered to be a variant of the flange extensions, common on Type Sleaford. 'Low Flanged' palstaves belong to Taunton metalworking stage (1400-1275 cal. BC; Needham et al. 1997), corresponding to Cemmaes metalworking in Wales.

118122,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"A terminal fragment of a Late Bronze Age gold bracelet. It has a surviving length of 38.95mm, probably representing approximately one third of the original length. The 'buffer' terminal is flat and circular with a diameter of 9.66mm to 10.30mm and has a length of 5mm. The bracelet fragment has a minimum width beneath the flaring terminal of 5.79mm. The terminal displays numerous facets, presumably resulting from forging the circular-sectioned terminal. The sides of the bracelet are straight and diverge to the break where the bracelet is comparatively wide for the type at 12.56mm. The bracelet sides are 'worked-up' to form low flanges or lips on both faces with a thickness of 1.51mm (at the break) to 3mm (near the terminal) and are slightly faceted across their thickness. These flanges remain sharp and prominent on the exterior face, but appear lower on the interior of the bracelet, possibly as a result of wear. The 'ribbon' faces have been hammered flat and are plain, with a thickness of 1.1mm at the break and thickening towards the terminal. The break appears to be deliberate and may have been cut and torn to separate; cracks resulting from metal stress are evident near the break. Two incised and roughly parallel lines on the terminal may be contemporary with the use or production of the bracelet. The bracelet fragment has a weight of 10.90g.



Non-destructive semi-quantitative SEM-EDX analysis was carried out by Mary Davis. Five areas on the bracelet were tested; the results varied considerably, depending on the level of wear, damage or scraping beneath the tested area. The gold composition varied between 78% - 97%, silver 2% - 14% and copper 1% - 8%. The scraped and damaged areas show a general composition consistent with similar material from Wales (Taylor (1980); Aldhouse-Green & Northover (1996)) and from Late Bronze Age bracelets from England analysed by Hook & Needham (1989). The depletion of silver and copper on the smooth and worn areas demonstrates a similar effect to other recently analysed prehistoric jewellery thought to have been in contact with the skin, which differs drastically to the analysis of protected and recessed areas on the same artefact.","This form of bracelet has been recognised by Taylor (1984) as a type, which she has termed the 'Potterne Type', after a similar bracelet found at Potterne, Wiltshire. The form corresponds to Hook and Needham's (1989) Class B1 bracelet (which may or may not have the flanges). Hook and Needham list 21 examples of Class B1 and related bracelets from Britain and Europe, with a clear concentration of the type in southern England and with a band stretching across north Wales and Cheshire. This example represents the first recorded example from south Wales.



The parallel from Potterne is of very similar form but is slightly more slender with a maximum width of 8.25mm. Other examples of the Potterne type have been found at Llanarmon-yn-Iân in Denbighshire (Green 1984) where a heavily worn bracelet with smaller terminals but of the same type was found with other gold items (a bracelet, an ingot and a link) and deposited within the socket of a faceted axe of type Gillespie. Excavations at Brean Down, Somerset revealed an associated pair of Potterne Type bracelets and possibly a small fragment from a third. The Brean Down examples are also more slender with maximum widths of 8.2 and 9.2mm. The dating of this bracelet type can be confidently placed in the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7 and dated to 950 - 750BC. The Llanarmon-yn-Iân bracelet was associated with a faceted axe of Ewart Park date, the Potterne find is thought to have been associated with the settlement rather than the midden with a suggested date in the mid 8th century BC. The Brean Down finds may be slightly earlier with a proposed date within the 10th - 9th centuries BC (Bell, 1990 pp71, 108).",3,Gold,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-07-31T23:00:00Z,,,,10.9,,,3,38.95,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Cowbridge with Llanblethian,ST0074,,51.456117,-3.440658,NMGW-E48854,,2005.147.jpg,Late Bronze Age Potterne Bracelet,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.147.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/87958.jpg
118203,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1700,"Incomplete Early Bronze Age bronze developed flat axe (or flanged axe), probably of Class 4E (following Needham forthcoming), corresponding with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) type Bandon and with Type Derryniggin (Harbison 1969) in Ireland. Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase.



The axehead is eroded with very little of the original surface surviving, making it difficult to determine whether the axe is broken or complete. The axe is now comparatively small with an overall surviving length of 66.13mm. The butt is likely to be damaged with a thickness of 7.5mm. The axe has a width of 18.66mm at the butt, which is concave. The sides are convex across their thickness with a maximum thickness (on the blade) of 11.01mm. The sides are fairly straight and slightly divergent before the blade facet, after which they expand sharply to produce a moderately expanded and curved blade edge with a width of 44.45mm. The axe thickens to a point approximately 16mm from the butt, where there is the suggestion of a poorly preserved median bevel, if correct, then this would suggest the axe has lost the butt end. The axe has a width of 19.92mm at the proposed median bevel. The face edges are now eroded but were raised. The blade facet is evident, approximately 20mm from the blade edge. The axe has poor surface preservation and is heavily pitted with a mid green to pale brown patina. The axe currently weighs 98.9g.","The axe can be paralleled with a number of similar axes. Within the National Museum of Wales' collections similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750-1600 BC.



Class 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain. In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known. Several are decorated (e.g. Llanbradig, Isle of Anglesey NMGW-6152E8), but the majority are undecorated.

The bulb of the socket continues right down to the tip of the blade, making the blade look like a circle with wings in section. It tapers to 3.7 mm at the broken tip of the blade. On the blade, either side of the socket bulb is a slight depression running to the tip of the blade. This is apparent on both sides of the blade. 

The Penard phase occurred at the very beginning of the Late Bronze Age, owing some of its stylistic features to Middle Bronze Age technologies. This spearhead is likely to date from circa 1200 to 1050 BC. Similar examples are illustrated in Langmaid (1976, 52; 18a/b).    

This spearhead is in reasonably good condition. It is missing its tip and is a little ragged along the edges of the blade. It also suffers from mild bronze corrosion, but otherwise it has a rich dark green patina. There is an element of scratching on the surface, particularly one side of the socket. As these scratches reveal a different patina to the rest of the artefact it would appear that they are quite recent, and not a result of ancient wear.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Gardening,1985-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,186,,,22.5,201,1,Tom Brindle,Tom Brindle,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,Wellingborough,,SP8769,From a paper map,52.312227,-0.725248,NARC-C411F6,,NARC-C411F6BAspearhead.jpg,Late Bronze Age copper-alloy spearhead of Pennard phase,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-C411F6BAspearhead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/93179.jpg
