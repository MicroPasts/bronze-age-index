The spearhead survives in two pieces, broken across the blade-tang junction. It has a long triangular blade bevelled at the edge, with a rounded midrib and (blade wings with) two distinct steps parallel to the edge of the blade. The central mid-rib is filled, on both sides, with rows of pointille (punched dot) decoration. The tip of the blade is missing and the blade edges are damaged. The junction of the tang and blade is demarcated by an undecorated triangular-shaped facet. The rectangular-sectioned unrivetted tang tapers towards an irregular end which curves slightly upwards. The tang is broken close to the junction with the blade; this is an ancient break. The surface of the spearhead is in poor condition and is partly obscured by corrosion deposits.

It is one of sixteen Type 1B tanged spearheads noted by Davis (2012, 33f.) and is published in his Prahistorische Bronzefunde (Davis 2012, 33, No.29, Plate 3). Two other examples are known from Wales presently (Davis 2012, Nos. 36 and 39). The distribution of tanged spearheads as a whole is concentrated in the south-east of England but examples occur throughout most of Britain and Ireland (Davis 2012, 38; Needham 1979, 7, fig.1.4).

One end of the blade apparently tapers into a tang which is now largely missing. The blade is in poor condition, its tip is bent and its edges are badly damaged and notched. This damage makes it difficult to evaluate whether the apparent tang is a genuine feature or simply a fortuitous break. The blade may possibly be an example of a rare type of Early to Middle Bronze Age knife known as a Class I or 'plantain razor' (Piggott 1946, 122-126, fig.5). The term 'razor' is a slight misnomer as these artefacts were almost certainly not used specifically for shaving but were rather some form of cutting tool.

The rib is not defined by hollows near the stop, as on some early palstaves. The blade is relatively narrow but has a deeply curved edge. The flanges are leaf-shaped and do not extend along the blade. The stop ridge is undeveloped and is only marginally higher than the surface of the blade. The stop is concave with a shallow 'V' shaped profile. Casting problems have led to damage around the butt resulting in a 'V' shaped intrusion, which should not have effected the usefulness of the axe. The casting seams have been removed but remnants are still visible along both sides. The palstave is complete and in very good condition with a consistent light brown patina. The blade has retained its sharp edge and was probably never extensively used. This form of early palstave dates to the Middle Bronze Age c.1500-1200 BC lying in Needham's metalwork stage 5 (Needham 1997). Butler (1963) has suggested that early mid-ribbed and shield pattern palstaves originate from the initial Acton Park phase of Middle Bronze Age metalworking (Northover, forthcoming p130). The blade shape, low stop ridge and side profile (showing a distinction between flange and blade) may suggest a date towards the end of this form and prior to the introduction of the looped palstave.

The closest parallel is an example from Llanfylin, Gwent (Green, 1985) although this axe is longer and more slender. Green (ibid.) argues the Llanfylin axe is best compared with the Chepstow type of Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and is paralleled with the nearby Coed Llan hoard of Early Palstaves (Williams, 1877).

An example of the Aylesham variant of the Meldreth type of facetted socketed axe cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 206-207, nos.1231-1247B, pl.83.","The distribution of Meldreth type socketed axes extends throughout Britain, Ireland and western Europe (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204). As a type they are defined by: slender facetted bodies (the number of facets varying from six to twelve) and trumpet-shaped collars which curve upwards and outwards (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204-205). The shape of the type's socket varies from circular to square in section and the lower part of the collar is variously defined by one or more mouldings, grooves, overhangs or steps (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 205). The variations in the form of the lower part of the collar are used to sub-divide the type. The Aylsham variation includes those axes which have a horizontal moulding, groove or series of grooves at the base of the trumpet-shaped collar (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 206). A local example of a facetted socketed axe which is also an Aylesham variant of the Meldreth type, albeit with a single groove rather then a horizontal moulding at the base of the collar, is known from St Mellons, Cardiff (Savory 1980, 108, no.189. Fig.24). Survey of the associations of Meldreth type axes from northern Britain suggests that the type dates to the late Wilburton and Ewart Park phases (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 209-211). Southern British associations of the type with Stogursey type axes are consistent with this date (I.e. Mc Neil 1973, 49, nos.34-37; see also Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 210). Recent evaluation of the chronology of the British Bronze Age dates the late Wilburton and Ewart Park phases to the period 950-750 BC (Needham 1996, 136-137, fig.1; Needham et al. 1997, 93-98). The deliberate burring over of the flashing marks on just the collar and inside of the loop on the Penllyn axe is notable. It is uncertain how this was achieved, presumably it was ground down with some form of whetstone or abrasive; however, that it was done at all suggests that the collar was functional and, in addition to the loop, accommodated a binding (cf. Orme and Coles 1983, fig.15; Earwood 1993, fig.128). It is possible that the multiple mouldings around the collars of the Meldreth type axes of the Westow variant (i.e. Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 208, nos.1249-1252, pl.84) are skeumorphic representations of collar bindings of the kind suggested above for the Penllyn axe. The typological, and by extension chronological, significance of this observation is uncertain; a significant number of the Meldreth type axes illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess apparently have had the flashing marks on their collar removed (I.e. Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos.1215, 1217, 1219-1230, 1237, 1240, 1242, 1244, 1246-1248, pls.82-83).",3,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2000-03-01T00:00:00Z,,,,147.7,,35,,107.5,1,Philip MacDonald,Philip MacDonald,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9876,,51.473737,-3.470011,NMGW33,,,,,,,

Attempts to subdivide the type on the basis of variation in form have been unsuccessful; graphs plotting indices of shape such as length, width and the ratios of the body width at various points along the length of the axe do not show discrete concentrations (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35). The Gwaelod-y-Garth example is a relatively narrow example of the type. Although most Migdale axes are plain the lower halves of both faces of this example are decorated with a series of incised irregular short dashes which form a 'rain pattern' cf. Harbison 1969, 67, fig.3.D3. Similar decoration is present on Migdale axes from Ystradowen, Glamorgan (Savory 1954-56; Savory 1980, 43,100, no.111, fig.17), Oxwich Bay, Gower (Gwilt and Macdonald 2000) and reportedly Montgomeryshire (Savory 1964-66, 192; Savory 1980, 43, 100, no.108, fig.17). As a type Migdale axes are difficult to date with precision. The typological metalworking stage or assemblage which includes Migdale axes has recently been dated from c.2300BC to c.1900BC (Needham 1996, 130, fig.2). Unfortunately, there is little independent evidence for the dating of decorated examples of the Migdale type, although there is some evidence to suggest that they may date to a late phase of the type's vogue (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 58).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2001-02-01T00:00:00Z,,,,346.1,,,11.5,131.5,1,Philip MacDonald,Philip MacDonald,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Llantwit Fardre,ST1084,,51.547689,-3.299328,NMGW3322,,,,,,,
14678,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1275,"Middle Bronze Age basal-looped spearhead. Length 220mm and 32mm wide across the widest part of the leaf-shaped blade. The socket, encircled by three lightly engraved lines, is 50mm and 16-17mm in diameter at the mouth where it is approximately circular in cross section; further up, the section is sharply angular. Because part of the wooden shaft remains firmly wedged in place it is not possible to known how far the hollow socket extends. There are two neatly formed loops at the base of the blade, one a little larger and lower than the other. The two halves of the mould have been very slightly misaligned and the thickness of the socket metal varies around its circuit. There is a small blow hole in one side of the spine just above the loops. The weapon is not worn or smoothed by the sea and there are stains on the blade which suggest that it had laid until recently in some peaty soil. It is probable, therefore, that it had been recently eroded from coastal peats.



The metal is in good condition with a fairly uniform matt surface of blue/purple colour; nowhere is the patination shiny, which may be an effect of salt water and sand. The edges of the blade have been sharpened in the middle section in antiquity, creating a slightly ragged, thinner edge; the bottom of the socket has also seen a little damage which may have occurred during use. This spearhead falls within Davis' (2012) Type 8A spearhead (flame-shaped blade, incorporated basal-loops) and can be dated broadly to the Taunton phase (1400-1275 BC) (Davis 2012,133-134). It is recorded in Davis' (2012) corpus: No.741, Pl.45. The spearhead can be paralleled in the Taunton hoard itself and in the Stibbard hoard from Norfolk. In Wales the closest parallel is the very splendid weapon from Nebo near Llanrwst which is twice the length but has the same angular socket and essentially leaf-shaped blade (Bezant Lowe 1912, 47; Ellis Davies 1929, 342). A spearhead from the river at Hay on Wye is of similar date but has a rather more complex section across the blade (Savory 1980, 112, fig.27).","The coastal area of Merioneth on either side of the Maddach has produced quite a number of chance finds of bronze implement over the years (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 109-28). The palstave is the main working tool of the period and there are several of both Middle and Late Bronze Age date; but in addition there are a surprising number of weapons. A spear, now lost, from Barmouth had loops on the socket, so probably belonged to an earlier phase than the Tal y Bont one; those from Llanfrathen and Brithir are without loops and belong to the Late Bronze Age. The famous Cwm Moch hoard contains spears with basal loops but a rather more triangular blade which indicates a date in the Penard phase, about 1200 cal BC. This hoard also contains rapiers, the quintessential Middle Bronze Age weapon, soon to be replaced by the leaf-shaped sword which first appears in this phase. Rapiers are rather rare everywhere, but Merioneth has produced another from the Cwm Moch area. Two fine gold torcs (twisted 'neck rings' but long enough to be used as a belt) have been found, one near Harlech and the other on the slopes of Cadair Idris. At a slightly later date a splendid bronze shield was buried in a bog near Gwern Einion and a rare bronze bucket was similarly offered to the gods at Arthog (Bowen and Gresham 1967, 126-7). Coastal Merioneth may therefore be regarded as a region of wealth and splendour in the Bronze Age. The quantity of material is not especially large, but the quality and interest of the pieces is high.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2000-04-20T23:00:00Z,,,,,,,,220,1,F Lynch,Philip MacDonald,Wales,Gwynedd,Gwynedd,Barmouth,SH6217,From a paper map,52.732976,-4.045221,NMGW3325,,,,,,,
14679,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2300,-2050,"Early Bronze Age Flat Axe - probably Class 3.



Dimensions: blade width 57mm, surviving length 86mm, maximum thickness 9.5mm, weight 211.3 grams. 



This axe has slightly concave sides, which diverge gently towards an expanded blade end. The butt of the axe has been broken off in antiquity. There is some evidence that the axe was deliberately damaged; the profile has been slightly bent at the butt end, implying considerable force, and there are linear marks on both butt end surfaces aligned at right angles to the axis of the blade. These would appear to be deliberate blows from a narrow bladed implement, such as another axe. The blade edge is extremely eroded and the axe surface is heavily pock marked, having a green patina, with patches of lighter green carbonate deposit. This may be identified as a bronze flat axe of the Type Migdale/Class 3 belonging to period 2 of the Early Bronze Age (circa 2300 - 2050 cal BC) in Britain (Needham 1983; 1996; Schmidt & Burgess 1981). These are the earliest bronze axes of Britain, which were in use at the same time as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Parallels for this axe, within the National Collection are examples from Usk, Monmouthshire and Whitchurch, Pembrokeshire (Savory 1980, Cat Nos. 106 & 107).","Flat axes are usually found as single finds and separate from settlement and burials of this time. As a consequence, it proves very difficult to date them because of the lack of associations with other material culture and human activity. At present, less than 100 flat axes have been recorded from Wales, spanning a time period from 1500-1900 BC. Therefore each single new find adds significantly to the picture of early metal use here (Gwilt 1999). The probable evidence of deliberate breakage of this axe is interesting, suggesting either breakage prior to recycling and re-smelting or deliberate breakage as part of a ritual involving the burial of the axe within the ground. It is unlikely that a modern plough would have caused such focussed and directional damage to the axe. It is probable that this axe was cast and made in Britain; axes of this shape may be found all over Wales, Scotland and England. In Wales, Bronze Age copper mines have been located and excavated on Anglesey, at the Great Orme, near Llandudno and on Copa Hill Cwmystwyth in mid Wales. However, the earliest radiocarbon dated activity at the Welsh mines belongs to the middle of the Early Bronze Age (circa 1900cal BC), which is after the currency of the Type Migdale flat axe. The earliest copper mining evidence from Northern Europe comes from Ross Island in County Kerry in Western Ireland, with mining occurring between 2500 - 2150BC. However these mines probably supplied ore to make the earliest copper axe types, which are particularly common in Ireland, yet rare in Britain. A mould for making flat axes has been found at Betws-y-Coed, Conwy, showing the technology did exist for flat axe production and casting in Wales, even if the metal source remains speculative.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2000-12-01T00:00:00Z,,,,211.3,,,9.5,86,1,Adam Gwilt,Philip MacDonald,Wales,Bridgend,Bridgend,Cefn Cribwr,SS8781,,51.516584,-3.629929,NMGW3326,,,,,,,
14694,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1650,-1500,"This is a small unlooped palstave of slender form without any form of decoration or ribbing on the upper blade surfaces. Well-defined ledge stops, characteristic of palstaves, are present at mid point along the length of the artefact. Pronounced and asymmetric cast flanges rise at the point of the stops and continue to the butt end. Near to the stop, two notches in the flange profile suggest differential wearing in antiquity, possibly caused by a haft binding. On one side of the axe, one flange is markedly higher than the other, making the palstave sit on an angle when placed upside down on a flat surface. The blade edge has been neatly removed in antiquity, by three blows. These have removed the central and lateral parts of the blade surface, giving a triple 'clipped' shape, and removing the blade at the point where it would have splayed outwards. The artefact has a brown patina and a slightly pitted surface. A number of scrapes and gouges on the blade end of the artefact were probably caused by relatively recent plough damage within the ploughsoil. Dimensions: surviving length 120.0mm, surviving blade width 36.5mm, maximum flange width 22.0mm, weight 200.2 grams. This is an early unlooped palstave belonging to the Acton Park 1 phase (Period 4) belonging to the end of the Early Bronze Age. It may be dated, on current available evidence to between 1650-1500BC (Needham 1996). The palstave is a very early type, representing an intermediate stage between earlier haft-flanged axes and subsequent palstaves proper (the flanges typical of the former and the stops typical of the latter). Northover (unpublished manuscript) has grouped these as of 'intermediate type' with parallels known from Ludlow (Shropshire), Abertillery (Blaenau-Gwent) and Whitchurch (Cardiff). The latter two examples are in the National Collection (Savory 1980, Cat. Nos. 129 & 130, Fig.19), the closest being the example from Whitchurch. The breaking of the blade surface in antiquity, suggests a deliberate rendering of the tool useless, probably as a 'killing' ritual, immediately prior to its deposition.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2000-04-06T23:00:00Z,,,,200.2,,,,120,1,Adam Gwilt,Philip MacDonald,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Welsh St. Donats,ST0277,,51.48343354,-3.41271499,NMGW3340,,,,,,,

Incomplete socketed spearhead with a plain leaf-shaped blade. The two loops no longer survive but sprung from either side of the socket, probably fairly near its base.

41384,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"This record has been updated and reinterpreted 4/5/21 by Peter Reavill with the support of Dr Brendan O'Connor. The original record was made 18 years ago on the original PAS database.





A cast copper alloy short-flanged axehead of Middle Bronze Age date (1600-1250 BC). Unfortunately there is only one view of the axe making the form difficult to be identify specifically to a type or sub-type. The blade is worn and crescentic in shape and the upper blade has a shield pattern directly below the relatively prominent stopridge. This stop ridge is not fused to the side flanges which project slightly beyond the stop and are curled. The butt is squared off with a broken edge. Although the type is difficult to suggest given the presence of a shield pattern it is most likely to be from among the earlier types of flanged axehead, perhaps Cragg Wood dated to the period 1600-1400 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, nos. 462-82) - being attributed to either Acton Park I or Acton Park II metal working assemblages.

The object is a fragment of a possible spearhead. The tip is missing as is the majority of the lower portion. The socket, if there was one, is not visible. In plan the fragment is a sub-triangular shape with a rounded tip and heavily abraded edges. The lower edge is broken, probably quite recently as the patina does not cover this area. In cross section the spearhead is a sub-lozenge shape, however one edge is very abraded. The original existing edge is also slightly more angled forming a shape edge. The patination is heavy and a dark green colour.

Late Bronze Age socketed knife of Thorndon type in good condition. The blade is leaf-shaped, resembling in miniature swords of the period. The blade edge is bevelled on both sides with a slightly concave profile. The socket is oval in section and on the exterior expands at both ends, while the interior is parallel sided. The blade and socket, characteristically for the type, meet at a straight line. There is a circular attachment rivet midway along the socket, the rivet is still in place on one face. Near the rim beneath the handle is a smaller hole, possibly a secondary attempt to secure the handle. On the other face an area of bronze has torn away, the top of the tear corresponds with the secondary hole on the other face and it is a possibility that this tear occurred during the repair. The knife has a brown patination with some of the red-brown soil still adhering to it. There are no visible sharpening striations along the blade.
",Thorndon-type socketed knives were first classified by Hodges (1956) and can be broadly dated to the Ewart Park metalworking phase (c.900-800 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

48833,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1020,-800,"Incomplete ribbed socketed axe of Ewart Park metalworking tradition, dated to 1020-800BC. The axe has lost the mouth, one of the sides and an area of one face. The remainder of the damaged face has been crushed inwards, although it is now difficult to determine if this damage occurred in antiquity. The more complete face demonstrates the remains of two of the three parallel ribs. The mouth and collar of the axe are missing. The loop is also absent, but the remnants of the lower attachment point are evident on the more complete side. The axe would have had an hexagonal body profile, probably with a slightly expanded blade. The casting seam is visible along one side, and appears to have been finished by hammering. The remains of the socket suggest a rounded rectangular profile. The original surface of the axe has been lost, apart from possible small patches of brown-red patination on the incomplete face and in the socket. The surface damage and fragmentary state of the axe make it difficult to assertion the axe type. The ribs and hexagonal body profile suggest a South Wales (or Stogursey) type, of a relatively small example. However, the absence of the mouth and collar moulding make it impossible to be certain.","Socketed axes of a variety of types are prolific in south east Wales as both single and hoarded objects. South Wales axes are the most common, with over 120 examples now known, and have often suffered indicators of deliberate damage such as that seen on the present example. Single, damaged socketed axes are known nearby at Langstone (NMGW162) and Ponthir (PUBLIC-9BD5E6). Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).

Socketed axes of a variety of forms belong to the Ewart Park phase of the British Late Bronze Age (Needham 1981, 32-37). Recently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800BC cal (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2002-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,87,,,19.9,68.7,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Caerphilly,Caerphilly,Rudry,ST2286,,51.567457,-3.126753,NMGW-6D9AD7,,DSCN0434.JPG,Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0434.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5281.jpg

This palstave type is familiarly known as the 'Transitional Palstave', (Smith 1959; Schmidt & Burgess 1981) and is best paralleled in welsh material with the Cammaes hoard and corresponding metalworking tradition. Nortover (forthcoming) has suggested that Cemmaes metalworking is contemporary with the Taunton phase (c.1600-1200BC; Needham et al 1997) in England; although Taunton palstaves are generally of the 'Low-flanged' type, with transitional palstaves generally being of the Penard metalworking stage (c.1400-1000; ibid.) and possibly continuing into the Wilburton metalworking stage (c.1300-1000; ibid.). The palstave has a short butt, which has been damaged in antiquity on one side. This break has occurred through an air bubble in the bronze. The loop is missing, and was placed relatively far back, beginning immediately after the stop. Casting flaws are further evidenced with a hole at the stop on one side. The axe has diverging sides resulting in an expanded crescentic blade edge. The blade has a bevelled edge which begins as the sides significantly diverge. The moulds may have been slightly miss-aligned, resulting in a change of direction in the profile in the sides of the axe. The casting seem on the looped side has not been placed central to the sides. The loss of much of the surface of the axe has made it difficult to decipher the trident design on the faces, the split angular triangular motif against the stop can be made out, but the central rib, can no longer be seen.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2002-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,306.8,,,28.2,114.7,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Newport,Newport,Michaelstone-y-Fedw,ST2384,,51.54961512,-3.11188969,NMGW-71CCA7,,DSCN0519.JPG,Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/krees/DSCN0519.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5294.jpg

Copper alloy socketed side-looped spearhead.



Incomplete short socketed spearhead with a plain kite-shaped blade and central rib defined by the tapering socket. Only one of the side loops survive, and is comparatively shallow. Approximately half of the socket is missing, probably because of erosion. The base of the socket is also missing, but is unlikely to have been very much lower. Only small areas of the original surface survive and the blade edge has also been eroded. The socket retains the remnants of the wooden shaft, and further shaft fragments were displaced when the spear dried subsequent to recovery.
","The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and elsewhere, and is similar to Savory (1980) Nos 227-230. This spearhead has been classified by Davis (2012, 56, No.142) within his 4A (Plain Kite Blade, Long) sub-class. Davis (2012, 55-56) lists 21 examples of this sub-class (incl. the present example), though the Sandfields example is one of only two examples that has side loops close to the base of the socket; the other is from Craigielee, Perth (Davis 2012, No.138). Group 4, as a whole, lacks homogeneity in terms of overall form, and the distribution in Britain is typically more northern, with five findspots known from Scotland (Davis 2012, 58). The type may have some Irish influence (ibid.). The Sandfields spearhead is the only securely provenanced Group 4 spearhead from Wales, though examples are also known from Cheshire and Herefordshire (Davis 2012, Nos.136, 145). Davis (2012, 56) has dated this group to the Acton Park phase in the early stages of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1600-1450 BC).",3,Copper alloy,Wood,,Metal detector,2002-11-01T00:00:00Z,,,,38.3,,17,,101.6,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Neath Port Talbot,Neath Port Talbot,Sandfields West,SS7390,,51.594488,-3.834842,NMGW-2C36F4,,Dscn1130.jpg,Spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn1130.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5409.jpg

Late Bronze socketed axe fragment of Ewart Park metalworking tradition and possibly of South Wales Type. The axe fragment is heavily corroded, with none of the original external surface surviving. The axe has broken in antiquity, and only the bottom blade part is represented. One face has broken at the base of the socket, while the other face is present for approximately a little over half of its original length. The axe is comparatively small and slender, with the sides gently diverging to the blade. No evidence for a splayed blade survives. The more complete face exhibits the remnants of ribs, and appears to have had four (rather than three) parallel or slightly converging ribs. The casting seam may be discerned on both sides, and considering the degree of surface loss, must have been fairly prominent. The blade edge does not survive. The interior of the socket has much better surface preservation and has patches of black colouring, possibly remnants of tenorite.
","Socketed axes of a variety of types are prolific in south Wales as both single and hoarded objects. South Wales axes are the most common, with over 120 examples now known. Examples of both complete and damaged socketed axes in hoards within the National Collection of Wales include St.Mellons, Cardiff (Stanton 1984), Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, no.281) and Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory 1980, no.284).

Socketed axes of a variety of forms belong to the Ewart Park phase of the British Late Bronze Age (Needham 1981, 32-37). Recently, this phase has been radiocarbon dated to 1020-800BC cal (Needham et al. 1997; Needham 1996).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-05-31T23:00:00Z,,,,55.2,,,12.8,52,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Pont-y-Clun,ST0380,From a paper map,51.51057249,-3.39914405,NMGW-E75E26,,Dscn1184.jpg,Socketed axe (inside socket),The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Dscn1184.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/5916.jpg

The dirk has a plain ogival shaped blade with a rounded central rib producing a flattened lozenge cross-section. The butt no longer survives, however the blade size and shape suggest it to be a Group II dirk (Burgess & Gerloff 1981). The butt has corroded to a trapezoidal form, although this should not imply any similarity to the butt when complete. None of the corroded notches around the butt can be positively identified as rivet holes, however it is tempting to see the arc near the top of the dirk as the possible remnants of a rivet hole. The condition of the dirk is generally poor with large areas of the surface missing, and has an orange-brown patination.","Most dirks of group II can be confidently ascribed to Acton Park metalworking tradition although occasional examples have been found associated with Taunton phase metalwork (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, p44-45).

51789,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1700,"Decorated developed flat axe, probably of Class 4E (following Needham forthcoming), corresponding with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) type Scrabo Hill and with Type Ballyvalley (Harbison 1969) in Ireland. Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase. This axe has the general shape of Type Glenalla, being long and narrow, but has the straight and slightly diverging sides characteristic of Type Scrabo Hill. The axe probably had a comparatively straight and thin butt and straight sides which diverge gradually up to a point near the blade corresponding to the beginning of decoration on the face, after which the sides turn out sharply to the expanded crescentic blade edge. The sides are worked up forming low, poorly defined flanges and are decorated with a hammered elliptical design. The faces are flat with a weak, slightly curved median bevel, the position of which approximately corresponds with the edge of the decoration. The blade has one well defined blade facet, and the blade edge has been lost. The decoration is concentrated on the blade and is composed of oblique chiselled regular strokes of 'rain' pattern confined at the top and bottom by two tight rows of opposing diagonals forming a herring-bone motif within a punched dot border, and on the sides by a single column of tight diagonals outside a punched dot column. The diagonal markings edged by punched dots extend up both sides with a single column in the centre, which ends well before the butt. The axe is in good condition with much of the surface surviving on one face, but fairly extensive pitting on the other face.","Axes of this type have a predominantly Irish distribution with a concentration in the northern half of the country (Harbison 1969); Harbison notes 846 Irish examples of Type Ballyvalley in his catalogue (ibid). The axe can be paralleled with an example found near Ballina, Co. Mayo (No 825, ibid.), which has similar decoration and is of similar dimensions, but differs in the fact that the example has two blade facets.



However, Class 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain (Needham 1983). In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known though none with comparable decoration. A 4E axe from Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, is decorated with small strokes in vertical and horizontal bands across the axe faces (Needham 1983, Fig.40.1), while one from Overton, Wrexham (NMGW-4596D8) is described as having a raindrop pattern. The flanges of a 4E axe found at Knighton, Powys (PUBLIC-905653), are decorated with a herringbone pattern.



A smaller, but similarly decorated 4E axe is known from Suffolk, which possessing cable decorated flanges and a panel of incised chevron decoration on both faces below a median bevel (Needham 1983, Fig.39, Sf 32).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-04-30T23:00:00Z,,,,447.8,,,14.1,150.5,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Llanbadrig,SH3692,From a paper map,53.399277,-4.468163,NMGW-6152E8,,DSCN1424.JPG,Bronze Age Developed flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1424.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/7747.jpg

The palstave has a narrow form and is parallel sided at the rear, extending as far as the beginning of the blade. The blade sides gradually diverge to a point corresponding to a blade facet on the face, after which it expands into wide blade producing a deep crescentic blade edge. Remnants of the casting seams are visible on both sides. The butt is concave and the flanges at the rear of the axe are straight as far as immediately before the straight stop. The blade thickness is shallower than the flanges, producing a gradient from the blade to the stop. The stop on one face extends beyond the height of the flanges. The sides of the face on the blade have low flange extensions, which continue as far as the blade facet, as does the single rib on each face.","Dating early palstaves remains problematic, Norhtover (forthcoming) has stated that Group II palstaves belong to the earlier stages of Acton Park (or Acton Park 1), and Needham (1996) argues that no true metalwork assemblage can be defined as Acton Park 1 and groups Acton Park 2 with Taunton in his Period 5 (1500-1150 BC), Needham's (1996) C14 dating of a broad-bladed shield pattern palstave, however, was dated to 1 sigma to 1610-1420 BC (OXA -4651). Northover (forthcoming) notes the composition of some Liswerry palstaves, including Liswerry itself produced signatures consistent with Taunton phase metalworking (c. 1350-1200 BC) The distribution of early midribbed palstaves in Wales and the Marches is generally south eastern in contrast to a mainly northern distribution of shield pattern palstaves.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-05-31T23:00:00Z,,,,371.9,,,33.6,151,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Llanbadrig,SH3692,From a paper map,53.399277,-4.468163,NMGW-61A406,,DSCN1421.JPG,Palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN1421.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/7746.jpg

52830,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"The palstave appears to have lost about 20mm from the butt in antiquity, but in other respects is in very fine condition, though beginning to lose small patches of its fine patinated surface, especially around the sharp recurved blade.  The surviving length is 130mm, probably originally 148mm; the width of the blade is 65mm, of the septum 25mm, and the depth of the flanges is 28mm.  The face view has an essentially straight septum and wide blade; the side view a smooth curve from blade to flange.  The ledge stop is approximately square in face view and there is a hollow at the base of the septum on each side.  There is no ‘nick’ at the junction of flange and blade, a design feature of several early palstave types, but here the reminisence of the earlier flanged axe design lies rather in the slight extension of the flanges below the stop.  On both faces there is a rounded swelling below the stop.  This is perhaps a variant of the ""shield pattern' seen on so many Welsh palstaves, but it is not defined by a raised moulding.
     
     The piece has been competently cast and the casting seams have been ground down, but a slight misalignment of the two valves of the mould has meant that a small area on the side has not received the fine polish that is evident on the rest of the surface.  This accident demonstrates the effort that had been made to create the fine dark surface and raises the question of the extent to which particular colour and surface effects might be deliberate.  There is evidence of neat horizontal hammering underlying the polished surface on the blade facet.  The hammer or punch used was rectangular, 5 x 2mm.","It is a particularly interesting piece for two reasons; it belongs to a relatively rare group of early unlooped palstaves which are characteristic of mid-Wales and arguably ancestral to the established palstaves of the influential Acton Park Complex in north Wales; and its exceptionally finely polished black surface raises questions about the possibility of deliberate patination of such pieces.
     
     The closest parallel to this piece is a very slightly larger palstave found in the nineteenth century at Clochfaen near Llangurig (Mont) which has been used to exemplify a sub-group of the early shield pattern palstaves (Williams 1895, 243 no.5; Chitty 1949; Burgess 1964).  It has the appropriate proportions, less clumsy than the true Acton Park type, with a wide splayed blade and narrow smooth flanges seen from the side.  The Clochfaen palstave has a shield moulding on only one face so its absence on the Maerdy example does not preclude its association with the Clochfaen Group.  Other members of the group (now re-named 'Llandderfel' (Northover unpublished catalogue)) are found in Anglesey and Gwynedd (7), Denbighshire/Flintshire (3) and Cheshire/Shropshire/Montgomery (7 + this new one); only 4 have come from Glamorgan and the southern Marches.

The swords have been deliberately broken into fragments so that they can be easily melted down. One fragment appears to have already been subjected to intense heat and is partially melted. 

    
    There are two large pieces of sword blade. Both are lentoidal in section and have a pronounced line along each cutting edge. One fragment measures 100.78mm  by 31.85mm and is a maximum of 6.29mm thick. The other is 104.2mm by 40.44mm and is a maximum of 6.73mm thick. There are two further sword blade fragments. One measures 73mm by 36.25mm and is 5.83mm thick; the other measures 27.15mm by 36.18mm and is 4.97mm thick.

    
    There are also two fragments of sword handles. The larger of the two fragments measures 63.21mm by 37.84mm and is 3.36mm thick. It has marginal ribs running down its edges and two circular perforations. One is filled with iron corrosion. This suggests that at least this fragment can be dated to the cusp between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (c. 600BC). The other sword handle is more corroded. It is similar in shape and measures 32.98mm by 40.57mm and is 4.71mm thick. The circular rivet hole can be seen on the broken edge of the handle.

54030,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1700,"Small developed flat axe or cast-flanged axe, probably of Class 4E (following Needham forthcoming), corresponding with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) type Bandon and with Type Derryniggin (Harbison 1969) in Ireland. Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase. The axe appears to have lost the majority of its original surface, and problems in identifying surface detail are further enhanced by a thick coating of glossy varnish applied by the finder. The butt is thin and rounded and both sides are slightly concave and curve outwards to the blade tips to define an expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The flange facets are comparatively low, and define thin-pointed oval.sides. A stop is now only barely discernible on one face, and is positioned approximately mid way along the axe. Blade facets are evident on both faces. No decoration is discernible on any of the faces or sides.","The axe can be paralleled with a number of similar, but slightly larger axes, found near the findspot (NMGW unpublished records). Within the National Museum of Wales' collections similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750-1600 BC.



Class 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain, with examples similar to the Llandow axe known from Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire (Needham 1983, Ca 8, Ca 10, Li 15/2). In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known. Several are decorated (e.g. Llanbradig, Isle of Anglesey NMGW-6152E8), but the majority are undecorated.

The casting jet is corroded, but displays the remnants of the characteristic four runners used to produce the South Wales Type axe during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age. The upper face of the jet is flat, while the lower face is irregular and concave, with the remnants of the four projections. The jet is of irregular oval shape and does not have a central aperture, it is of a light - mid brown colour with very little of the original surface surviving.","The casting jet was found associated with a ribbed socketed axe blade fragment (NMGWPA 2003.144.1; NMGW-B88605) and is similar in condition and colour to the axe fragment. The four-runner casting technology of the jet may lend further weight to the suggestion that the axe fragment is from a South Wales Type axe. The association of contemporary artefacts suggest the metalwork forms a small hoard deposited during the Late Bronze Age and is therefore likely to constitute Treasure under the revision of the Treasure Act 1996. Four-runner casting jets have recently been identified and recorded in a number of hoard discoveries in South Wales, including the St Nicholas, Cowbridge, and Brigam Farm metalwork hoards.

Complete, but damaged Late Bronze Age plain socketed axe-head. The axe is comparatively long and slender in form. The mouth is somewhat circular, but the socket profile is sub-square and the axe has a sub-rectangular body section. The collar is simple and flared with no mouldings. The mouth-edge surface no longer survives, but the axe was likely to have been cast using a two-runner casting technique. The loop (now broken) is slight and of oval-section, springing from the underside of the collar, and gently arcs back to the side. The sides are straight or slightly concave before they recurve to the blade end. The casting seams are clear on both sides and have been neatly finished, probably by abrasion. The blade end has been damaged, but would have been expanded and curved. Both faces have clear hammered-marks on the lower third of the axe. Sharpening striations running along the blade edge are visible on both faces. One face has many striations running along the length of the axe, but it is unclear if these are deliberate or from antiquity. The axe is in comparatively good condition with a dark green patina, but with areas of damage at the mouth and blade. The top of the axe has a patchy black coating or deposit, possibly tenorite.
","The axe is likely to be an early socketed axe, probably of Wilburton type and metalworking tradition, and dating to c. 1100 - 950BC.

The axe is of South Wales (Stogursey) Type and is typical of Ewart Park axe heads found in south east Wales. The axe is comparatively short and squat. The socket is sub-rectangular, within an irregular mouth, clearly showing remnants of all four casting runners. The loop is of lozenge section and begins immediately beneath the simple angled collar moulding. The sides curve gently to a slightly expanded blade, producing a curved blade edge. The casting seams shows signs of finishing, probably by hammering, although they seem unfinished near the top of the axe on the unlooped side. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, which appear high and crisp. The sides of the face have a suggestion of enhancing, possibly to resemble ribs. The blade on the better preserved face shows evidence of hammering and sharpening striations near the blade edge. The blade edge has been lost through damage.","South Wales axes and variants are prolific in south east Wales with over 120 examples now known as single finds and in hoards.

Liss-type bracelets are characterised by the form of the incised decoration. This example has at least three, but probably more zones of geometric decoration consisting of zig-zags made up of three or four lines with dotted borders divided by wide bands of cross-hatching. There is a cord motif on the lower edge with a row of dots above it. The bracelet, which has an internal diameter of 60mm, an external diameter of 85mm and a width of 18mm has a sub-triangular section with a convex outer edge and a pointed apex inwards. The surfaces are heavily pitted and much of the decoration is missing. Signs of bronze disease.



Bracelets of this type and other mid-Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' artefacts are not common finds. These bracelets concentrate in the southern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and West Sussex and examples are also known from Suffolk and Norfolk. Incised decorated bracelets form part of a North European tradition, which has led to the suggestion that the examples from southern England may be imported from northern France, although this theory has been questioned (O'Connor 1980). While some of the known bracelets come from hoards containing items such as torcs, pins, axes, palstaves and other mid-Bronze Age artefacts, no other objects were found in association with this example.

59228,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"Bronze palstave axe dating to the early Middle Bronze Age, and probably of Taunton or Cemmaes metalworking tradition, Needham et al. (1996) Period 5; c. 1500-1150 BC. The palstave is of an early type and is unlooped, and is also without either a shield pattern or a mid-rib on the blade. The palstave would appear to belong to Group III palstaves of Low-Flanged (Broad-Blade) form, the lack of cast blade decoration on this example makes it difficult to categorise to a specific type, but would appear to be dated to c. 1350-1200BC.  
  The palstave is relatively slight, compared to the more massive Acton Park type. The sides are parallel as far as the stop, and then gradually diverge to a slightly expanded blade. The blade edge is gently curved with a long (14mm) blade facet. The blade sides have been pronounced on the upper blade, forming low ribs. The bar stop is straight and meets the flange at a right angle; on the blade side, the stop is near vertical before arcing to the blade face and forming a ‘bar ledge stop’. The flanges are low, as defined by the type, and diverge laterally to a diagonal step before the stop. The butt is eroded, but seems to have had a V-shaped nick. The sides are slightly rounded and convex. The casting seams are discernible but largely eroded. One side appears wider on one half of the mould side than the other. Much of the surface of the palstave has been lost, but survives to a greater extent on one face and appears to have a black patchy coating or patina.","The palstave is of particular interest because of the unusual absence of cast decoration on the face, and together with the lack of a loop, possibly suggests an earlier date within the type. The relatively sophisticated form and profile however may hint at a slightly later date. Whilst Low-Flanged palstaves are not uncommon finds from the welsh Middle Bronze Age (some 120 recorded examples), a palstave without the characteristic ornament or loop makes the find of archaeological interest and difficult to parallel with known examples.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2003-12-01T00:00:00Z,,,,309.2,,,26.6,122.7,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Angle,SM8503,From a paper map,51.684491,-5.111647,NMGW-22B071,,DSCN2037.JPG,Palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2037.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/17734.jpg

Needham (1996) grouped Acton 2 metalwork with Taunton and Penard as his Period 5 (c. 1500-1150BC), It could be suggested that this example falls in the earlier section of this date range.

The palstave is complete, but has lost much of the original surface, particularly on one face. The butt is straight and meets the sides at a right-angle. The sides are parallel as far as the stop, and then gently diverge and turn out sharply at the blade tips. The flanges are curved and define a pointed oval with the blade sides. Both sides exhibit the remnants of prominent broad casting flashes and one of the flanges has a prominent casting flaw. The blade edge is deeply curved. The septum is slightly rounded, and unusually, the stop is different on each face. The face with more of the surface surviving has a straight stop, which meets the flange facets in a right-angle, while the other face has a rounded U-shaped stop. The better preserved face has the suggestion of a very slight poorly defined mid-rib. The blade faces are flat with no working up at the sides, but have a slight depression before the blade facet. The blade is notably asymmetrical, with one blade tip positioned further back than the other. It is possible this may be the result of differential wear on the blade through use.","This example can be best paralleled with numbers 795-6 (pp 127, plate 58) in Scmidt & Burgess' catalogue (1981).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2001-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,464.2,,,31.8,153,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Abergavenny,,,,,NMGW-C905E7,,DSCN2157.JPG,Palstave (side),The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2157.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/20295.jpg

62531,Halberd,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2400,-2000,"
This is a symmetrical slender halberd blade of cast copper or bronze. Down the centre of the blade is a straight midrib. This is wide and angular in cross-section, at the top end tapering with a straight line into the haft-plate. The blade edges have been entirely removed, thus also removing any traces of bevelling originally along the edge. Whilst much of this damage is due to erosion of fragile edges, it is possible that some edges were notched through use wear or mutilation prior to burial. The erosion seems particularly deep and severe, with concave eroded depressions side by side, creating a 'nibbled' effect in places along the blade edge, almost as if notches were later prone to differentially high erosion. The blade end is blunt. The haft-plate is also heavily eroded, though is angular rather than rounded in shape. The halberd reveals evidence of four rivet holes, positioned as two lateral pairs on the haft-plate (rather than being arranged in an arc along it). The lower two are complete, whilst the upper two are visible only as partial grooves along the line of the eroded hilt-plate edges. The whole blade has been bent, as viewed in side section, probably in antiquity, there being no evidence of modern impact. The blade remains sturdy, yet is pitted across its surfaces. The overall patination is green, yet the eroded pits have a light green patina.
","Halberds have recently been reassessed by Needham (2015) and a new typology presented for the British series. This halberd was published within Needham's paper (Cat.No.20) and falls within Type Pistill Dewy, which is characterised by four rivets in a trapezoidal formation following the hilt (Needham 2015, Appendix S1, p.23). Only four or five examples are currently known from Britain and this style may be linked with French influence.",3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by a museum - not a Treasure case,Unknown,1995-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,361.5,,,7.5,284,1,Adam Gwilt,,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Hundleton,SM9501,From finder,51.670273,-4.966024,NMGW-87E225,,Halberd.jpg,Bronze Age halberd,National Museum Wales ,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/Halberd.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/626227.jpg
