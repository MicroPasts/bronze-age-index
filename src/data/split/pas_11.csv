727206,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-600,"
An unidentifed copper-alloy object of probable early Iron Age or perhaps late Bronze Age date and of uncertain original extent. The object comprises a short arc which merges into a straight section, with a swelling where the two lengths join. The lower side of the swelling and the two present terminals all have pronounced hollows each of which is orientated along the length of the object. Both terminals expand. The curving length appears plain but is corroded and is possibly decorated with a line of dots. The straight length is decorated on three sides with a band of repeating punched linear curving indentations. The central swelling is decorated on one side with cast raised concentric circles; the opposite side is plain and flat. A short ridge on the inner face of this swelling separates it from the curved end.

727558,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of five objects.




1. Penannular ring (PRN 32821)
Maximum external diameter (side to side) 19.5mm; maximum diameter of bar (top to bottom) 6.3-6.5mm; weight 18.75g.



This is a complete and small penannular ring decorated with a silvery gold inlayed strip. The ring is of solid gold bar construction and was made of a straight, round sectioned bar, which was bent round into a penannular shape. Around the gold core, a silvery strip was inlaid in continuous spiral fashion to provide a striped colour effect, with seven stripes around each face. The silvery gold stripes are relatively wide, 1.3mm wide on the interior side and 3.0-3.5mm wide on the exterior surface. They are visible as darker areas of surface pitting, caused by the differential corrosion of the silver within this alloy. One side of the ring has been differentially worn during its life and the inset stripes of silvery gold have completely worn away, exposing continuous areas of gold. Some striations on the outer surfaces of the penannular ring were probably caused after burial and during more recent disturbance in the soil.




2. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 63.3mm; maximum surviving width 60.9mm; maximum thickness

31.2mm; surviving weight 412.8g.



Sizeable fragment of ingot with worn upper and lower surfaces and rounded worn breaks. The lower surface is convex in shape and the upper surface is relatively flat. No edge sections are apparent, but distinct thinning evident in two areas in side-section, suggesting areas approaching edges of ingot. Some interior vesicles evident along breaks. Brown patination with areas of green mottling visible.



3. Small ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 39.6mm; maximum surviving width 28.7mm; maximum surviving thickness 14.8mm; surviving weight 53.0g.



Small and irregularly shaped copper alloy fragment, with no clear evidence of original ingot shape. One surface is convex, the other irregular. All surfaces and breaks are worn. Patches of brown patination within overall grey green patination.



4. Ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 30.2mm; maximum surviving width 29.2mm; maximum surviving thickness 14.9mm; surviving weight 37.9g.



Small and irregularly shaped copper alloy fragment, with no clear evidence of original ingot shape. One surface is reasonably flat, the other irregular. All surfaces and breaks are worn. Vesicles visible in side breaks. Patches of grey green patination within overall brown patination.



5. Spatulate ended tool (PAS 2013/028/001)



Length 79.5mm; width of spatulate end 5.3mm; weight 25.3g.



This is a square-sectioned copper alloy tool with a flat top. It tapers and thins at the opposite end, in both planes, expanding again slightly to form a spatulate shaped working end. This has a rounded, but asymmetric end profile. The tool bends in side view, from near the midpoint along its length and towards the spatulate shaped working end. Surfaces are etched with a brown patination and there are localised surface grey-green coloured corrosion patches.



The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (e.g. Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).



It is possible to be confident that the large ingot fragment (No. 2 above) is part of a plano-convex ingot or cake of Late Bronze Age date. Its convex underside, thinning to margins indicating an oval shape in plan view and of a size consistent with others viewed, together with the presence of interior vesicles, provide some morphological support for this identification. Moreover, metallurgical analysis has demonstrated the ingot to be of copper with a small lead component and trace antimony and arsenic presences, again consistent with other recently tested Late Bronze Age ingot discoveries from west Wales. Its worn surfaces and breaks suggest that the ingot was disturbed from its original burial context by recent farming activity, having eroded at a shallow depth (10-13cm) within a cultivated and aerated soil for some time. The same disturbed and dispersed location is likely to be true for the penannular ring, also found at shallow depth (7-8cm). However, being of gold, this artefact was not prone to erosion and corrosion in the same way.



The two probable small ingot fragments (Nos. 3 & 4) are not large enough to retain diagnostic morphological features, permitting certain identification as plano-convex ingots in their own right. However, the presence of interior vesicles and very similar worn state is consistent with the larger ingot fragment, and their geographical location within the same field and less than 200m apart do tend to support their identification as probable small plano-convex ingot fragments of Late Bronze Age date. Their metallurgical composition - copper with small lead components and trace antimony and arsenic presences - is also the same as that of the large ingot fragment (No. 2), providing further supporting evidence for this interpretation. Their dispersal from each other and the penannular ring and their worn state also suggest relatively recent disturbance from the original burial context, and erosion at shallow depths (10-13cm) within a cultivated and aerated soil.



Cake ingots are known in hoards of the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-950 BC), with examples from Wales found within the Guilsfield, Powys hoard (Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38). However, plano-convex ingots of copper and bronze are much more common components of Ewart Park hoards of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). Over 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan 1 and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex bronze ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004b; 2008). In the light of the dating evidence for plano-convex ingots, the combined evidence suggests that the penannular ring and ingots were probably buried together as a hoard during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). In other words, both penannular rings and plano-convex ingots were being made and in circulation at this same time.

The spatulate ended tool (No. 5 above; PAS (GAT) 2013/028/001) with a square-sectioned shaft, discovered and reported subsequently to the penannular ring and ingots and from the north east corner of the same field, has proven impossible, at the current time, to relate and parallel with similar artefacts of demonstrable Late Bronze Age date. Metallurgical analysis has indicated it is made of copper, with a significant presence of bismuth. While copper is potentially consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, the presence of bismuth at the levels seen is felt to be anomalous for this period, making a post-medieval date more likely. On the current balance of evidence, this artefact cannot be confidently interpreted as once a directly associated and a contemporary component of this Late Bronze Age hoard.



~~The spatulate ended tool (No. 5) cannot, on the balance of the evidence available, be associated with the hoard: no close Late Bronze Age parallels can be found, while its metal composition does not match the ingots (Nos. 2-4) or the common signature of Late Bronze Age artefact signatures. Therefore, it is my opinion that this object cannot be considered as treasure.","Metallurgical analysis (MD & AG)



Results



The penannular ring had a composition of approximately 78.5% gold, 17.5% silver and 3% copper.

The three ingot fragments were found to be of copper, with small lead components and trace arsenic and antimony presences. The spatulate ended tool was of copper, with a presence of bismuth detected.



Interpretation



The composition of the penannular ring was consistent with comparable Middle to Late Bronze Age gold compositions, with small amounts of copper deliberately alloyed with the gold at this time to improve its colour properties. The approximately 3% of copper detected suggests it registered from within the gold and is consistent with the suggestion that the ring is of solid gold bar construction.



Copper with a small lead component is a typical composition for plano-convex ingots of Late Bronze Age date and paralleled in many Late Bronze Age hoards containing an ingot component. The absence of zinc within any of the ingots provides no evidence to support a Roman or later date of manufacture.



The level of bismuth registering within the spatulate ended tool is regarded as being too high for a metal of Late Bronze Age date. This composition is more characteristic of an artefact and technology of probable post-medieval date.",3,Gold,Copper alloy,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-05-15T23:00:00Z,,2013TW13,,,,,,,5,Adam Gwilt,Adam Gwilt,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Cwm Cadnant,SH5875,From a paper map,53.25295572,-4.12991271,NMGW-04216C,,DH007017_01.jpg,"Late Bronze Age hoard from Cwm Cadnant Community, Anglesey",National Museum Wales ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH007017_01.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/521622.jpg
727618,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of two ribbed socketed axes.



1. Ribbed socketed axe - Croxton Type / Class B Southern English ribbed axe



Dimensions: maximum length 102.9mm; blade width 51.3mm; combined weight (including socketed axe fragment 2) 420.8g.



This is a complete and slender socketed axe with a flared trumpet shaped mouth and a wide collar band. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section with slightly concave sides expanding to a widened and curved cutting edge. The mouth of the axe is deep, front to back, and of sub-rectangular shape with curved corners. The mouth tops surface is flat with no clear indication of runner stubs or scars. Two ribs and two edge ribs, all near parallel, descend from the base of the collar band, extending approximately half way down the axe faces. A wide loop descends from the lower side of the collar band, while the casting seams have been carefully removed, probably by filing and hammering down each side of the axe. On the blade bevel, surface striations parallel to the cutting edge are evident, indicating the blade was sharpened for use. The axe has a brown patina. Localised patches of blue coloured surface corrosion are evident on one face, raising the possibility that the axe burnt immediately before being placed in the ground.



2. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - South Wales Type socketed axe (wedged into socket of axe 1)



Dimensions: maximum surviving length in the range of 53-57mm (not precisely ascertainable); surviving external width at mouth 31.3mm; combined weight (including socketed axe 1) 420.8g.



This is a mouth, upper face and side fragment of a broad socketed axe with a rectangular cross-section, which has been deliberately forced into the socket of axe 1 (above). The axe has a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding with a flat top. Two projecting runner stubs are evident on the mouth top surface, one located down the mid face section and the other down the mid side section (i.e. at 90 degrees to each other). Two, widely splayed ribs are evident on this partial face fragment, descending from the underside of the mouth and down the face of the axe. A prominent casting seam is evident down the non-loop side of this axe, indicating minimal finishing after casting. The axe fragment has a grey-green coloured patina.","The complete socketed axe (No. 1 above) may be identified as of Croxton Type, also known as a particular form of Class B - Southern English ribbed axes (Northover unpublished, 267; Needham 1990, 32-8). The Croxton type, with its diagnostic flaring trumpet mouth, deep collar band and ribs is so named after a defining example found in Cheshire, within a wider frequency observed along the Welsh Marches (Northover unpublished, 267). It is one form within a wider variety of Class B ribbed axes, found in hoards and as single finds across southern Britain. They are almost always found within hoards dating to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Croxton Type socketed axes have been found in increasing numbers of hoards across south east Wales in recent years, with examples in the Pendoylan, Llantwit Major, Wick, Tal-y-garn 1 and Colwinston (Vale of Glamorgan) hoards and an additional example from the St Arvans (Monmouthshire) hoard (Storrie 1887; Fox 1926; GGAT 1977-8; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, Cats. 280 & 281; 1984, 441b; Northover unpublished, H79 & H124; Gwilt 2004, Appendix 1, Cat. 10; Gwilt & Lodwick 2003; 2004; Lodwick & Gwilt 2007; Gwilt et al 2013a).



The fragmentary socketed axe (No. 2 above) wedged into the socket of the complete axe may be identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of pronounced out-splayed mouth, four-runner casting technology, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over thirty hoards now contain at least 140 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4;; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



The forcible ramming of artefact fragments into the sockets of axes is a widespread phenomenon in Britain during the Late Bronze Age. In south east Wales, the recently discovered Cowbridge, Tal-y-garn 2 and Colwinston, Vale of Glamorgan hoards, all of Ewart Park tradition, all show similar practice (Lodwick 2003; Lodwick & Gwilt 2003; Gwilt 2004, 122; Gwilt et al 2013a). It is likely that this represented a social practice involving the deliberate destruction or symbolic killing of objects, immediately before they were placed in the ground.",3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-12-18T00:00:00Z,,2013TW26,,,,,,,2,Adam Gwilt,Adam Gwilt,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llancarfan,ST0471,From a paper map,51.42984351,-3.38229101,NMGW-14B441,,DH007018_04.jpg,A Late Bronze Age hoard,National Museum Wales ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/DH007018_04.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/521653.jpg
727751,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1000,"An incomplete copper alloy palstave fragment of the Middle Bronze Age, dating c. BC 1600  to c.BC 1000.



Around 25% of the palstave is present, consisting of the butt of the axe. The fragment is broadly trapezoidal in plan with a broadly H shaped cross section. Both front and reverse faces are concave which denote the beginnings of the raised flanges, which taper out towards the break. No traces of decoration are visible. Both the front and reverse faces show signs of wear and there are areas of the patina missing. The break appears to be patinated suggesting object was broken in antiquity. 



The fragment measures 26.0 mm in length and is 24.7 mm wide (at the break) and 22.5 mm (at the butt end). It has a thickness of 7.8 mm (at the break) and 4.9 mm (at the butt end). It weighs 23.7 g. 



The fragment is a mid to dark green in colour, with the front face being dark green and the reverse is mid green, with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail, and damage to the remaining patina.



Due to the fragmentary nature of the object it is difficult to assign type. However the fragment does appear indicative of a Palstave axe rather than a developed axe.

728533,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-800,"Late Bronze age copper alloy sword fragment, 47mm wide, 35mm high and 13mm thick with a weight of 57.18grams. The fragment is very abraided and consists of a triangular fragment with an eliptical cross section and represents part of a handle and blade of a sword. The object consists of two seperate pieces of metal, the blade and the handle fragment which surrounds it. When viewed from above the blade, 35mm long, has a narrow eliptical cross section which becomes narrower and thicker as it travels through the handle, until it has an oval cross section as viewed from below.

The blade is surrounded by the upper part of the handle. On both sides, the upper edge of the handle drops down and inwards from each end forming a semi-circular depression in its centre and creating sub-rectangular &#39;projections&#39; at each side. It also tapers in width, narrowing towards the present base, to accomodate the users hand. On each side of the handle, centrally placed in the projections are &#39;dummy&#39; rivets. These are positioned to correspond with those on the opposite side and one set are slightly deeper set than the others (The rough sketch attached shows the position of the &#39;dummy&#39; rivets).

Neil Wilkin has identified the fragment as &#39;belonging to a relatively small group of British swords with &#39;solid&#39; bronze hilts rather than organic ones (Burgess &amp; Colquhoun 1981, 122, no. 751-5), including a recent discovery from Cherry Burton, Yorkshire (YORYM-958D05).

730123,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A copper alloy Middle Bronze Age spear (spearhead) dating from about 1550 - 1250 BC. The spear has a very short and rounded leaf shaped blade, and two side loops on the socket; Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'.



The blade of the spear appears to be complete but it is unusually small at 37.4mm long and 24.6mm wide. The edge facets are about 3mm wide. The midrib continues to the very tip of the blade. It forms a pronounced rounded rib on each face. It can be described as conical, but is a little taller than it is wide.



There is 17mm between the base of the blade and the side loops. These are quite flat and have expanded pointed oval outer faces to the loops. The loops are 22.5mm long, 12mm wide and project 8mm from the shaft. Internally the loops are about 2mm wide and 7mm long. The casting seams are still visible between the loops and the blade but have been carefully trimmed. They are not visible between the loops and the mouth of the socket.



The mouth is circular and is 19.5mm external diameter. The walls are 2.8 - 3mm thick. The socket can be measured to at least 65.3mm deep. It tapers smoothly into the midrib.



The spear has a smooth tan brown patina with some slight pitting. Overall, it is 86mm long, 24.6mm wide, 18.8mm thick and is 57.81g.



Side-looped spearheads are Class IV and date from the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, about 1500-1150 BC. GLO-F69302 is a similarly shaped example. Davis (2017) suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'.

732076,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Incomplete, copper alloy, side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of probably the Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1500 - c. BC 1150.


Most of the spear remains but the tip, side loops and the bottom half of the base are missing.


The spearhead is sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade, hollow socket and the remains of two cast side loops. The blade (sides and tip) of the spearhead is incomplete having been damaged in the ploughsoil. Therefore, accurate dimensions of the blade length and width cannot be given. The surviving blade measures 44.01 mm in length, and is 28.7 mm wide. Along the centre of the blade is a lozenge (oval) shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear. The socket is sub-oval in cross section and expands evenly along its length. The base of the socket has been damaged and broken, the internal diameter is approximately 12.2 mm. The internal length of the socket is 43.8 mm which suggests that it may extend a short distance into the midrib of the blade. The remains of the two loops are located on either side at the base of the socket, they remain as two oval shaped lugs one on top of the other, evenly spaced, on either side. These two loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. 

The spear measures 71.8 mm length, has a maximum width of 28.7 mm and maximum thickness of 14.5 mm. The blade has a thickness of 9.1 mm, and the wall of the socket is 2.7 mm thick. The spearhead weighs 41.7 grams. 

The spearhead is a dark-brown green colour. Originally it would have had a heavy polished patina that covered all surfaces. This patina has been badly abraded in many areas and there are several large pock marks on both the blade and the socket. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail and has resulted in the loss of part of the base and the tip of the object. 

Similar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (c. 1500 - 1150BC). Others have been recorded on the database, including HESH-218915.

This fits into metalworking stage V-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3-4. The axe is decorated with rain pattern and bands of incised herringbone pattern.



The axe has a rounded butt which is about 30mm wide. The sides are straight for most of their length, then flare outwards to form a crescentic cutting edge with concave shoulders. The axe is thickest at the proto stop ridge (12.9mm thick) where the face of the butt and the face of the blade change in angle. This thickened area is decorated with a band of herringbone pattern incised across the axe. The band of decoration is 5.1mm wide and is divided into two rows of oblique lines, each row sloping in a different direction.



The cuttin edge is damaged, chipped and corroded with pitting and concretion adhering. It is 99mm wide but the tips are missing. The breaks are patinated. The first visible decoation is 16mm from the cutting edge. It is a group of at least three lines which follow the line of the cutting edge. Inside them is a band 7mm wide which is decorated with widely spaced lines forming triangles. Only one and a half are visible. Behind this band is a 9mm wide panel of herringbone pattern. The area is divided into three zones with incised lines following the line of the cuttin edge. The spaces are filled with punched oblique lines.



The sides of the face have a border of two engraved parallel lines, 2mm apart, following the line of the edge of the axe. This runs from the inside edge of the triple herringbone band, is unterrupted by the herringbone at the stop ridge, and contines to at least 50mm from the butt. Wherever the original surface survives on the butt and the blade, there is rain pattern; wide, shallow depressions, from 3 - 10mm long and about 0.5 - 0.7mm wide, orientated along the length of the axe.



The other face of the axe appears to be decorated in the same way, but has less detail surviving. It is uncertain whether some transverse lines across the middle of the butt are decoration or later damage. More rain pattern is visible.



The sides of the axe are thickened, but are not developed into flanges. They do not appear to be decorated, but little original surface survives and they are pitted.



The axe is similar to Willerby metalwork illustrated on page 125 of Rohn and Needham (1998), especially number 58. Compare also CORN-C53643 and SF-9072A6. The axe is 205mm long, 99mm wide and 12.9mm thick. 604g.

The object has been broken into two pieces on lifting due to an old break just below the blade.



The spearhead is broadly oval in plan and triangular in profile. It has a leaf or flame shaped blade. The tip of the spear is complete and the left side of the blade is complete with the cutting edge in tact, the right side of the blade is mostly complete aside from a irregular shaped piece missing from two thirds of the way down the blade. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) oval shaped midrib which expands into the socket of the spear. The socket is best described as being conical in shape. The spearhead is broken at a point above the socket, the break is jagged and the edges are abraded and patinated suggesting that the break is an old one, however the pieces detached on lifting when found. The socket is conical and tapers evenly inside the mid rib. At the base of the blade are two broadly rectangular shaped loops each with a rectangular perforation, when the two pieces of the object are together the loops are complete, they have been broken but no part is missing. The loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft, a part of which remains inside both pieces of the socket. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.



The object has a maximum length of 165 mm, a maximum width of 40.0 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 24.5 mm and a maximum weight of 97 g.



Piece 1 (Blade) - has a length of 97.2 mm and a maximum width of 40.0 mm at the base of the blade, the tip is 6.0 mm wide. It has a maximum thickness of 15.9 mm at the base and 4.2 mm at the tip. It weighs 43.7 g

The spear is a mid brown in colour with an uneven patina, there is evidence of areas of corrosion, as well as evidence, on the left side of the blade, of the original gold coloured patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



Similar basal-looped spearheads have been classified by Richard Davis (2006) and dated to the Middle Bronze Age. Davis has sub-classified these into classes / Types. This example corresponds best with his Type 6. Davis dates his Type 6 to the later Acton Park phase (1500-1300 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age the Taunton phase (1400 - 1200BC) and the early Penard phase (1250-1150BC) These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup.Other similar examples have also been recorded on the database, including HESH-BA2F61and HESH-821195.

734550,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"Middle Bronze Age copper-alloy Group III palstave (1500-1300 BC): A copper alloy palstave with very feint single mid rib and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On both faces of the blade there is a feint single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The surface of the blade has only small patches of a dark brown patina, mainly within the hollows, otherwise the surface is pitted. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion, but appears to be slightly asymmetrical. The blade facet is 11.62mm wide. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam. There is a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. Before the stop ridge, on both faces, there is a small shield-shaped/pattern decoration. The flange sides are a sub triangle in profile with casting seams, and are incomplete. One side, at the junction of the blade and stop there is an incomplete, integral loop which has a sub-lozenge section. The void is a sub semi-circle. In plan the septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, whose butt is rectangular with rounded corners. On one face of the butt terminal there are two large air holes visible. The palstave measures 159.16mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.90mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 29.16mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 398g.



The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group III type which has a mid rib decoration. Dot Broughton comments that 'shield-pattern below the stop ridge is small compared to others'. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC.



Peter Reavill comments that the palstave '...fits within Acton Park II or Taunton metalworking assemblage.' Therefore this can be classified further as fitting within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII. Similar axes are illustrated in Savoury (1980), Figure 22, Nos. 162 and 164.

735137,Pin,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"A Middle Bronze Age pin with a disc-shaped head, decorated shaft and perforated swelling on the shaft. The pin is a derivative of a Picardy-type pin and dates to c1400-1250BC. The pin is now bent but is complete and, if straight, measures 180mm. The surfaces are now mainly dark brown and there are iron-rich surface deposits, especially underneath the head of the pin. The disc-shaped head is 23.70mm in diameter and has a prominent rim on its upper face. The face of the disc is left rough and gives the impression there was an inlay made from a different material. Less than midway along the shaft is a prominent projection in the form of an elongated diamond which is pierced by a transverse hole now filled with corrosion products. Surface damage to the projection reveals a bright yellow metal.



Between this projection and the sloping base of the head the shaft is extensively decorated. The decoration comprises three, or more probably four, bands of (4 or 5) encircling grooves. Between each group of encircling grooves the shaft is covered with bands of alternating diagonal hatching.



Picardy type pins are dated from the early Taunton phase of the Bronze Age and according to the most recent interpretations probably go out of use by the Renard phase, giving a date range of between c.1400 and 1250 BC (Roberts, 2007: 141). These pins are still very rare along the Atlantic seabord although there are two others known from Suffolk and at least one from Norfolk, but in general they seem confined to southern and south-eastern Britain.",See SF-509598 for the head of a similar pin and further comment.,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-06-20T23:00:00Z,,,,32.7,,23.7,,180,1,David W Williams,David W Williams,South East,Oxfordshire,West Oxfordshire,Clanfield,SP2901,,51.70699339,-1.58171638,SUR-1EFCC6,,DSCF9553.JPG,Bronze Age: Picardy type pin,Berkshire Archaeology,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSCF9553.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/527492.jpg

Two joining fragments form a parallel sided strip, or ribbon. The whole is heavily disfigured by buckling and denting, including a sharp bend at the break Both ends are neatly squared suggesting that the complete object is present. One of the terminals is emphasised by a slight external beading. Prior to damage, the back would have been flat, while the front carries twenty-four very finely incised grooves aligned longitudinally.





Extant lengths 60.5 & 41.5 mm Length stretched out  c.117 mm width c. 17.5 mm thickness c. 0.5 mm weights  6.1 & 3.6 g","Identification



This object cannot be identified with total certainty, but similar multi-grooved ribbon ornaments of Bronze Age date and varied in size are known from north-west Europe; this provides the most likely cultural background. The length of the ribbon, if complete, is too short for other than a child’s bracelet. Another ornamental function is more likely.





Narrow-ribbon ornaments from the Saint-Marc-le-Blanc hoard, Brittany, have fewer and correspondingly broader ribs/grooves. They are finer on an earring from Saint-Père-en-Retz (Loire-Atlantique) and finer still on some Irish Bronze Age ornaments. Among the latter are examples in two important associations, from Saintjohns, Co Kildare, and Derrinboy, Co Offaly. The Derrinboy pieces have enhanced ribs along the long edges not present on the Flixton object, but they are of similar length. Good parallels are harder to find in Britain, but there is a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, excavated from a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age. Three gold grooved strips from Scottish grave finds which served as pommel mounts for Early Bronze Age daggers are crafted differently and may be less relevant.





Conclusion



This object is predominantly of precious metal, is almost certainly over 300 years old and potentially of archaeological interest both locally and for broader stylistic studies.

738013,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"A complete cast copper alloy late Early Bronze Age to early Middle Iron Age developed flanged axehead probably dating to between 1700-1500 BC. The axehead has a narrow round-ended butt, which widens slightly down the length of the axehead before widening into a thin crescentic blade with pointed ends. Along the length of the axehead are two raised flanges, which produce a roughly H-shaped cross section. In profile the axehead is a pointed oval shape.

738854,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"An incomplete copper alloy Late Bronze Age (c.1150-c.600 BC) pegged, socketed spearhead, missing the rim of its socket. Overall, the spearhead measures 50.7mm long, 24.5mm wide and 19.9mm thick. It weighs 24.20g.



The spearhead is small (stumpy). It has a short kite-shaped blade measuring 37.3mm long. The edges of the blade expand to a maximum of 5.1mm away from the midrib. The midrib extends to the tip of the blade. The midrib contains the socket for the spear's shaft, which is conical and expands rapidly towards the socket opening. The socket measures 35mm in depth and the opening has an external diameter of 22.9mm and an internal diameter 19.5mm. No organic material survives in the socket.



Below the blade there are four circular perforations through the rim of the socket, one on each side. Three of these are incomplete due to the broken rim of the socket. These perforations would have held pegs for holding the spearhead on the shaft. Normally pegged spearheads have only one or two holes which are aligned below the blade edges. The two holes aligned with the blade edges are both incomplete and have damaged edges coverd with pale corrosion product. The other two have much neater edges - the complete hole is a almost a perfect circle - with the same patination as the rest of the object. Drilled holes on similar spearheads tend to be quite rough so the neater holes may have been cast rather than drilled. 



An example of a similar pegged spearhead on the database is LVPL-D726F2.



Richard Davis says: These types of spearhead are normally found in hoards and are normally found in the Southeast. Besides the other example on the database, 58 spearheads of this type have been found in Britain. Five were found in hoard in Pembrokeshire, but most have been found in East Anglia around the edge of the Fenn or in the upper Thames Valley. Also 22 of them were found in the Blackmoor Hoard in Hampshire. This find suggests that there were links between the Trent Valley and the Southeast and that there was influence in Nottinghamshire area from the Southeast.

The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade.  A single incomplete rivet hole/notch to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, one of the notches still retains its rivet; the rivet is 15mm long with a 7mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The centre of the butt has a low central rib on both sides that extends up to the base of the blade. The blade is straight and only tapers to a point in the last 25mm of its length; the overall length of the blade alone is approximately 166mm long, 20mm wide and 3.8mm thick.  The end of the blade has been snapped off, the angle of the break shows that the final 65mm of the blade was bent back on itself to about a 140 degree angle before the metal gave way and snapped. This is not post-depositional damage but a premeditated act prior to loss/burial.

740817,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,42,"A cast copper-alloy unidentified object of a known type usually referred to as 'moustache-like' or 'moustache shaped'. These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material. The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper portion. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the base, which come to a halt about half way along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end, which is roughly sub-oval at its deepest point. At the point where the two symmetrical bars join, there is a plain band of roughly 4.1 mm in width. The distance between the two lower pointed terminal-ends is approximately 14.9 mm wide, indicating that the aperture ranges from 5.7 mm wide to 12.5 mm long. The entire object measures 20.59 mm long, 18.06 mm wide, 9.56 mm thick and weighs 9.48 grams.



Other hollow examples include: SUSS-3AEC48, WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. Unlike PAS recorded objects WILT-0C9A63 and NMS-0F4645 this example does not have two rivet holes, one each side of the opening. These holes are not seen on complete examples, such as this one, and may suggest repairs or a variation in design. The complete form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings. The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion.","
Although their function is uncertain, multiple hypotheses have been suggested, including decorative mount, dagger or scabbard chape. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example (Oxford Archaeology recovered a stratified example from Clay Farm, Trumpington; however it has yet to be published.

741085,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"
Cast late Bronze Age copper alloy miniature socketed axe. The object is covered in a pale yellowish green patina with patches of dark grey probably representing the dark silts in which it was found. There are very occasional small patches of bright copper metal showing. In profile, the sides of the axe are parallel flaring out abruptly to form a crescent shaped blade at one end and expanding slightly at the socketed end to produce a 'collar' around the mouth of the socket. Viewed on edge, the axe is a distinctly triangular shape with a prominent oval attachment loop projecting from one edge. Both edges show remnants of significant casting seams which are very rounded perhaps through wear or possibly through rough finishing during the manufacturing process. The blade is asymmetrical with one point of the blade noticeably longer than the other, possibly the result of sharpening over time.  The socket is a rounded rectangular shape narrowing to a lozenge shape towards the blade.  



Discussion:



The small size of the axe may indicate that it was intended for a more specialised activity such as carpentry rather than simply forest clearance. (Frances Lynch pers. comm.)

741155,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Late Bronze Age cast copper-alloy socketed hammer, (1000-800BC). The hammer is almost complete with some wear on the mouth and base. The hammer body face is almost rectangular, tapering slightly towards the mouth end. There is a lower moulding line and flared collar to the mouth. From a side view the tapering cannot be seen, and the base is rounded. The vertical corners on the hammer body are chamfered, resulting in an octagonal cross-section. The mouth is ovate in shape 27.75mm by 23.51mm. Casting seams can be seen on both sides, evidence of two piece moulding. The hammer surface is smooth with a dark brown patina, where this surface has been lost the metal is rough and a light green.



The earliest bronze hammers were created in the Middle Bronze Age Taunton metalwork phase, however hammer finds are more defined in Late Bronze Age hoard discoveries. Socketed hammers became more widespread in the Penard phase (c1200-950BC), and according to Burgess this tradition lasted longer in the North of Britain whereas the characteristics of the Wilburton Phase were prominent in southern Britain during the tenth century BC. Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart-Park Phase which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800BC. Burgess (1968) describes two socketed hammers from the Kilnhurst hoard in Yorkshire, one long and the other short which is similar to the example here. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding. The example described here is more likely a later example in the Penard Phase. Burgess also parallels Penard metalwork to continental examples and in particular western France.



In comparison to socketed axes, socketed hammers are a rare find, and to date only 35 recorded and publically accessible on the PAS database, 3 of which were found in North Yorkshire. Similar hammers to this example have been recorded as FAKL-9C9543, LVPL-5A7954 and SWYOR-D13642. The Kilnhurst hammers can be seen in Burgess (1938, Fig. 13, p.18).

Peter Reavill comments:



This is a Piggott (1946) Class I double-edged razor - some of these are decorated along the mid rib and many are pierced through the tang. The date is later EBA - early MBA and they are often associated with burials. This example is similar to Piggott's cat. no.34 which is from Winterslow, Wilts (and associated with cinerary urn and amber buttons / hair ornaments - now in Ashmoleon Museum). I would expect it to date in the region of c1800 BC - c1400 BC.","

The blade is narrow with straight sides with no suggestion of flanging and the cutting edge is rounded and blunt, though severely affected by corrosive pitting. The broken end of the blade still has the end of the socket which would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket is 21 mm long, 3 mm wide and 3 mm deep. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has partly corroded away and there are patches of light green bronze disease at the broken end. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, also refered to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but sparse. They date from the end of the Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase, and into Hallstatt C (c.800-700 BC).

Surviving length 41.0mm; surviving width 27.7mm; maximum thickness 9.5mm; surviving weight 35.2g.



Small blade fragment with a rounded midrib, approximately 11.8mm wide, with edge defined by single grooves to either side and on both faces. The outer sections of the blade are highly corroded, with no original blade edge surviving. The blade fragment is bent towards one end, as viewed side on, indicating it was forcibly broken in antiquity. The fragment has a green patination, with areas of ligher green corrosion along breaks. Cracking is visible on both sides, parallel with the midrib and near the corroded edges.



2. Carp's Tongue sword blade fragment



Surviving length 27.7mm; surviving width 28.6mm; maximum thickness 7.2mm; surviving weight 19.6g.



Small blade fragment with a rounded midrib, approximately 11.0mm wide, with edge defined by single grooves on either side of both faces. On one side of the blade, short sections of original blade edge are present, the outer blade section being slightly convex. On each outer blade section, a second, less pronounced groove also parallel with the blade edge is evident, approximately 4.2mm from the midrib edge grooves and 5.0mm from the blade edge (the total outer blade section being approximately 9.2mm wide). The surviving blade edge looks to have been deliberately damaged by a blade in antiquity, as evidenced by nicks and localised distortion of the blade edge. On one face, just below a break, there are impact dints on the midrib, causing localised flattening of the blade and an undulating surface. These are small and non-linear, suggesting the use of a pointed metal implement. This is further evidence of deliberate breakage of the blade in antiquity. The fragment has a green patination, with areas of lighter green corrosion along the least well preserved blade edge, in localised patches at blade breaks and in the blade edge nicks on the better preserved blade edge. Corrosion cracking is visible on the surface of the less well preserved outer blade side.



3. Purse- or bag-shaped chape fragment



Surviving width 47.1mm; surviving height 27.8mm; surviving weight 21.3g.



Base and body fragment of a chape with a curved convex base, defined by a convex ridge or bead on each face, and hollow interior. The walls of this chape thicken towards the base. On one side, a change in angle of the wall is visible, indicating a narrowing inwards towards the original mouth of the chape, now missing, thereby giving its characteristic 'purse' or 'bag' shape. At the break on the best preserved face, the partial circuit of a perforation, 2-2.5mm in diameter, is evident. This is offset from the centre line of the chape and was a point of attachment of the chape to the rest of the scabbard. No further perforations may be identified in the walls of this fragmentary chape. On one face, near the narrowing side wall, a surface dent can be seen. This was appears to have been made in antiquity and is possibly evidence of use wear or deliberate damage prior to burial. The artefact has a green patination with localised areas of light green corrosion on one face and along the line of breaks.



4. Multiple-edged perforated blade



Length 77.1mm; surviving width 42.7mm; maximum thickness at centre 8.0mm; surviving weight 88.0g.



A near complete, elongate hexagon shaped blade. The blade has a thickened elongate ridge along its longitudinal axis, tapering off on all sides, to form blade bevels and sharpened edges on all six sides. The blade has a rectangular shaped perforation at the centre and parallel with the long axis. The top of the aperture on each face is significantly larger than the actual perforation through the object. The apertures on each face, although overlapping, are also offset in relation to each other (on the long axis) and different in size. On each face, looking into the aperture, both an area of perforation and an area obscured by bronze from the centre to the lower face is evident. At one narrow end, a fragment of the blade bevel and edge has been broken off. The blade has a green patina. Original blade edges survive on one long side and one of the shorter end faces, the others being damaged and corroded with swelling light green corrosion product.



5. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 42.5mm; maximum surviving width 33.9mm; maximum thickness 20.8mm; surviving weight 122.1g.



Irregular upper surface and irregular convex shaped base. No edge sections apparent, although ingot fragment tapers on one side, where approaching an edge. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to blue-green patina.



6. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 73.5mm; maximum surviving width 57.1mm; maximum thickness 30.7mm; surviving weight 367.6g.



Irregular upper surface and irregular convex base. Breaks on two faces and tapering in two planes indicates this is a corner fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Large interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.



7. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 63.7mm; maximum surviving width 48.7mm; maximum thickness 34.6mm; surviving weight 462.4g.



Irregular upper surface and slightly convex shaped base. Breaks on all four sides indicate a middle fragment of an ingot although tapering in two planes indicate the fragment was approaching two sides of the ingot. Large interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.



8. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 56.0mm; maximum surviving width 49.8mm; maximum thickness 27.0mm; surviving weight 299.0g.



Irregular upper surface and slightly convex shaped base. Breaks on three sides and tapering in one plane indicate that this is a side fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.



9. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 75.0mm; maximum surviving width 63.8mm; maximum thickness 31.0mm; surviving weight 577.9g.



Irregular upper surface with vesicles and irregular convex shaped base. Three breaks and tapering in three planes suggest this is an incomplete end fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Interior vesicles are evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Light grey-green to grey-green patina.



10. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 87.0mm; maximum surviving width 60.3mm; maximum thickness 36.2mm; surviving weight 618.5g.



Irregular upper surface with vesicles and irregular convex shaped base with vesicles. Three major breaks and tapering in one plane indicate this is a side fragment of a plano-convex ingot. There is a small break along the edge, although short sections of original ingot edge are present. Breaks and vesicle edges have some angularity however lack of freshly exposed surfaces suggest breakage in antiquity. Light grey-green patina.","The classes and types of artefacts identified within this dispersed artefact scatter find close parallel within Late Bronze Age hoards elsewhere, with the combination of associated types indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating certainly to between 1000-800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997) and probably between 900-800 BC (Brandherm & Moskal-del Hoyo 2014, 33). This is consistent with their once having been buried at the same time and in direct association with each other in the ground, probably in a small purpose made shallow pit feature. It is probable that the original hoard burial place was disturbed though recent agricultural ploughing or boundary wall modification activity nearby. The scatter pattern, over a maximum distance of 22.5 metres, is entirely consistent with these likely scenarios, dispersal of objects being commonly observed during the recovery of hoards. It is possible that further artefacts from the hoard may be found in the immediate locality at future date and these would also be considered as potential treasure, in association with these earlier finds.



The two sword blade fragments in this hoard (nos. 1 & 2 above) may be identified as of Carp's Tongue form on the basis of their rounded midribs defined by single grooves following the outline of the blade (Colquhoun & Burgess 1988, 108; Needham 1990, 52). The chape fragment (no. 3 above), of diminutive size, with a convex base defined by a bead, sides narrowing towards the mouth and a perforation for attachment to the rest of the scabbard, may be identified as one of a class of bag-shaped or purse-shaped chapes, also termed Class 3 chapes (Eogan 1965, 169-74, Fig. 92 Nos. 11-14; Burgess 1968, 22-3, 38-39; Figs 13-14 & Appendix V; O'Connor 1980, 190-1). The multiple-edged and perforated blade (no. 4 above) can be identified as a knife, with variant forms termed racloirs and hog's-back knives (O'Connor 1980, 179). Racloirs are triangular in shape with three blade edges and a central perforation, while hog's back knives are sub-rectangular, have a single blade edge and a perforation set at the top margin opposing the blade edge. While preliminary research has not yielded close parallels for the Marloes & St Brides example, with its elongate hexagon shape, central perforation and four blade edges, nevertheless the combination of similar features and form permit confident identification as a knife allied with these known classes of knives.



Plano-convex ingot fragments (nos. 5-10 above) become common components of hoards towards the end of the Late Bronze Age. Over 40 Carp's Tongue hoards of Ewart Park date, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex copper alloy ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). Similarly, the St Ishmael, Carmarthenshire hoard contained a single plano-convex ingot fragment amongst a hoard of fifteen artefacts (Gwilt et al, unpublished treasure report).",3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-01-09T00:00:00Z,,2013T01,,,,,,,10,Adam Gwilt,Wenke Domscheit,,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Marloes and St. Brides,SM7709,From a paper map,51.73523117,-5.23102237,NMGW-1564D4,,DH007014_08.jpg,"Late Bronze Age Hoard from Marloes & St Brides, Pembrokeshire",National Museum Wales ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/DH007014_08.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/533697.jpg
742016,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"1, fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe that consists of the blade and the base of the socket. The break is ancient and irregular with bubbles form the casting visible in the cross-section. The blade has a very low curved forward edge which is heavily corroded. Behind the blade the surface of the axe is in excellent condition with a dark green patina that has a series of shallow striation that run up from the blade on the top and bottom edge that are probably formed from use or sharpening. The casting seam is visible but has been filed down. The body is decorated with three horizontal ribs on both sides. The socket at the rear is oval 37mm, long by 9mm wide and 4mm deep.



Length 40mm, width 49mm, thickness 18mm, weight 101g



2, fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe that consists of the blade and a small portion of the socket. The blades has a short curved working edge. The socket sits very close behind the blade and results in there only being 5mm of metal between the tip of the blade and the end of the socket. Although the remaining portion of the axe is heavily truncated the remaining section suggests it would have been a very narrow implement.



Length 27mm, width 32mm, thickness 13mm, weight 13.49g



3, fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axefrom the mid-section of the body. In cross-section that axe is rectangular with faceted sides of two faces. The body is decorated with three horizontal ribs on both sides.



Length 50mm, width 38mm, thickness 18mm, weight 67g



4, casting waste



Copper alloy teardrop shaped fragment of casting waste or a casting jet.



Length 20mm, width 17mm, thickness 15mm, weight 2.85g



5, Broken Late Bronze Age socketed axe that is 80% complete. This fragment is missing the lower half of the socket on one side. The blade has a low curved forward edge the tip of which is heavily corroded and suffering from bright green bronze disease. The sides of the blade curve inwards to the walls of the axe where a casting seam is visible, but which has been filed down. The body is decorated with three horizontal ribs on both sides which terminate just before the socket. The socket would originally have been rectangular, but approximately half of its length is now missing, the remaining portion has a semi-circular collar which is now heavily corroded. On one side of the axe is a projecting knop, this is the forward section of the truncated loop, the rear of the loop would have been on the missing element of the axe.



Length 57mm, width 33mm, thickness 26mm, weight 50.46mm,



Chronology: Socketed axes deposited in fragmentary, 'scrap' hoards are most common during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age c. 950-800 BC BC (Needham 1996).



Discussion: The axe fragments are too fragmentary to be assigned to a typological grouping. They are, however, of a comparable date and the addition of a fragment of casting waste is consistent with a so-called 'scrap' or 'founders' hoards of the Late Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2015-08-04T23:00:00Z,2015-08-04T23:00:00Z,2015T663,,,,,,,4,Kurt Adams,Kurt Adams,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Orcop,SO4525,Generated from computer mapping software,51.92079244,-2.80113846,GLO-2AFBCD,,GLO2AFBCDFragment4.JPG,GLO-2AFBCD Bronze Age casting waste fragmemnt,Bristol City Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO2AFBCDFragment4.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/533852.jpg

The break is worn but possibly not ancient. This is the widest part of the fragment and is a horizontally-elongated H in cross-section, measuring 28.0mm wide and 14.4mm thick. The sides of the axe are triangular in shape, narrowing to the butt end which is 2.4mm thick and 24.2mm wide, having a slightly curved end edge.

The patina is smooth and shiny and blue-green in colour. At the break bubbles (from the casting process) are visible and running longitudinally along the centre is a slight step, probably a join-mark. There are some signs of tooling to the outside edges of the flanges, which are 3.6-3.8mm thick at their widest.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-07-17T23:00:00Z,2015-07-17T23:00:00Z,,,21.47,,,14.4,25.7,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South East,Hampshire,Test Valley,Goodworth Clatford,SU3541,Generated from computer mapping software,51.16717945,-1.50080082,HAMP-56EF0C,,HAMP56EF0C.jpg,Middle Bronze Age palstave,Hampshire Cultural Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP56EF0C.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/534144.jpg
743164,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date ( about 1000 - 800 BC). The object can be classified as fitting into the Ewart Park phase of metalwork. The object has been broken and just the tip, including the deepest part of the socket survives.



The object is sub-rectangular in plan with the cutting edge flaring outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is almost complete but is very abraded. It measures 41mm in width, and is 1.4mm thick. At the incomplete socket end the object measures 34.8mm in width and is 12.1mm thick. The remaining socket is 2.5mm deep. The edges of the socket are broken irregularly.



Patches of a glossy dark brown patina remain on each face however the majority of the surface is pitted and abraded due to movement within the plough soil. Some small patches of light green corrosion are present.



Socketed axes are most common during the Ewart park phase of metal work which corresponds with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC. This would date the axe from about 1000 - 800 BC. However socketed axes were also known during the Wilburton phase of metalwork and due to the incompleteness of this example an earlier date cannot be ruled out.



The axe fragment is 25.7mm long and weighs 37.4g.

743264,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1100,"Possible Bronze Age (c.1600 to 1100 BC) chisel: This incomplete copper-alloy object may be a probable chisel or possibly a palstave. Only the blade end of the object survives, and the cutting edge is 32.17mm wide and the sides then taper to 29.27mm wide at the break, where it is 12.46mm thick and a rounded sub-lozenge in cross-section. No evidence of the side flanges or stop ridge survive making the object hard to classify and date confidently. The faces of the artefact has a trace of a swollen rib. The surface of the artefact has traces of a dark green patina and is otherwise abraded. The patina is not heavy and there is no pitting on the surface. The patina also covers the break. The tool is 33.86mm long, 32.08mm wide and 12.25mm thick. 47.86g.



The artefact is very similar to SWYOR-2DED2C on this database. The narrowness of the blade and thickness at the break are perhaps more similar to chisels such as NMS-894E92, SF2649 and SOMDOR-7B3C43 on this database, but it have the horizontal sides of the more common chisel form, as seen on SF-09D1D5 and SUSS-D93644 on this database. However, small, narrow-bladed palstaves belonging to the Taunton phase (1400-1300 BC) of metalworking or possibly to the slightly earlier Acton Park II period, (c.1500-1400 BC); (both corresponding with Needham's period 5, 1500 - 1150 CAL BC) are also similar, especially in the rapid thickening from blade to break. It was perhaps similar to SOM-1DE687, HAMP-996311. Further arguments on either side are given in SOM-2B70A5, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1600 - 1100 BC.



The patina is not typical of Bronze Age artefacts, and therefore there is a possibility that the item is of a later date. Another possible function is a vessel leg, but this is not a convincing identification based on the shape, surface condition and section.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2014-10-09T23:00:00Z,2015-04-12T23:00:00Z,,,47.86,,,12.25,33.86,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Malvern Hills,Alfrick,SO7452,From a paper map,52.16564945,-2.38154056,WAW-D02B82,,WAWD02B82.jpg,"Possible Bronze Age Chisel (plan, profile, reverse and two sections).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWD02B82.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/535618.jpg

744139,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Description: 



(I am grateful to John Llywelyn Williams for the following description & discussion)



The find comprises two fragments of a copper alloy flat axe.



The larger blade fragment was initially thought to be all that survived. This fragment represents the lower half of the axe which has been severed from the butt end at a slight angle. The surface is of a generally uniform mid-brown colour with significant patches of green mottling signifying active corrosion. The fragment is slightly asymmetric in plan with one side gently concave and the other side continuing in a straighter line to the blade termination. The blade forms a shallow crescent with an abraded, irregular cutting edge, possibly from use in antiquity but accentuated by decay. Both points of the blade are missing and may have suffered from more recent damage. The surviving width of the blade is 85.4mm. The axe faces are both flat, producing a rounded rectangular body in section with a width at the break of 38.9mm and a maximum thickness of 16.3mm. One face of the axe fragment is pitted whilst the reverse face is smooth and exceptionally well preserved and may show evidence of the grinding and polishing undertaken to produce the completed object.



The second fragment was found several days after the discovery of the main blade fragment and was found some 4m away. It is a mid-green colour with dark grey surface mottling possibly representing soil staining. The two faces are fairly smooth but with noticeable scattered pitting. It is nearly rectangular in plan though the edges do converge slightly towards one end. The wide end is 38.91mm wide and the narrow is 29.62mm wide. The edges are rounded and again quite pitted, and they thin rapidly towards the narrower end of the fragment. The narrow end is quite thin (3.76mm) and is curled over at its extreme tip probably due to damage. The wide end is a broken edge and is very irregular. On one face the edge is fairly straight but on the other face it intrudes into the fragment body suggesting a significant wedge of metal is now missing. The corrosion on the break surface is quite powdery suggesting recent active decay.



Discussion:



The axe fragments probably belong to a single 'Migdale' type axe. The close correspondence of the measurements of width and thickness at the break, and the fairly regular, contiguous shape in plan formed by the two fragments would seem to support this.



Early Bronze Age flat axes of type 'Migdale' (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44)1 belong to 'Metalworking Assemblage III', corresponding to Needham's (1996)2 Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC (though the typology of axes is currently under review). The Coed Bolyn axe is the first Migdale example from Gwynedd, if not from the whole of the area north of the Dee - Wynion river divide with the exception of the two Anglesey axes from Talwrn and the unprovenanced example possibly from  Llangaffo.



The most significant feature of the axe is its large size. The average length of the 24 complete Migdale type axes from Wales is 14.2cm with a blade width of 8.1cm (21 axes). In the Welsh corpus the only axe of comparable size is the complete example in the Oxwich hoard from the Gower peninsula (Swansea) with a length of 18cm, and a blade width of 13.3cm.



A second significant feature is the break that has divided the axe approximately in half. On the blade fragment, the break is clean and straight although it has produced a weak discontinuous peripheral lip on one side with a small projecting tail at the terminal end. This would suggest that the object has been bent, and snapped under pressure to leave the slight accretion on the lower side.



This 'clean' sharp break may also indicate deliberate breakage. Clean breaks of this type have been reproduced under experimental conditions. A bronze axe placed in a bonfire and heated to approximately 900ºC may be snapped if beaten while red hot over a projecting ledge to produce the slight underside lipping described above (David Chapman, Ancient Arts Ltd. pers. comm.).



Axes may be broken up in antiquity as part of a recycling programme. However this axe does not appear to have been crudely smashed.There is growing evidence that axes and axe fragments were buried in significant and deliberately chosen locations near to water courses, springs, bogs or in areas associated with other prehistoric activity.



However the break on the butt fragment of this axe is of a completely different character. The edge on one face is fairly straight and regular but the edge on the other face has a large wedge of material missing; torn or broken away. The regular edge is a fair match for the break on the main blade fragment, but the other edge does not match at all and there is no matching lip. This suggests that either the original breakage was not as clean and precise as at first thought, or that the butt fragment has been subjected to later secondary damage. As the two fragments were found approximately 4m apart, it is likely that they have been disturbed at some time, possibly by ploughing, and it may be that the butt break was further modified at this point.

The chisel is roughly wedge shaped, tapering to a hammered point from a wide circular rim at the socket end. The socket itself is roughly square shapedand appears to have iron oxide within in the socket. The entirety of the object is a rough dark brown with patches of light brown corrosion and the occasional hint of light coppery metal.

744857,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A cast copper alloy socketed side-looped spearhead found in two pieces, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1550 BC - 1250 BC. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade, hollow socket and cast side loops; Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'.The spear head has broken, fairy recently, across the lower part of the blade. The two pieces were found about 6 metres apart. The tip piece is 57.2mm long, 19.9mm wide and 9.6mm thick. The socket piece is 74.2mm long, 23.1mm wide and 17.7mm thick.



The blade measures about 75mm in length, 23.1mm in width and the tip of the blade is 2.6mm thick. The overall shape of the blade can be described as being leaf-shaped. It has straight sides at the point end, with a rounded base near the socket. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear.



The base of the socket is 17.7mm in diameter. The internal socked measures 63.9mm deep. The two loops are positioned 14.5mm below the base of the blade. The loops measure 14mm in length and are 4.1mm wide. The loops are fairly flat in cross-section.



The object has a smooth dark brown to olive green patina which is pitted in places. Some of the blade edge is damaged. The break between the two pieces is less patinated than the rest of the object, but it is not an immediately recent break.



LVPL-893C73 is a similar example (among others on the PAS database) and the record notes that ""Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age.

Davis (2017), however, suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly.

The flat-sectioned butt is sub-trapezoidal in plan, the thickness gradually declining towards a scallop-shaped upper end. Two C-shaped notches, located below this upper portion, mark the points at which the now-missing handle plates would have been attached. The widest point is at the shoulders, beneath which the concave sides angle inwards, smoothly extending into the parallel-sided blade. This blade is of lozenge-shaped cross section and has been broken in antiquity. The piece has a mid to dark brown surface patina (slightly pitted in places) which suggests deposition within a damp environment.



Length: 81.8mm; width: 31.7mm; thickness: 4.4mm. Weight: 34.01g.



This rapier forms part of a dispersed group of Middle to Late Bronze Age metalwork found to the north of Faringdon and concentrated on the northern side of the River Thames. Close parallels include a complete (albeit broken) rapier (GLO-036A39) and pieces of two further such implements (SUR-A18104/Treasure case 2015 T331).

The socket is circular with an exterior diameter of 15.6mm, interior diameter of 12.1mm and is 20.7mm deep. From the socket the blade tapers to a rounded cutting/gouging edge which is concave to one side of the body. The gouging edge is extremely worn.



Peter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer for Herefordshire & Shropshire, states that this gouge is of Wilberton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking, phases which correspond to Needham's (1996) Period's 6 - 8.



The metal has a dark greenish-brown patina and is worn. The gouge is 49.6mm long, 15.6mm in diameter at the socket, 13.4mm x 7.1mm at the cutting edge and the walls are 1.9mm thick. The object weighs 23.5g.



Comparable socketed gouges have been recorded on the PAS database. For examples see: SWYOR-FCB525, NMGW-62C84F, DUR-06F0E8, IOW-EC25A7 and SUR-7898C5. The latter record notes that: ""Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).""",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,23.5,,15.5,1.9,49.6,1,Rebecca Griffiths,Rebecca Griffiths,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Ryedale,Cawton,SE6476,GPS (from the finder),54.17580544,-1.02101455,YORYM-CD7FFB,,BL1294.jpg,Bronze Age : Gouge,York Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/BL1294.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/537257.jpg
745700,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Cast copper alloy MIddle Bronze Age early short-flanged axehead, developing from a flat axe to a palstave with low side flanges and only a slight stop ridge. The side flanges are leaf-shaped in profile and damaged but their highest point is in line with the slight stop ridge which runs across the width of the axehead above the 'septum' or recessed area between the flanges. This ridge would have stopped the wooden haft from shifting on to the septum and the side flanges would have stopped any sideways movement and would help to bind the haft to the axehead. The undecorated septum is slightly lower than the blade. The blade is short, only 35 mm long from the faint stop, but would have originally been more crescentic and has since worn away during use and is now only slightly flanged. The surface of the axehead is quite worn and pitted but there is no active bronze disease.



Needham (1979) illustrates similar small axes from Teignmouth in Devon and Gerrans in Cornwall on pages 273-4,  figs.6-7, no.4 which are part of the Arreton repertoire from the early Middle Bronze Age, c.1700-1500 BC.

746068,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"A fragment of a cast copper-alloy 'Sussex Loop' bracelet of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1400-1250 BC. The fragment consists of one-half of one of the double loop strands, which is lozenge-shaped in cross-section and terminates in the flattened sub-oval terminal hook, which would have fitted the arm band to the other looped element of the bracelet. The apex of the lozenge cross-section has been decorated with small incised lines, positioned slightly obliquely across the apex. The terminal end has been further decorated with two other raised ridges flanking the central apex mentioned above and one of these also bears the traces of small incised oblique lines, whereas the other ridge is too worn to discern this decoration. The entire fragment has an overall dark green patina and colour and the break across the centre of the arm band is flat and distinct, similar to the cuts in 'Sussex Loop' bracelets found in Middle Bronze Age hoards from Sussex (cf. Treasure case 2011 T192, the 'Near Lewes' Middle Bronze Age hoard). The fragment measures 86.47 mm long, 45.1 mm wide, 10.16 mm thick and weighs 69.28 grams.



Discussion: 'Sussex Loop' bracelets have been attributed this title because nearly all known examples originate from the Brighton-Lewes East Sussex area. Recently, a further two Sussex Loop bracelets were discovered in Surrey and given the Treasure number: 2013T316. These examples were the furthest discovery point away from the original examples and potentially the only non-Sussex examples known and were designated finds of significance for this reason. This example, having been discovered in West Sussex is another example of a non-Brighton-Lewes area bracelet and as such, begins to raise issues with this type of bracelet being designated as only coming from this locality. However, because of the reasonable radius of the new discoveries from the original ones, it is still possible that these could be items of local manufacture and circulation.","
This fragment was subjected to XRF metallurgical analysis by Dr. Jaime Kaminski at the University of Brighton. Dr. Kaminski confirms that the alloy used here is similar in composition to others of this type and as such, should be stylistically and compositionally acceptable for identification as a 'Sussex Loop' fragment in spite of missing other diagnostic elements to old damage.

The lower part of the object consists of an inverted-sub-conical plug. The upper end of this plug bifurcates into 3 circular-sectioned arms, each with a vertical, flat outer face.



Casting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below. As they represent re-usable metal, they were often retained and regularly turn up in founder's hoards of the period. Given the jets size it is unlikely to be from brooch production and is more likely to relate to a large object such as an axe, dagger or sword. Similar to BH-8BDE6E, BH-4D6780 and ESS-39BA43

746362,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete decorated flat axe of the Early Bronze Age, dating from c. 2000 BC - 1700 BC. This fits with Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.



The flat axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid(pointed oval), with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid. The axe is broken toward the butt of the axe, but more than three-quarters of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; however a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This has been formed from hammering and small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces where the metal has been worked to form them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, just forming a change of angle between the face of the butt and the face of the blade. Below the bevel (change of angle) the sides continue to expand. The area from the edge of the butt to the junction with the blade facet is decorated on both faces of the axe. The decoration is formed from a series of parallel linear lentoid lozenges. This form of decoration is known as rain-pattern and is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. It stops at the blade facet. The side edge of the axe have been abraded heavily and it is difficult to tell whether there is any further decoration. Beneath the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is present. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge.



The axe measures 98.1 mm in length, it is 30.4 mm wide at the butt and the blade is 78.6 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 9.2 mm, the blade is 5.7 mm thick, and at the median ridge the axe is 11.3 mm thick. It weighs 210.8 g.



The axe is a mid green in colour with a highly polished patina, which has been damaged in areas. Where this had occurred it is probably as a direct result of movement in the plough soil. This abrasion is most evident on the reverse of the axe. There are, however, a series of large scars which have removed areas of decoration. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. On the front surface of the axe to the right and towards the blade is an area of unusual blue/green corrosion. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Some of this abrasion is modern and has cut through the patina and corrosion revealing the dull gold colour of the meatl beneath. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the decorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. This axehead forms part of the corpus of earliest bronze axes of Britain. They are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

748515,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Primary / Early Bronze Age copper-alloy Group II palstave (1500-1300 BC): The blade of the palstave is sub-trapezoidal in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On one face of the blade there is a feint single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The other face, where they may have been a mid rib, there is an off-centre low-relief score mark or damage, but this is not recent. The edge bevel to the blade is 16.58mm deep. The cutting edge appears to be symmetrical. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. The edges of the blade, on both faces, are slightly raised with flanges running down the flaring blade. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam.



The palstave, on both faces, has a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. Before the stop ridge, on one face, there is a small, shallow depression which is probably not a shield-shaped/pattern decoration. The flange sides are a sub oval in profile with casting seams.



In plan the septrum is rectangular and the butt has a broken corner, and this is not a recent break. The patina of the break appears to match the surface of the palstave. On one face of the septrum there is a small patch of active corrosion which is in a slight depression, and appears to reveal a void beneath this patch of corrosion.



The two faces of the palstave have differing corrosion products occurring, one side has a dark brown patina with some encrustation. The other face has a mottled grey and green matte surface. On one side face there is fresh metal visible due to recent damage.



The palstave measures 153mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 70.36mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 28.48mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 402g.



The palstave is an early/primary example and is classified as a Group II type, probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages. Needham Period 5, Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC



Peter Reavill comments '... Looking at Burgess and Schmidt - we could probably suggest, using their typology, that this is a Early Palstave Group II - Early Mid-ribbed Type Liswerry. Being similar to an example from Whinfell, Cumbria (p127 cat no 794 plate 58) and Roundhay, West Riding, Yorkshire (ibid: 794a) In the discussion they say that Liswerry implements have elegant narrow form similar to the earlier flanged axes - they tend to have narrow bodies blade sides that diverge little from the butt and then flare to form widely expanded blade with deeply curved cutting edge and defined blade tips. Further they have flange extensions that descend well down the blade conjoining with a well-defined chamfered cutting edge - and the mid-rib is also long. (ibid 126)'.



Regarding the nature of the surface condition of the palstave, this may be reflecting deposition conditions. Peter Reavill suggests that the iron stained patina may have occurred if deposited in a waterlogged area, or at least had been recovered from an archaeological strata at the junction between the plough and undisturbed sub-soil where an iron pan was formed.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-07-15T23:00:00Z,2015-09-29T23:00:00Z,,,,,,,,1,Peter Reavill,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Rugby,Clifton upon Dunsmore,SP5276,From finder,52.37957621,-1.23750407,WAW-245FB6,,WAW245FB6.jpg,"Bronze Age Palstave (profile, plan, profile, blade terminal, plan, butt terminal).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW245FB6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/538607.jpg

749072,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy flat axehead, sub-rectangular in plan and section and triangular in profile, with a rounded end and broken edge where it is missing its blade and more than half of the axe so that just the butt end remains. This end, opposite the blade end, would have been hafted to a wooden handle. The fragment tapers slightly towards the butt end which is rounded off and widens towards the broken edge which has been partly chiselled off, but has since softened through corrosion and wear. The axehead would have continued to expand into a triangular flat blade which is now missing. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now very pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away.





The length is 50 mm, the width of broken edge is 32 mm and the width of the butt end is 26.5 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 8 mm and the thickness of the butt end is 5 mm.



Similar slender flat axes with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.



Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of slender Migdale type flat axes from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall and Salcombe in Devon, on pages 400 & 453, plates 1 & 38, nos.6 & 289, and a similar fragment of a flat axe that has been chiselled at one end from Penzance, Cornwall on page 423, pl. 15, no.123, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Braddock Downs in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.36, 111 & 213.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

751390,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy blade from a socketed axehead that is sub-square in plan, triangular in profile and rectangular in section. The blade is narrow with straight sides with no suggestion of flanging and the cutting edge is rounded and blunt, though severely affected by corrosive pitting. The broken end of the blade still has the end of the socket which would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket is 20 mm long, 5 mm wide and 13 mm deep on the side that is intact. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has partly corroded away and there are patches of light green bronze disease at the broken edges. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, also refered to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but sparse. They date from the end of the Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase, and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-700 BC).

The spearhead was found in two parts, and subsequently pinned and the join obscured by green, probably acrylic-based paint. That the break fits would suggest that it was fairly recent damage, rather than an intentional feature of the object's deposition.



The spearhead has an abraded piriform blade, surviving to 19.6mm wide at its shoulders and tapering into a worn break below the point, 10.8mm wide. The blade has a central rib, sub-lozengiform in cross section, flanked by the largely flat wings of the blade, in thickness this mid-rib is 6.8mm at the break, and 12.6mm at the juncture between the blade and socket. This is is sub-circular in cross section and sub-connical in form, tapering from 16.8mm in width at the mouth to 9.6mm at the juncture between the socket and blade. In profile the spearhead tapers continuously from the mouth of the socket, 18.0mm thick, to the break at its point. Two integral, incomplete side loops expand from opposing sides of the socket, on the same plane as the wings of the blade. The depth of the socket could not be measured, with it being blocked by the abovementioned repairs.

755698,Mount,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-800,"Description: A Bronze Age gold decorative band dating 2200-800BC. This is a circular band of gold with parallel sides and stamped and incised decoration. There is no visible seam. The decoration comprises an irregular line of dots running along the midline of this band; the dots have been stamped through from the reverse. There is an incised line running both above and below the line of dots forming borders. The shape of the band is distorted and irregular.



Dimensions: height: 4.4mm; thickness: 0.3mm; diameter: 25mm; weight: 1.41g.



Metal composition: Analysis by Dr Harriet White (British Museum) established that the precious metal content is more than 10% and the composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date: ""Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the decorated band from London, indicated a surface composition of approximately 85-86% gold, 13-14% silver, and less than 1% copper. The decorated band weighs 1.42 g."" (Department of Scientific Research, British Museum, File No. 7643-2 2015 T941, 20th January 2017)



Discussion: No exact parallel is known for this object but the decoration of goldwork with dot and incised line decoration is a known feature of (Early) Bronze Age goldwork (e.g. Taylor 1970) and the metal composition does not disagree with a Bronze Age date. The function of the object is unclear but it is unlikely to have been a finger ring and is more likely to have been a fitting, perhaps comparable to dagger hilt bands of this period, although these differ in form and decoration from this find.

756860,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy sword blade, sub rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in profile and section. Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is at the end that tapers towards the tip or point, as any raised area has flattened out in section. The surface of the blade has more corrosion product and is more pitted on one face than the other, probably due to exposure. There are also gashes and later damage on both faces, which has happened since deposition. The fragment may be a result of deliberate decomissioning of a sword into separate pieces before it was ritually destroyed, or it may have been broken up in order to melt it down and re-use the metal. The two broken edges may also have been subsequently trimmed in order to re-use the weapon as a tool such as a razor or scraper.



The lozenge-shaped section of the blade without a defined central mid-rib suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.



Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate two similar lozenge-shaped sections of Ewart Park swords on page 135, fig.37, nos.386-7.

756915,Vessel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1200,-700,"A fragment of a copper-alloy cauldron lug of possible Bronze Age date, possibly c. 1200-700 BC in date as suggested by the below arguments. It is also possible that this item dates to the Iron Age or later and this is also discussed below. The remaining fragment is a portion of one of the cauldron's handle loops, but this fragment has broken off from the larger vessel, now missing. The fragment is curved in profile, with three deeply grooved ridges on the outer surface, which have been indented along the centre, suggesting that another element abutted this area. The interior edge of the loop is smooth and undecorated. Both surfaces have a dark green patina and colour. This fragment measures 19.2mm long, 13.1mm wide, 3.4mm thick and weighs 3.78 grams.



A parallel with additional portions of the vessel attachment has been recorded onto the PAS database as: SF-832744 . That example was extensively discussed by specialists and a portion of that discussion is included here:



'This is a handle from a large sheet copper-alloy cauldron. Parallels in the Late Bronze Age are noted with Gerloff's (1986) Class A cauldrons, notably the Shipton Type and Tulnacross Type caulrons (Gerloff, 1986: pp. 93-97, cf. fig. 10 for examples from the Isleham Hoard; see Ashmolean Museum AN 1928.324 for the Shipton-on-Cherwell cauldron). See also examples of buckets with similar handles in Gerloff (2004), notably from Hatfield (Gerloff, 2004: fig. 17.4). These would indicate a date range in the Late Bronze Age Penard to Ewart Park phases, perhaps c.1200-700 BC. However, similarities with later, Iron Age, examples are also evident, such as in parallels from Sheepen in Essex (Colchester Caslte Museum) and the Battersea Cauldron (BM 1861, 0309.1), which have similar sheet construction and cast copper-alloy handles. The current example is quite possibly Late Bronze Age in date, perhaps as early as the last quarter of the 2nd millennium BC, however a later (Iron Age or later) date range cannot be ruled out entirely.'",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-10-27T00:00:00Z,2015-10-27T00:00:00Z,,,3.78,,,3.4,19.2,1,Stephanie Smith,Liz Walker,Eastern,Norfolk,Breckland,East Tuddenham,TG0812,Generated from computer mapping software,52.66578814,1.07453739,SUSS-8438EC,,SUSS8438ECFragmentofUncertainObject.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS8438ECFragmentofUncertainObject.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/544473.jpg

758435,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The profile of the axe is an irregular pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In cross section the body of the axe has a slight H-shape as the side edges of the axe have been raised by hand hammering to form slight flanges, and therefore forming a curved sloped to the base of the spetum. The depth between the height of the flanges and base of the centre of the spetum is 1.23mm. The flanges appear to have been cast an probably augmented by hammering. The sides of the axe are slightly convex bulging outwards slightly from the upper edge of the 'H' section; there is no decoration present and the casting flanges have been trimmed filled and hammered flat. The centre of the sides, running from the butt to the start of the blade, has a flattened band at the apex of the convex face. On both faces of the axe there is a slight bump / rib / proto-stop ridge, measuring 44.90mm from the apex of the butt. 80.82mm from the apex of the butt, on each face there is a very slight ridge when the blade then tapers which is the median bevel. On one face the space between the bump/rib-stop and the median bevel is very slightly undulating, on the other face the space is slightly concave. In plan the sides of the blade flare outwards towards the blade tips. One blade tip is complete and is a blunt point, the other is slightly rounded. Both the tips have lost their patina, but the shaping is perhaps due to use rather than recent damage. In plan the cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical. There is no obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge, only the slight ridge which is 24.17mm from the apex of the cutting edge. The surface of the axe has a well developed, mottled dark green to brown patina, which is slightly pitted on the blade. When the surface is reflected in a good light there is a hint of a shiny fine grey glittery surface which is likely to be due to leaching of the alloys in the burial environment where the tin element is better preserved.



The axe measures 103.92mm long, 62.85mm across from blade tip to blade tip, 12.18mm thick at the bump/rib-stop, and weighs 180.31g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.

759038,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-1000,"Circumstances of discovery



Three objects found together on 29 November 2003 using a metal-detector. Subsequent excavation on the find-spot, conducted by David Williams, Finds Liaison Officer for Surrey, has shown an important relationship to ancient, probably Bronze Age, landscape features. Furthermore, the hoard appears to have lain beneath a small cairn of tightly packed flint nodules.





Description



Palstave 1 (axehead)



A palstave with a gently flared and heavy blade ornamented with a stout trident rib design. The stop, at the blade/haft end junction is massive and protrudes well beyond the linking flanges in profile. The side loop is unusually thick and has an octagonal cross-section. The septum floor is effectively flat with a sharp angle where it meets the inner flange faces.





Length 184 mm;  width blade 49 mm; weight 623.5 g





Palstave 2



The second palstave is rather different in style. The blade starts parallel at the top, then expands progressively towards the convex cutting edge. It too carries stout ‘decoration’, this time just a single medial rib on either face, giving the upper blade a hexagonal section. The stop shows similar protuberance relative to the flanges as seen on palstave 1, while the septum floor is again flat with strong angles along the flanges. The loop is slighter with a sub-oval cross-section.





Length 168 mm;  width blade 52 mm; weight 492.1 g





Chape (sword-scabbard terminal)



A thin-walled socketed fitting, the socket of which continues to within 6 mm of the terminal. The body of chape is rhombic-sectioned with the addition of narrow flattened sides throughout its length. At the end it expands slightly into a sub-lozenge ‘button’ terminal. The mouth is very gently V-shaped in plan view. Two neat perforations on opposing faces provide for rivet fixings to the wood or leather lining of the scabbard.





Length 157.5 mm; width mouth 40 mm; weight 72.5 g





Metal composition



No analysis has been conducted, but there is no doubt that these are copper-alloy objects, of either bronze or leaded bronze.","Identification



The two palstaves, although different in detail, are united by features characteristic of the Late type. These include relatively narrow blades and the specific stop/flange/septum form. Late palstaves belong to the Late Bronze Age between circa 1150 and 800 BC. Associated finds suggests that there are some significant shifts in style between the earlier and later half of this period, but the full range of variation as seen in extant axes is not yet represented in hoards. This gives considerable importance to the association in the Mickleham hoard of two style variants with a more closely dated bronze type.





The chape belongs to the ‘tongue-shaped’ family. Long tongue chapes occur in both the Wilburton metalwork assemblage and in some early Ewart hoards (Blackmoor stage), the full potential span being circa 1150-900 BC. However, the near straight mouth of the Mickleham example is not found in the later group and so it can almost certainly be attributed to the Wilburton stage, circa 1150-1000 BC.





Conclusion



The Mickleham bronzes were clearly found together as a closed group and had probably been sealed under a small flint cairn at about the same time. They date to the Wilburton stage of the Late Bronze Age and are eligible as Treasure under the new Treasure Order (2002) being a base-metal prehistoric associated find containing two or more metal objects.

762924,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1350,"A near complete copper alloy Middle Bronze Age dirk, dating to the period c. 1550-1350 BC. The trapezoidal hilt plate / butt end is damaged by movement in the plough zone; however, the remains of two rivet holes are discernible on the feathered external edge. A further slight notch is present on the exterior edge which may possibly suggest the handle was originally fixed with four rivets. The original mushroom rivets are all lost. The dirk is widest across the trapezoidal plate - below this the shoulders narrow to form the blade which is a flattened lozenge (lentoid) shape in cross section. The blade has a distinctive central rib which extends to the tip / point of the blade. This thickened rib adds strength to the blade and is a diagnostic feature of this type of short sword or dirk which is thought to be used for thrusting and piercing rather than cutting and slashing. The cutting edges of the blade are complete but have been damaged in places by movement in the soil. There seem to be no direct notches in the cutting edge (caused through use / parrying blows). The dirk is a mid green colour with a well preserved surface patina which is pitted, particularly on one side, by surface corrosion. Area of distinct patinated longitudinal scratches are present on both sides of the blade and lower part of the hilt plate - these marks are most likely caused through use / sharpening rather than as a result of the burial environment. The dirk has been bent at c. 45 degrees. The centre of the bend is on the upper part of the blade / soon after the butt end narrows into the blade. This bending has resulted in patinated transverse stress fractures / striations on the outer face of the bend, and a large area missing the surface on the inner face. The position of the bend suggests that the hilt was present when the blade was deliberately damaged; hilts in this period were organic being made of bone, horn, or wood. Such bending is common on metal deliberately deposited within ritual environments - specifically areas on the edge of wetlands. The findspot lies in an area rich in paleo-channels suggesting that it would have been placed in a marginal area prior to modern drainage. The dirk is best attributed to Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group II as it has an undecorated form with central rib, flattened lozenge cross section and a trapezoidal butt end / hilt plate. The dating of this type fits with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking stages of the Middle Bronze Age - which corresponds with Needham (1996) Period 5 and Burgess's Metalworking stage IX.



A similar dirk has been recorded on the PAS database from Whittlebury, Northamptonshire (NARC-CC1CF4).



The dirk measures 158mm in length, 44mm in width at its widest point at the butt end, 24mm in width midway along the blade, 3.49mm in thickness at the butt end and 4.68mm at its thickest towards the point.

762987,Ear Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"A gold loop of uncertain function made of square cross-sectioned rod that has been bent into a sub-circle shape, one side is slightly distorted and straight and the terminals are over-lapping. The rod is thickest at its centre and thinnest at the terminals.



Dimensions: Weight: 8.44g; Diameter: 22mm by 22mm; Thickness: 5mm (max.) - 1mm (min.)



Metal composition:

Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the ear-ring carried out by the British Museum's Department of Scientific Research indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-87 % gold, 11-12 % silver and at least 1% copper. The ear-ring weighs 8.44 grams.



Discussion:

Gold rod with square cross-section is a typical feature of both Middle and Late Bronze Age British ornaments (cf. Eogan 1994), but is rarely found in other periods. The precise form of the gold loop is not closely paralleled by other known examples bar and usual copper alloy penannular ring found in Hampshire (PAS-HAMP114), also of uncertain but probably later Bronze Age in date. The metal composition does not disagree with this statement.

763690,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"An incomplete cast copper alloy tanged spear / spearhead of Early Bronze Age (Arreton industry) date (1700-1500 BC). The object is broken across the lower blade and the tang and butt of the blade are preserved. The blade would have been lanceolate in shape (being broadly triangular in plan) and has a pronounced, raised central rib terminating at the junction with the tang. This rib is present on both faces of the blade. The cross section of the blade is lentoid (lanceolate). The tang is integrally cast and rectangular in shape; it tapers toward the butt end where the lower edge is broken across a oval shaped rivet hole. Sub rectangular depressions are present on both faces on the upper part of the tang. The outer edges of the blade are heavily abraded and both the ends of the object terminate in old patinated but abraded breaks. The metal is a mid-brown in colour with a thick well preserved surface patina on most faces; where abrasion has removed this patina patches of light green, pitted corrosion are present. This form of spearhead is relatively rare with only 47 examples recorded in the recent volume British Bronze Age Spearheads (Davis 2012). This form of spearhead corresponds with  Davis's (2012) Group I form and of Arreton Down metalworking dating to the latest part of the Early Bronze Age, (Early Bronze Age III) which correspondes to Needham's (1996) Period 4 dated c. 1700 - 1500BC and Burgess's Metalworking stage VII.  Two similar examples of Arreton metalworking tradition spearheads are recorded on the PAS database from Penllyn, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0BF252) and Shalfleet, Isle of Wight (IOW-221956) . 



An image of this was sent to Richard Davis (University of Nottingham) who comments:



[This is an] Arreton tanged spearhead. However some of its attributes do not match any of the 47 that I have recorded in the PBF book. The blade base has a protruding ridge or rib which is not present on other tanged spearheads. This, however, is found on some of the early socketed spearheads (Arreton phase). The narrow vertical, central rib on the blade is not present on other tanged spearheads, but again this attribute is similar to some on the early socketed spearheads. The indentation on the upper face of the tang is unique. It may have been designed as a seating for some form of bronze collar which also abutted the ridged blade base (see the well known Snowshill spearhead). The length of the tang and the broken peg hole is typical of the tanged spearheads of this type

Tanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The attention to detail with the decorative facets around the head, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date. Bronze Age awls and narrow chisels are not common finds and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC, but maybe much later.

Description: The spearhead has been broken just over midway along the broad leaf shaped blade. Both edges where remaining has been heavily abraded along their edge, leaving them uneven. There is a pronounced conical mid rib that is hollow from the socket to the majority of the way through the blade. Where it has broken giving a cross-section of the rib shows it to be solid nearish to the point. There is a substantial mould line along the side of the shaft. There is only one loop on the spearhead, abutting the blade. There does not appear to be any breaks, swelling or any other suggestion that another loop existed on the other side. It is a small hemispherical loop



The spearhead is a dark brown colour with frequent patchesof rough light green corrosion product likely bronze disease.

Discussion:



This spearhead is odd for a number of reasons. Firstly single looped spearheads are very rare (with only one example to this date on the database: DUR-F54FE1), Those with abutting loops to the blade are similarly uncommon. Secondly these types are not known from the south-east and are more commonly found in Northern Britain and Ireland. Thirdly this exmaple from Kent while sharing identifying features does not fit all the attributes of the aformentioned northern and Irish groups and is, at present, unique in the archaeological record.","

766371,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-900,"A very late Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (1100 - 900 BC) Blackmoor type spearhead with lunate openings. The spearhead is complete and in very good condition although the blade edges are now a little uneven. The patina is dark green/brown and there are iron concretions in a number of places, especially around one of the openings. On one side there is a large area of green/blue thin coppery scale which extends from the socket to a point some two-thirds along the length of the object. A pronounced rib accompanies the openings along one side but is largely absent on the other. The length is 203mm and the width is 58.78mm. The diameter of the socket is 27.31mm and the socket is 147mm long. There are no traces of wood or other preserved organics within the socket. The presence of iron deposits suggests the spear was deposited within a wetland environment.



Richard Davis (Bronze Age specialist in Spearheads of University of Nottingham) comments:



This spearhead has transitional characteristics between the protected looped spearheads of the Middle Bronze Age and the lunate spearheads of the Late Bronze Age. The rib (ridge/flange/fillet) which runs all round the blade apertures is matched by a similar one on the spearhead from Ardmillam which I classified as protected-looped. The rib is larger and cruder than on the Late Bronze Age lunate spearheads. The blade shape with the strong concave line of the blade edges from above the lunates to the tip are present on several Late Bronze Age lunate spearheads, but is not as marked on protected-looped spearheads. The blade openings are larger than those of the protected-looped spearheads.



Based on these attributes this spearhead seems to be a transitional design somewhere in the continuum between the protected-looped, and the mature lunate spearheads typified by those from the Blackmoor hoard. This would date it to the late Middle Bronze Age (MBA III) or early Late Bronze Age (LBA I). The two protected-looped spearheads that have been tested had a low lead formulation typical of the Middle Bronze Age, while the lunate spearheads generally had a high lead formulation typical of Late Bronze Age metalwork. 



To date the metal of this spearhead has not been tested.

767708,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1150,"A nearly complete cast copper-alloy palstave type of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1550-1150 BC. The palstave has a U shaped shield-shaped pattern below the stop ridge on both sides of the palstave, which is concave, bordered on either side by the flange facets and with a central ridge in its middle. The cutting edge of the axe is convex and bevelled, while in section the piece is sub-lenticular and the blade is sub-triangular in plan view with convex flaring sides. At the middle of the depression below the stop ridge on the sides of the axe, the palstave has been slightly shouldered with two reasonably prominent ridges. The area of the axe comprising the stop-ridge and the butt with the septum in between is sub-triangular in section and sub-rectangular in plan-view, though at the upper edge of the axe this is irregular due to the breakage at the butt end. 



The palstave survives well with a relatively even green patina except for some small losses to the cutting edge and to the extremities of the butt end. In some places, the patina is relatively pitted with some brown mineralised deposits visible in places. 

It measures 152.65mm long from the broken end of the butt to the point of the blade, 30mm wide at the stop ridge, 28.65mm wide at the midpoint of the flange-facets and 23.18mm wide at the broken butt-terminal. The cutting edge of the axe is 56.86mm wide, and from the cutting edge to the stop-ridge the axe measures 85.81mm long. At the thickest point of the flange-facets the axe is 26.34mm thick and at the mid-point of the blade the axe is 12.68 mm thick. The axe weighs 488 grammes.

The tip and the socket are both broken and there are the remains of one side loop. The spearhead has a sharp ridge between the blades. The socket length is 47.59mm.



Richard Davis suggests that this spearhead can be identified as a Group 6 Developed Side-looped spearhead. It may be dated to the MBA - the later Acton Park and Taunton phases, and possibly the early part of the Penard phase. The lozenge shaped midrib and the prominent midrib ridge are typical of this type. There are remains of the top of the side loop at the bottom of the lower part of the socket remaining. Davis argues further that it appears that the spearhead was purposely damaged in antiquity with the tip and lower socket broken off, and the hole pierced in the lower midrib. This suggests some form of ritual destruction, possibly the weapon of a defeated opponent.

Beneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a concave depression, which is bordered by raised ridges. This is broadly sub-rectangular (U-shaped), with three parallel grooves going down to the septum to facilitate the process of hafting. One face of the palstave preserve, near the three grooves of the septum, a through hole linked with forging activities.

No visible casting flashes remain.



The metal has a mid-greenish-brown patina with pitting revealing a lighter green alloy. The hammer is 58.8mm long; 25mm x 15.3mm at the butt end; 19.6mm x 18.4mm at the socketed end; the walls are 4.5mm thick; the socket is 40.4mm deep. The object weighs. 83g.



Socketed hammers are a rare find, especially when compared to socketed axeheads, and there are currently only 37 recorded examples on the PAS database, 6 of which were found in Yorkshire. Similar hammers have been recorded as SF-40FAAD, FAKL-9C9543, LVPL-5A7954, SWYOR-D13642 and YORYM-ABCCE1. The latter record discusses the dating of socketed hammers stating that 'early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding'. SF-40FAAD also states that 'hammers were in use in Britain during the Taunton metalwork phase of the MBA, with slender hammers appearing in both the Taunton and Bishopsland hoards and a massive hammer in the Burgess's Meadow, Oxford hoard' (O'Connor 1980, vol.1, 61). However, they only became common in LBA hoards.

774654,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy sword blade, rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in profile and in section, with a raised but flattened mid-rib that rises about 1 mm above the surface of the blade on both sides and averages about 10 mm in width. Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is likely between the hilt and the middle of the sword as this is where the blade tapers before expanding at the mid point. The fragment may be a result of deliberate decomissioning of a sword into separate pieces before it was ritually destroyed, or it may have been broken up in order to melt it down and re-use the metal. The two broken edges look like they were subsequently trimmed in order to re-use the weapon as a tool such as a razor or scraper. The wider broken end has a semi-circular notch that is 5 mm in diameter and has been deliberately produced as part of a rivet hole and this would not be where the hilt was riveted to the handle so it must be for later hafting when the fragment was re-used. The smooth dark green patina survives on both faces of the blade but the abraded edges are actively corroding. There are also flakes and gashes that have been caused from post-depositional damage that are also corroding and are light green in colour.



The lozenge-shaped section of the blade with a raised central mid-rib suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.



Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate two similar lozenge-shaped sections of Ewart Park swords on page 135, fig.37, nos.386-7.

774801,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed axe, with just the blade surviving, rectangular in plan and in section, and triangular in profile. The blade is narrow with straight sides with a slight taper towards the broken end so that the blade is slightly flanged, but one side is damaged and incomplete so that the actual edge is unclear. The cutting edge of the blade is rounded and blunt, though affected by corrosive pitting and later damage. The broken end of the blade, which is 39 mm wide and 14.5 mm thick, is just below the end of the socket which would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has mostly corroded away, with patches of dark green patina, but much of the surface is covered in light green bronze disease. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, also refered to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but sparse. They date from the end of the Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase, and into Hallstatt C (c.800-700 BC).

The upper end has suffered an old break and is very worn. The fragment is ovoid in section towards the break and expands slightly in width at the centre. From this expansion, the lower section is triangular in section and tapers to a point which is rounded in plan. The sides of the lower section are slightly thicker than the flattened central area, possibly indicating that the edges had raised sides which are now worn to almost the same thickness as the rest of the fragment. It has a dark green patina and a smoothed surface.



Tanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The attention to detail with the decorative facets around the head, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date. Bronze Age awls and narrow chisels are not common finds and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC, but maybe much later.

776826,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"A fragment of Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1150BC) palstave axe-head, surviving only as the cutting edge and a tiny amount of the mid-rib body. The cutting edge is a wide convex crescent shape in plan. The blade is very short and has a steep drop from the body to the cutting edge, with some clear hammer blows and polishing striations visible on the surface. These features suggest an axe-head which has been maintained, the metal redrawn via hammering and re-sharpened a significant number of times. It is difficult to suggest the extent of this maintenance/reuse as palstaves dating from the latter end of the period tend to have shorter blades. Features to place this example within a chronological group have not survived, thus being able to suggest its shortness relates only to reuse and rather than style is not possible. At the broken end, which equates to the beginning of the palstave's likely rectangular body, a subtle shadow suggests the rib indicating its classification as a palstave axe. The break appears to be relatively recent and almost certainly relates to modern agricultural process. The fragment is very dark green on the body with a slightly different more olive green along the cutting edge.

776870,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A copper alloy fragment of a Socketed Spear head of Bronze Age date (1150-800 BC). The object is sub-triangular in shape, the tip, majority of the blade and part of the socket are missing due to old, abraded breaks. The socketed portion is circular and runs through the length of the object. The blades taper in toward the tip suggesting a leaf shaped form. There are retained casting seams at the base of the blade on each side.



The metal is a dark brown in colour with large areas of green corrosion.
