124479,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1300,"This is a possible chisel or awl. It is made from cast copper. The tool has a rectangular section. Three quarters of the length of the tool gradually tapers towards the terminal. This terminal is thought to be the blade. In profile it has a ‘>’ shape which Phil Watson (Principle Curator, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) suggests it may have been used as a chisel rather than an awl. The last quarter of the tool quickly tapers to a blunt point. The corners are rounded compared to the sharp corners on the rest of the tool. This final quarter also has a different corrosion pattern to the majority of the surface. The majority of the surface has traces of a dark green patina, otherwise it is a matte mottled brown/green colour. The final quarters’ surface is a light powdery green with patches of orange stains. This is probably the tang for the handle, and the thickening approximately a quarter from the handle terminal is probably where the handle was wedged in place.

The chisel measures 65.29mm long, 9.23mm wide and 7.32mm thick. It weighs 22.61g.

The chisel is possibly Bronze Age, if it is, the dating may be narrowed to the early Middle Bronze Age, c. 1500 to 1300 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-01-01T00:00:00Z,2006-01-26T00:00:00Z,,,,,,7.32,65.29,1,Phil Watson,Angie Bolton,Eastern,Hertfordshire,Dacorum,Berkhamsted,SP9518,,51.852518,-0.622122,WAW-C4A5F5,,WAW-C4A5F5.jpg,"Bronze Age Chisel (profile, upper view, profile, underside and blade tip) possibly",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-C4A5F5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/94112.jpg

The chisel has a blade which is square in section and tapers in thickness and slightly in width to a rounded blunt point. This terminal is abraded and probably does not represent the original edge. The blade is slightly bent at the mid point, which is not intentional, but it is not certain when this occurred. At the widest part of the blade there is an integral stop ridge. This ridge is sub-circular in plan and is perpendicular to the blade and tang. The blade protrudes from the centre of one face of the stop ridge, and the tang protrudes from the centre of the other face. The tang is square in section at the junction of the stop ridge, but tapers in thickness, and more slightly in width, similar to the blade, towards a blunt rounded point.

125316,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1120,"Bronze Age bronze socketed spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1500-1150BC, probably Taunton-Penard metalworking phase, c.1400-1120 BC (following Needham et al. 1997).



The spearhead is of side-looped type and is near-complete, missing only the base of the socket and the side loops. The spearhead has a surviving length of 82.70mm. The socket tapers towards the blade and has a maximum surviving diameter of 9.47mm. The remnants of the upper attachment only of the side loops are evident on each side of the socket. The socket has an oval hole (24.82mm x 5.6mm) on one side; the hole is likely to be a casting problem, probably as result of a misaligned core, rather than subsequent damage. The blade is eroded (with a maximum width of 11.03mm) and is leaf- or flame-shaped. The end of the socket develops into a high mid-rib, which converges towards the tip and gives the blade a lozenge shaped section. The spearhead has lost much of the original surface and now has a dark brown patina, with some areas of bronze around the hole in the socket. The spearhead weighs 16.7g.","The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and beyond, including Cadoxton-Juxta-Neath (Neath Port Talbot) Llanerfyl (Powys) and Nantwnlle (Ceredigion) (Savory, 1980, Nos. 227, 229 and 337 respectively). The Cadoxton-Juxta-Neath and Llanerfyl examples are of Acton Park metal, while the Nantwnlle example is of Cemmaes metal (ibid.).



This spearhead has been published by Richard Davis (2012, 105, No.638, Pl.36) within his Group 6 Unclassified (developed side-looped).



Davis notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades, which might strengthen the idea that this spearhead originally had a flame-shaped blade, rather than a leaf-shaped blade.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,16.7,,9.47,,82.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Llantrisant,,,,,NMGW-022DC1,,2005.208.jpg,Middle Bronze Age socketed spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.208.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/90045.jpg
127695,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1450,-1250,"A cast copper alloy palstave with central rib, shield shaped pattern below the stop ridge, and raised flange facets. The palstave dates from the Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150 BC). It measures 149.4mm long and weighs 451 grams.






The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 82.4mm long and the width of cutting edge is 58.2mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 7.2mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 18.9mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 31.9mm). Beneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a tapering central rib. This rib extends approximately half way down the length of the blade, terminating in a rounded point. The rib itself, although present on both sides, is crisper and less eroded on one of the two faces. Directly below the stop ridge is a concave depression which is bordered by raised ridges that join with the central rib to create a trident (3 pronged fork) like shield shape. The convex cutting edge of the blade is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This is partially due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion. On the lower part of the blade and the cutting edge are a series of small irregular crescent shaped hammer marks / scars which are most evident in oblique light. Many of these scars overlap. This suggests that the cutting edge has been reshaped and sharpened by hammering a number of times.






The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 65.1mm long, 16.3mm wide and 7.2mm thick. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The width at the butt is 24.8mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. However, one face of the axe has been severally damaged by abrasion and corrosion which renders comparison between the two faces difficult. Both sides of the axe are scarred with the remains of linear ribs which extend from the butt to the cutting edge. These ribs are from the two part mold used to cast the axe. Both edges have been trimmed and filed to remove any excess metal.






The palstave is a mid brown colour with a thick well formed patina which covers part of the surface of the axe. In a number of places the patina has been removed by abrasion, where this has occurred a light bright green copper corrosion has developed. It is likely that this corrosion has spread and affected 50% of the surface of the axe. The majority of the abrasion is located on one face of the axe. This confirms the finders' suggestion that the axe was located just above the interface between the ploughsoil and the undisturbed layers beneath. It is also noted that the weight of this axehead is extremely heavy in comparison to other similar examples; this is especially the case when the abrasion and damage is taken into account. Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in: Savory, 1980; Catalogue of the Bronze Age collections in the National Museum of Wales; entry 151 from Ceulan-y-maesmawr, Cardiganshire. This form and style of palstave fits into the Acton Park metal working tradition which is dated to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC.

130491,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,,"A probable Bronze Age knife of the Urnfield tradition. It measures 164mm in length (although it is slightly bent in profile) and with a max width of 28mm just behind the tang. The tang is a faceted circle in section, max 8mm diameter and 18.5mm long.
The top of the knife is 6mm wide, narrowing to the sharp blade which thins in width to the point.
Brendan O'Connor comments ""This is a single-edged tanged knife.  The turned-up point indicates that the blade is very worn.  There is decoration on the blade, but I cannot make it out very well.
 
This is a continental Urnfield type.  Without consulting many more sources than I have to hand, I would not like to say whereabouts it came from;  while it could be central Europe, these knives are also found in France.
 
Wear has distorted the form of the blade, though there still appears to be a curve on the back towards the tang.  The tang itself is plain, but tapering in form.  This makes a relatively simple form - many knives have more complex tangs, which I would say is neither very early (like the knife in the Penard phase hoard from Ffynonnau), nor characteristic of the latest Urnfield phase, Hallstatt B3 equivalent to Ewart Park/Carp's Tongue in Britain.  That would suggest an origin roughly equivalent to the British Wilburton phase, probably before 1000 BC, but would not necessarily date its deposition in Wiltshire as something of an antique"".

The decoration is grooved and on both faces of the knife takes the form of five three-rings-and-dot behind the tang. It is rather jagged in places and gives the impression of a curvy edge to the rings.
Between these and the point of the knife, again on both sides, are three incised lines between which are two lines of Us, one line of which are inverted.
The decoration is rather crude and along the lines are several places where the line is wider than need be. Another curiousity is an apparant thin line of copper alloy added after the decoration, running across it vertically. It is only 1mm wide but clearly was applied afterwards - for what reason? Perhaps to cover a mistake, though it is rather randomly placed when much of the knife is quite crude.
The patina is very shiny and the metal a yellowy brassy colour. The tang and tip of the knife have darker green areas of patination. One side of the blade may have been recently cleaned - very shiny yellow-bronze diagonal striations show on the surface.
The knife weighs 96.71g. While it is very likely this is a knife of the Urnfield tradition, it is very unlikely that it was deposited in Wiltshire at the time. It may then be a more recent loss.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-02-10T00:00:00Z,,,,1.36,,,1,15,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Chirton,SU0757,From a paper map,51.312072,-1.900955,WILT-658D62,,Knife.jpg,(Possibly) Bronze Age knife,Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Knife.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/99404.jpg

130594,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-950,-800,"A Late Bronze Age socketed gouge made from cast copper alloy. The gouge is complete, but the surface is in poor condition. Approximately half of the patina remains otherwise the surface is pitted and has areas of corrosion. The patina is a mottled dark green colour. The gouge is a sub-rectangle in plan, with the socketed terminal being slightly flared. It measures 95.41mm long and weighs 74.5g. The socket is circular in section, 13.85mm diameter, and tapers in the internal diameter. The opposite terminal, the blade edge is ‘C’ shaped in section. The blade is the terminal of a elongated triangular groove on the upper surface of the gouge. This groove starts 23mm from the socket and gradually increases in depth and width towards the blade terminal. Patina remains in the groove and has fine striations running from the mid point of the groove to the blade edge.

The gouge dates to the late Bronze Age, c.1150 to c.800 BC. Similar examples are found in Watson (Watson, P. 1993 Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums BAR British Series 233) illustrates two gouges, but one is decorated with ribbing (No. 72), and the second (No. 73) is undecorated, but is shorter, and the length of the groove is considerably shorter than the recorded example. A more similar example is illustrated in Annable and Simpson (Annable, F. and Simpson D. 1964 Guide Catalogue of the Neolithic and Bronze Age Collections in Devizes Museum Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society), No. 645.  Gouges were used as wood-working tools. 

Dr. Adam Gwilt (National Museum and Galleries of Wales) commented on the gouge;  “Plain forms are the most common from the Late Bronze Age. Where dated by association, they usually belong to the Ewart Park phase (950-800BC). Examples with mouth mouldings tend to be earlier and belonging to the Wilburton / Blackmoor phases (1150-920BC)”",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-01-01T00:00:00Z,2006-02-21T00:00:00Z,,,,,13.85,,95.41,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Wyre Forest,Ribbesford,SO7673,From a paper map,52.354533,-2.353801,WAW-890416,,WAW-890416 Drawing.jpg,"Bronze Age Gouge (top, reverse, and section) ",Candy Stevens,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-890416 Drawing.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/99635.jpg

This artefact has an incomplete circular socketed terminal at one end (diameter: as above; thickness of metal: 2mm), with the inside of the chisel being hollow to the opposing tip.  To the either side of the chisel’s length, there is a singular casting line or mark (average width: 1.5mm) ‘of the joint of the mould in which it was cast’ (Evans, 1881, page 172).  From the incomplete socketed mouth of the chisel, the form and length of the artefact adapts into an angular and ‘V’-shaped section, which then narrows to a point at the chisel edge.  The artefact is in a slightly worn but good condition with a dark green patina and small infrequent areas of pitting on the surface.

A similar example is illustrated in Evans, J, 1881, ‘The Ancient Bronze Implements, Weapons and Ornaments of Great Britain and Ireland’, pages 171-2, fig 200, which was found as part of a hoard from Carlton Rode, Norfolk, which Evans comments is well adapted for cutting mortises.

Other similar examples of socketed chisels are also illustrated in the Archaeological Journal Vol IV (1849), page 382, found at Westow, Yorkshire, and in the Archaeological Journal IX (1852), pages 302-3, found at Romford, Essex.

Treasure report written by Dr S.P. Needham: The fragment comprises one end of a ribbon of gold the sides converging in a convex curve towards a perforated terminal. The long edges are thickened outside a light crease inset by 1mm. The terminal's end has been torn off leaving just half of the perforation extant.


The ribbon has a number of buckles and a partial fracture crossing transversely at one point.","Treasure report written by Dr S.P. Needham: This is very likely to be an ancient object (over 300 years old) and may be of future research interest if better parallels come to light.













The incomplete nature of this object and the lack of diagnostic features makes it difficult to identify its original form. A range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings. It is possible that the Brixham Deverill fragment belongs to this repertoire and the composition of the metal would not be inconsistent with such a date.

 











Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 85-87 %, a silver content of 11-13 %, the remainder being copper. The fragment weighs 1.23 grams.

In plan the axe is a sub elongated trapezoid with a rounded butt and flared blade. The butt is rounded, and in profile tapers to a rounded edge. The edges of the septum and body are slightly raised, forming a slight flange. The blade flares outwards, but the blade tips are abraded and therefore rounded. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical which may be due to wear rather than abrasion. In profile the blade forms a ‘>’.

The chisel is comparatively small, with a distorted length of 50.83mm (c. 54mm undistorted). The artefact is thickest at its middle (at 3.18mm) and thins to the blade and tang end. The sides are divergent and straight along the tang and gently curved along the blade. The blade edge has a width of 16.84mm and is also gently curved. Little of the original surface survives, which appears to have had a black patination. The current surface is mid-green to brown. The chisel weighs 6.2g. Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the chisel was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The object was examined whole within the specimen chamber and analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. A scrape along one edge of the object allowed analysis of the metal in this area. Unfortunately the electron beam was too unsteady to obtain reliable semi-quantitative results, but a series of readings showed that the object was of tin bronze; neither zinc nor lead were present in detectable quantities. The suggested composition would be broadly consistent with Middle Bronze Age metal composition, perhaps Taunton or Cammaes metalworking.","This chisel has proved difficult to closely parallel, although the form and style seem consistent with Bronze Age types. The Sparkford Hill Hoard, Somerset (Smith Ed., 1959, Inventaria Archaeologia; An Illustrated Card-Inventory of Important Associated Finds in Archaeology; Great Britain 7th Set: GB. 42-47) contained a larger chisel of similar form and dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age. A similar chisel found at Monkton, Pembrokeshire (Savory 1980, pp. 117, No 265) was dated through associated artefacts to the 11th or 10th century BC.

Taunton / Cemmaes metalworking falls within Needham's (1996) Period 5, c. 1500 - 1150 BC. The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 163mm and weighs 494.8g. The butt is square and irregular with a width of 20.7mm and has a thickness of 4.0mm. The sides are slightly convex as far as the stop and are then straight and divergent before flaring to the expanded blade. The palstave is wider around the flanges (26.2mm), than on the blade near the stop (19.8mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished (by hammering and filing), with particular attention paid to the blade area and the unlooped side. The loop is wide at 11.5mm. The septum is rounded and concave with a straight stop, which meets the septum at a right angle. The flange facets meet the septum before the butt and are highest (37.3mm) at the stop. The stop has a height of 14.3mm above the septum and rises 9.4mm above the blade. The blade is decorated with a weak mid rib and side ribs. The ribs are defined by two small cast hollows (c. 20-28mm long and 3-4mm wide) flanking each rib. The blade has a maximum thickness below the stop of 23.7mm and gradually thins to 12.9mm at the prominent blade facet. Hammer dimples are evident on the blade facets of both faces. Some sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge are discernible. A single casting flaw on the septum of one face is visible. The palstave has good surface preservation and has a dark green to black patina.","In form this palstave appears similar to Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Group III, it should be noted that the breadth of the stop/flanges, and the height above the septum, is very significant. Typically, low-flanged palstaves have a stop/flange breadth of no more than approx. 31mm and a stop/flange height around 10mm. A breadth of 37.1mm is closer to the criteria as defined for south-western palstaves, though that type are also characterised by angular flanges that rise above the height of the stop (Smith 1959). Examples with high flanges that do not rise above the height of the stop are known from Somerset, such as one found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012).

132960,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"Copper alloy flat axehead dating to the Early Bronze Age.  It belongs to the phase I classification of types  (c. 2500 – 1450 B.C.) in Savoury’s Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections of the National Museum of Wales and appears to be of Migdale tradition.  It is not one of the earliest types of axe due to the flared blade and central thickening, which were improvements on the earliest types.

The convex blade is splayed on either side by roughly 10mm and the butt is slightly rounded.  Across the axehead run concentric ridges mimicking the shape of the blade.  The cutting edge remains quite sharp although the outer surface has flaked away in some places since discovery.

The longitudinal section is lozengic, created by a slight transverse median ridge and tapered ends.  This thickening at the centre was an attempt to prevent the blade from moving in the handle and ultimately damaging it.

The body flares evenly to the blade end of the object.  The blade flares out from the body with an even curviture to the edge.  The edge remains fairly sharp, though an imperfection in the metal has left a small semicircular divet in the center of the edge.  At the points of the blade, the width of the axe is 60mm.

The haft end is roughly squared, and it is difficult to tell whether this is the original butt or if butt broke off the object, the broken edges then smoothed slightly.  The butt measures 27mm in width.

The surface of the axe has an even grey-green patina, though where pitting occurs (always less than 1.5mm in diameter) the color is a light tinted green.  There are also patches of iron oxidation that seem to be integral to the object.

The oval profile of the socket narrows the further it extends into the main blade, becoming flat approximately 10mm short of the top.  The sides of the socket are slightly concave and lead into the main body of the spear.  The edges are very worn and appear not to reflect the objects original profile.  The blade edges flare downwards and outwards from the socket in a 'mushroom' shape.  The surface of the object is covered in a very thick layer of greyish mineralised deposit that also covers the inside of the socket as far as is visible.  There is a small area where the surface patina has come off on one side of the socket in between the line of the blade beginnings.  This area reveals two moulded decorative bands set horizontally around the socket.

135647,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1000,"An incomplete cast copper alloy rapier, dating from the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age, between 1300 – 1000 BC (length: 120mm; width at shoulder: 45mm; thickness at mid blade: 5.5mm; weight: 76.6g).  The artefact can probably be classified as a Trump Group II: Thetford Class rapier (see Trump, B, A, V, 1962, ‘The Origin and development of British Middle Bronze Age Rapiers’ in ‘Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society’, pages 80 – 102.

Only part of the butt, shoulder and blade remain.  In plan, the artefact is an inverted and elongated sub-triangle with a convex side-section.  The sides curve inwards below the shoulder/ butt to form the incomplete tapering blade (width at broken end of blade: 19mm).  At the shoulder/ butt of the rapier, there are two probably deliberate notches instead of rivet holes in opposing corners to the left and right, with an approximate diameter of 11mm, and a slightly incomplete straight edge above and between the rivet holes, forming a trapezoidal appearance at the top of the artefact.  A worn but prominent midrib is evident on both sides of the rapier commences from the butt, with an additional rib to either side which follows the curve of the each shoulder.  All three ribs continue to the break half way down the blade.  The blade edge is slightly incomplete in all areas due to corrosion and old breaks.  Overall, the artefact is in a worn but fair condition with a slightly pitted surface and little of the original green/ brown patina remaining.

Similar examples are illustrated in Trump’s paper (see details above), particularly on page 85, figs 10 (found at the River Ouse, Thetford) & 11 (found at the River Shannon), which are both of the Group II Thetford Class.  On page 87, Trump states that the distinguishing feature of this class is that instead of rivet holes, the rapiers have punched (probably) penannular and deliberate notches at the corners of the butt, as well as the strongly moulded blade with an arris.  Although no moulds of this rapier have ever been found before 1962, they have a wide distribution with a prominent number found in the Fens (where they seem to have generated from in England) as well as others from around England, but a large number have been found in Ireland and Scotland.

The first part of the artefact is the incomplete butt and shoulder (length: 62.5mm; width: see above; thickness of shoulder: 5mm; weight: 40.6g).  The butt has a flat-sectioned rounded top with the remains of two incomplete rivet holes in opposing corners to the left and right, with an approximate diameter of 8mm (both rivets are missing).  The butt is also broken (an old break) and incomplete below the rivet holes, but the sides of the shoulder below curve inwards to form the start of a tapering blade.  This first part of the artefact, however, is broken (an old break) approximately 27mm below where the shoulder of the dirk begins to taper inwards.

The second part of the dirk (length: 61mm; width: 16.5mm; thickness at mid blade: see above; weight: 23.7g) immediately and precisely follows on from the break to the butt and shoulders with a fragment of the convex-sectioned mid blade, which still tapers inwards.  The blade edge to either side is worn and incomplete.

The third and final part of the artefact (length: 43mm; width: 12.5mm; thickness: 5.5mm; weight: 10.9g) continues approximately from where the mid blade fragment of the preceding part broke.  This third piece is also a fragment of the convex-sectioned blade, which is just slightly tapering, possibly indicating that this bottom fragment was broken or corroded just above the tip.

Down the central length of the top two sections, the dirk has a flat mid rib, which commences at the shoulder of the artefact and continues to follow the length of the blade approximately 4mm from the blade edge, which tapers downwards from this point.

137216,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy barbed and tanged arrowhead, dating to the Bronze Age, between 2150 - 800 BC (length: 42mm; width at barbs: 28mm; thickness: 2mm; weight: 7.67g).


The haft end of a flat arrowhead with bevelled blade edges to the left and right on the outside of the barbs, which is also visible on both sides of the artefact.  The barbs are both broken but have a surviving length of 5mm (measured at the longest surviving barb), a width of 7mm with a thickness of 2mm.  The outside blade edges of the arrowhead slant inwards to taper towards the blade tip, which is no longer present as approximately 20mm of the artefact is now missing.  On one side of the arrowhead, the notches between the tang and the barbs are facetted with a recession of 6mm.  The slightly incomplete (due to corrosion) sub-rectangular and flat tang, which tapers to a thin rounded point at the tip is 19mm long, 9.5mm wide and 2mm thick, with the outside edges down the length of the tang also slightly bevelled.  The arrowhead is in a slightly worn but good condition with a light brown patina, although there are numerous tiny scratches on both sides, which appear to have been done recently, possibly due to cleaning.


An identical example has already been recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database by Dr Helen Geake (SF6680), and was found by metal detecting in Bradfield Combust with Stanningfield in Suffolk. Dr. Geake states that the Suffolk example also has the notches between the tang and the barbs on one side only, which suggests that that the artefact 'may be cast rather than created as a secondary process.  If this is the case, the object must have been manufactured as an arrowhead rather than being made as a secondary process from a fragment of another artefact; this makes it extremely rare'.  Dr. Geake also states that 'tanged (usually with barbs) copper-alloy arrowheads are known from the late bronze Age in Britain and western Europe, though they are rare'.  However, the Suffolk example, according to Dr. Geake, is more in common wit early Bronze Age forms and may be of this date, which at the time of writing the Suffolk record, would make it the only Early Bronze Age example known from Britain, therefore making this example also incredibly rare.

The flat axe is complete and has an overall length of 150.4mm and weighs 503.9g. The butt is square with a width of 24mm and is tapered to a thickness of 3mm. The sides are divergent and are straight for some 50mm before they become concave to the expanded blade. The sides are moderately flat across their thickness, but appear to have been hammered towards the centre. The axe is thickest near its centre at 11.5mm. The blade is wide at 88.69mm with only a slightly curved blade edge. The blade facet begins 10mm from the current (eroded) blade edge. Both faces are gently convex and no decoration is evident. One face has a prominent casting flaw, probably caused by an air bubble (8mm diameter, 3.4mm deep) within a hollowed area. The axe has a green brown patina with peripheral areas of surface loss (light to mid green colour). One face is currently suffering from active bronze corrosion.

The axe is incomplete, missing the blade, the mouth and loop, giving the axe a surviving length of 80.87mm and weight of 229.0g. The surviving mouth is uneven and irregular because of insufficient bronze to fill the mould during casting. The mouth has an oval profile with external dimensions of 46.95mm x 38.28mm (37.85 x 30.55mm internal). One face is higher at the mouth and appears to be turning out slightly, before it would have formed a slight mouth moulding. There is no evidence for whether the casting process employed a two-runner or four-runner technology. The collar is deep (26mm) and is concave on the more complete face. The remains of the loop begin beneath the mouth and are confined within the collar. The casting seams are prominent on both sides but have been finished. The sides are straight, but are beginning to flare outwards at the break. Beneath the collar, the axe has a sub-rectangular body profile.

The fitting has areas of good surface preservation with a mid-brown patina.","These fittings are unusual finds and can be paralleled with examples in a hoard of Late Bronze Age decorative strap fittings and horse-gear found at Abergele, Conwy (Savory, 1980, pp 119, Nos. 269-271) of Wilberton metalworking phase, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 6 dated to, to c. 1,150 - 950BC.

Almost all original patina is missing and no original cutting edge survives. It is extensively worn. The tip is missing.

In section the spearhead has a circular shaft (6.6mm diameter), apparantly with a clay fill, if so presumably left over from the casting process and creating a weak point for the spear to snap at.

The spearhead has a prominent mid-rib. From its current outline (although heavily worn and damaged) it is probably Greenwell and Brewis Type Va, and would have had peg-holes for attachment instead of loops.

The incomplete object measures 49mm in length and is c.24.1mm wide at the cutting edge, which is 0.8mm thick. Where the blade extends from the tang it is 5.6mm thick. It is trinagular at this point, extending from an oval sectioned piece of tang extending below the collar.

The oval collar 14.8x13mm, 3.3mm thick spearates the main tang (the broken stump of which is c.9x7mm and oval) and blade (which thins out of the tang below the collar.

The casting flashes on the sides of the blade have been worn down but are just visible. Where the blade is broken it has been bent upwards. it is a relatively old break.

The patina is green, smooth and shiny.

The find was first identified as a palstave however the height of the flanges and their length combined with the lack of a stopridge make this unlikely. On the available evidence this is closer in form to a long flanged axehead see for example LVPL-558FA2 on the database. The long flanges will classify this either as a long flanged axehead or a developed flat axe. The flanges appear to be cast favouring the former type, although the diverging sides may indicate the latter. In either circumstance this form dates to the Early Bronze Age c. 1750-1500 cal BC (Following Roberts et al 2013).

143349,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2400,-2200,"Early Bronze Age (or Metal-Using Neolithic) copper flat axe, falling within Needham et al.'s (forthcoming) Class 2D, Type Halberton, or probably of Type Growtown / Milton Moss (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981).



The axe is near-complete with only a little damage to the edges and has a length of 98.55mm and weighs 325.1g. The butt has suffered a little damage making the type identification difficult and slightly speculative, but appears to have been straight with a surviving width of 32.9mm and a thickness of 4.5mm. The sides of the axe are comparatively straight and are very slightly concave. The sides are also straight across their thickness, giving the axe a rectangular profile. The axe has a maximum width at the blade of 66.21mm. The blade edge has a shallow curve and is unexpanded. Both faces of the axe are convex, producing a lenticular long profile, with a maximum thickness 38mm from the blade of 12.89mm. The surface of the axe has differential preservation, with a pale green to pale brown patina.","Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency and to make the analyses comparable with other results. Results obtained suggest the axe has a composition made up nearly entirely of copper and is broadly consistent with Northover's (1980, pp 230) metal type 'A'. Metallurgical sampling of the axe may provide greater accuracy on the metallurgical composition. Axes of this type can be attributed to Metalwork Assemblage II, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 1 of the British Bronze Age. The axe is likely to date to between c. 2,400 - 2,200BC",3,Copper,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,325.1,,,4.5,98.55,1,Sian Williams,Sian Williams,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Cwm Gwaun,SM9935,From a paper map,51.977015,-4.928003,NMGW-24F646,,200666.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200666.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629333.jpg

The side loop is located 12.40mm from the mouth of the socket, the external width of the loop is: 17.17mm, internal width: 5.51mm. Just below the side loop, on the socket, there are two oval depressions, one on each side of the socket. These oval depressions extend partially around the front and reverse surfaces. After the depressions the blade starts and it is clearly defined by a step down from the socket. The blade has a crisp rectangular cross-section and it gently expands towards the curved cutting edge (width from: 28.35mm expanding to 37.17mm). There are visible hammer marks on the surface of the blade and the hammering has created a clear bevel at the cutting edge. There are some edge losses to the cutting edge and one corner is missing, however this may be post depositional damage. There are some casting flashes remaining around the mouth of the socket and along the sides. There are no internal ribs on the socket. The copper alloy has a dark brown patina.

145195,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed gouge, dating to the Late Bronze, between c. 1150 – c. 800 BC (length: 69mm; diameter at mouth 17.5mm; width at gouge end: 14.5mm; thickness at gouge end: 8mm; weight: 36.5g).

The gouge (used as a wood-working tool) is sub-rectangular in plan, with a circular and slightly flared socketed terminal at one end. At the opposing end, the curved blade edge is ‘C’ shaped in section with an elongated triangular or ‘V’ shaped groove on the upper surface of the gouge. This groove (length: 37mm) commences 33mm from the open socket and gradually increases in depth and width towards the blade terminal.  At 8.5mm below the open socketed mouth of the gouge, there is a single moulded ridge running across the artefact’s circumference.  There is a casting line still visible to the left and right down the length of the artefact and at either side of the triangular or V’ shaped groove, therefore clearly indicating that this artefact was cast in a mould. These casting lines interrupt the single moulded ridge below the socketed mouth.  Overall, the artefact is in a slightly worn but good condition with a dark brown patina. There does not appear to be any wood surviving in the socket of the gouge.

Two similar examples are illustrated in Watson, P, 1993, ‘Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums’, BAR British Series 233. One of these examples is decorated with ribbing (No. 72), and the second (No. 73) is undecorated.

Another similar example is illustrated in Smith, R, A, 1920, ‘British Museum: A Guide to the Antiquities of the bronze Age in the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities’, page 47, fig 33 amongst other finds that were also discovered at Heathery Burn Cave, co. Durham.  Although the gouge V-shaped recess is longer, there is a similar single moulded ridge below the open socketed mouth of the artefact.

According to Pearce, S, M in the 1983 publication ‘The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I’, page 43, socketed gouges ‘appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age’, although most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 – c. 800 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-09-25T23:00:00Z,,,,36.5,,17.5,8,69,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Swinfen and Packington,SK1405,From finder,52.642564,-1.794534,WMID-634197,,WMID-634197.JPG,"Bronze Age socketed gouge (front, side and back views)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-634197.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/116854.jpg

145242,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A slightly incomplete cast copper alloy socketed and side-looped spearhead (Davis Group 2), dating to the Late Bronze Age, between c. 1150 - c. 800 BC (length: 79.5mm; width at blade: 22mm; diameter at socket mouth: 15.5mm; weight: 47.5g).



This artefact is a leaf-shaped spearhead with the remains of a pointed tip. The blade wings to either side of the tapering midrib are incomplete and badly corroded, but their overall shape remains, with the blade wings to either side of the midrib measuring at 7mm in width and 2.5mm thick. The width of the midrib at the tip measures 4.5mm, which then expands to approximately 10.5mm where the blades to either side terminate. Additionally, the midrib is diamond-shaped in section where the blade wings appear to either side, but then expands outwards and continues in length to form a circular sectioned socket 35mm from where the blade wings terminate. At approximately 10mm below the blade wings, there are the remains of side-loops to either side of the socket, with a casting ridge also present either side and in line with these loops, indicating the casting manufacturing process. The circular socketed terminal is complete and still completely filled with earth. Overall, the artefact is in a worn and corroded condition with some areas of bronze disease, particularly on the blade wings and midrib. One side of the spearhead survives better than the other and there are still large areas where the original dark green patina remains.



Similar examples are illustrated in H N Savory's 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections', 1980, pages 112 & 175, fig 27, ref nos 227-229, which are all examples of socket-looped spearheads, found at Cadoxton-juxta-Neath, Glamorgan; Llanfair Clydogau, Cardiganshire and Llanerfyl, Montgomeryshire respectively.

145258,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed axehead (of probable 'Trehou' type), dating to the Late Bronze Age, between c. 1150 – c. 800 BC (length: 114mm; width at side loop: 35.5mm; thickness at socket mouth: 28mm; weight: 197.33g).

The long and narrow axehead is sub-rectangular in plan, with a triangular side section and a square socketed mouth.  Most of the original blade edge has corroded away, but the blade still has a distinctive curved blade that has tapered to a thin edge.  The axehead tapers outwards from the blade to form the triangular section.  At approximately 79.5mm from the blade edge and 11.5mm from the scoketed mouth, there is a rounded/ arched cast copper alloy side loop (length: 21.5mm; width: 5.5mm; inner length of the loop: 10.5mm) integral to the main body of the axehead.  Additionally, the axehead is decorated by two parallel recessed ridges (approximate length: 3mm) immediately below the socketed mouth.  The first ridge commences 5mm below the mouth of the socket and there is a gap of 5mm again between the first and second ridge.  The second ridge is interrupted by the top terminal of the side loop.  The square socketed mouth is complete although worn along the edges.  Importantly, there is a substantial amount of wood surviving inside the socket (length of remaining wood: 48.5mm; diameter: 15mm; weight: 1.81g), which is now in a completely dry state and is strained green, presumably from being inside the copper alloy axehead for a long period of time.  Overall, the axehead, although worn, corroded, pitted and with very little of the original light brown patina remaining, is in a fair condition, particularly due to a large amount of wood surviving inside the socket.

A number of similar examples (with identical decoration around the socket) are illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', pages 16-17, ref nos 166-173, most of which were found in France.",,4,Copper alloy,Wood,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-06-30T23:00:00Z,2006-07-30T23:00:00Z,,,197.33,,,28,114,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Staffordshire Moorlands,Horton,SJ9358,Centred on village (which isn't a parish),53.119129,-2.106044,WMID-6640F5,,WMID-6640F5.JPG,"Bronze Age socketed axehead (front, side and back)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-6640F5.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/116853.jpg

145721,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Copper alloy low-flanged axe.



This bronze Early Bronze Age flanged axe has a long slender body with near parallel sides, which suddenly expand widely, to produce a crescentic shaped blade and asymmetric cutting edge. The butt end of the axe has been slightly damaged in antiquity and therefore the original shape is not apparent. Part way down the body of the axe is a median bevel, whilst the sides of the axe are rounded. Surface pitting on these sides precludes the possibility of knowing whether or not they were once decorated. Both faces of the axe were once decorated, although most decoration has been removed from one face by surface corrosion. On the well preserved surface there is ripple ornament executed by hammering, over which a complex design has been incised. Immediately beneath the median bevel is a narrow zone of herringbone, followed by four lines of infilled chevrons, parallel to the rippling and the cutting edge of the blade. This is succeeded by four lines of herringbone and then four lines of infilled chevron. Bordering this is a further chevron line, this time infilled in reverse to the other chevrons. This is finally bounded by a line of herringbone, which stops 24mm above the blade edge. This decoration is largely complete, although a small part has been removed by surface pitting at the blade end. Straitions on the original surface near the cutting edge indicates some sharpening of the blade occurred. The axe has a dark green patina, with lighter green surfaces within the areas of pitting. The axe has evidently been coated with a varnish or lacquer, as indicated by its lustre. Blade width 73.2mm, butt width 25.3mm, maximum length 149.0mm, maximum thickness (including flanges) 15.6mm, maximum depth of flanges 2.0mm, distance of median bevel from butt end 61.5mm and weighs 370.8g.","This artefact may be identified as a bronze flanged axe of Needham's (1983) Class 5, equivalent to Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Type Arreton, belonging to period 4 of the British Early Bronze Age and dating to between 1700-1500calBC (Needham et al 1985; Needham 1996). These are the first true flanged axes, used at the same time that tanged spearheads, Camerton-Snowshill daggers and Collared Urns were in circulation. Parallels for this axe within the National Collections are examples from the Ebnal and Menai Bridge Hoards, which both possess bands of short incision decoration below the bevel to the blade (Savory 1980, Cat. Nos.259 and 260). Comparable decoration of hatching and chevrons can be observed on examples from White Horse Hill (Osmington), Dorset, and Stuntney, Cambridgeshire (Needham 1983, Fig.58, Ds 5, Ca 13). These latter two examples, and the Menai Bridge axe, all possess hammered decoration along the sides of the flanges.

Migdale axes lack features such as median bevels, raised edges and the narrow straight-sided form frequently associated with decoration (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35)/  Attempts to subdivide the type on the basis of variation in form have been unsuccessful; graphs plotting indices of shape such as length, width and the ratios of the body width at various points along the length of the axe do not show  discrete concentrations (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 35).  The Caswell bay example is closely paralleled by the example from Glangwenlais Quarry, llandybie, Carmarthenshire (Savory 1962-64; Savory 1980, 101 no.112 fig. 17).

147156,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"This bronze casting jet represents the by-product of the manufacture of a socketed axe.  The jet is of a roughly circular form and displays all four runners.  The four runners together with its geographic location strongly hint at the jet being removed from an axe of type Storgursey or 'South Wales Type'.  The patina on the casting jet varies from a brown to light green and the jet now displays a sheen due to polish or lacquer applied by the finder.  The external diameter of the jet is 39.2mm - 45.3mm, with an internal diameter of 16.4mm - 19.3mm.  The jet has a maximum thickness of 15.6mm.  The distance between the runners is 31.6mm and 29.5mm, implying an axe of usual proportions around its mouth, possibly with a square socket.  The jet has a weight of 52.1g.","The casting jet can be securely ascribed to the Ewart Park tradition of metalworking, belonging to Needham's (1996) metalworking stage 7.  For some time it has been realised Stogursey axes can be placed at the end of the Bronze Age and this has recently been varified by Needham et.al (1997), making it possible to place production between 950-750 cal. BC.
This find represents the only complete example of a casting jet with four runners in Wales the author is aware of.  The nearest welsh parallels are the jet associated with the St. Mellons hoard, Cardiff and a possible example from Penwyllt, Ystradgynlais.  In Needham's (1981) catalogue of Stogursey axes he lists seven examples, six of which are associated with the Stogursey Hoard, the other is from Lelant, Cornwall.  Evans (1881) records another from Kenidjack Cliff, Cornwall, associated with socketed axes.
It has been noted elsewhere (needham 1981, Brigs and Williams 1995, Northover) the discrepency between the majority of finds of Stogursey axes in South East Wales and stone molds from Southern England.

148063,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1150,"Cast incomplete copper alloy socketed chisel, wedge-shaped in profile and sub-rectangular in plan, with sub-parallel sides. The sides, when looking at the face of the chisel, are slightly concave along the length, curving outwards towards the blade. The chisel is a light to dark green colour and heavily corroded and pitted. The blade has a curved edge which is worn, and fragments of the edge have been broken off in the past, but it appears to mainly follow the original edge with no flaring of the tips. There are scars on both faces that are probably the result of plough damage. The hollow interior is cone-shaped, with the socket ending 20 mm up from the blade. The cross-section of the chisel is sub-rectangular with the walls ranging from 2.5 mm to 2.8 mm in thickness. The chisel is missing its butt end and was probably about 70-80 mm in length originally. The shape and curve of the blade suggest that this might have been a tool for carving wood, with the rounded edge enabling the carver to work with a concave area. The angle of the bevel, at about 20°, would have made it ideal for fine work where thin slivers of wood were being removed. Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar example on page 132, No.175, which is dated to the Penard period, c.1300-1150 BC. Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar but complete example from Cottonwood, Bodmin, on page 401, Plate 2, No.12, which is dated to the Taunton-Penard phase c.1400-1200 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-07-19T23:00:00Z,,,,35.75,,,13.6,56,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Paul,SW4625,GPS (from the finder),50.070736,-5.551014,CORN-4E8A63,,mixfinds 016.jpg,Bronze Age socketed chisel (blade),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/mixfinds 016.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/118871.jpg

149073,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Early Bronze Age, Bronze cast-flanged axe whose sides are straight and near parallel, curving outwards markedly near the blade, giving a splayed blade.  The artefact has a flat shaped butt end, which tapers in section.  Unusually, the butt end of the axe is pierced by a circular hole (6mm in diameter).  This was made with care in antiquity, possibly by drilling into the metal with a circular implement from each side of the artefact, the hole breaking through the middle (as suggested by its slightly hourglass shaped profile).  The hole is slightly offset from the centre of the butt, and begins 9mm from the butt end.  The axe has a pitted surface appearance with a brown and black coloured iron rich encrustation on the surface, probably deriving from the burial environment of the artefact.  Metallic Bronze is revealed in small areas along the flange top on one side of the implement.  Length 96.5mm, blade width 51.0mm, butt width 17.0mm, maximum thickness 13.0mm, flange depths c.2.0mm, weight 111.5g.

This is an undecorated Type Derryniggin flanged axe belonging to the Inch Island-Derryniggin metalwork tradition of the Early Bronze Age (Harbison 1969).  It can be assigned to Period 4 and Metalwork Assemblage 6 of the British Bronze Age, dating from 1700-1500cal BC (Needham 1996).","Parallels for this flanged axe have been found at Bryn Coch, Blaenrhonddan, Neath (Savory 1980, Cat.No.121) and Margam, Neath-Port Talbot (Savory 1980, Cat.No.122).  The characteristic metalwork products of this period were flanged axes, tanged and end looped spearheads and Camerton-Snowshill daggers (see Burgess 1980).  These are rare in Wales however, by comparison with Inch Island products in Ireland and Arreton products in southern and eastern England (Burgess and Cowen 1972).  It is possible that the axe was made within Wales, as the product of a small scale metalworking centre, and this is a question which might be approached through metallurgical analysis of the impurities within this bronze artefact.  During the past fifteen years copper mines have been found in Wales, and dated to the Early and Middle Bronze Age, using radiocarbon dating method, and therefore a Welsh source is a possibility.

The reason for piercing the object at the butt end is not immediately clear, and is a rare occurance on comparable flanged axes of this date.  The hole may have been associated with the securing of the haft to the blade, have been used for suspension in some way, or pierced as a deliberate act prior to its deposition.",4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,1999-06-25T23:00:00Z,,,,111.5,,,13,96.5,1,Adam Gwilt,Sian Williams,Wales,Swansea,Swansea,Mumbles,SS6390,From a paper map,51.59214348,-3.97911853,NMGW-EF8FC1,,,,,,,https://bronze-age-index.micropasts.org/img.png

The axe has an overall length of 106.95mm and weighs 176.7g. The butt has suffered some damage, but is narrow and short with a surviving width of 16mm and would have been rounded or possibly even pointed. The sides are straight and diverge gradually to the unexpanded blade. The sides are rounded across their thickness, giving the axe an oval section. The blade has a width of 59.04mm and has a shallow blade edge. The narrow butt, straight sides and shallow edge produce a markedly triangular form to the axe. The faces are gently convex, producing a moderate lenticular long profile. The axe is thickest around its midpoint at 10.02mm. The axe has poor surface preservation with a pale brown patina, areas of the sides and faces have active corrosion.","Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency and to make the analyses comparable with other results. Results obtained suggest the axe is made of bronze and is broadly consistent with Early Bronze Age metal types. Metallurgical sampling of the axe would provide greater accuracy on the metallurgical composition. The triangular axe form with straight sides diverging to the unexpanded blade edge would not be consistent with the more common Migdale axe type.

152331,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-900,-700,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of South Wales (or Stogursey) Type and dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 7 and dated to c. 950 - 750BC The axe-head is incomplete, missing the mouth on one face, with the face missing a portion. The axe is comparatively small with an overall length of 59.50mm and a weight of 62.4g. The incomplete mouth would have been sub-rectangular (36.32mm x 25.3mm). The remnants of the three casting stubs are evident on the three remaining sides of the mouth, demonstrating the axe was produced using four-runner casting technology. The socket has a depth of 39.5mm. The cornice-like mouth moulding or collar has a length of 7.5mm. The slender loop springs from beneath the base of the collar. The sides are straight and diverge slightly before the blade to produce a slightly expanded blade edge. The remnants of the casting flashes are prominent on the sides, and have been finished, probably by hammering. The sides are slightly bevelled towards the centre, producing a slightly hexagonal body profile. The blade edge is poorly preserved and has a width of 38.05mm. Both faces were decorated with three ribs, beginning at the base of the collar and continuing for c. 30mm. The ribs are convergent on the holed face and appear to be parallel on the face with the damaged mouth. The sides of the faces are pronounced suggesting additional ribs. Light sharpening striations are discernible running perpendicular to the blade edge. The surface of the axe is well preserved and has a mid-brown patina. Orange discolouration around the loop is likely to be the result of mineral staining. The damage to the axe is not consistent with its use and does not appear to be the result of casting problems. There is the suggestion that the holed face bows outwards at the base of the hole and that the other face may bend in slightly, perhaps suggesting a sharp implement was forced through both faces.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,62.4,,,,59.5,1,Sian Williams,Sian Williams,Wales,Newport,Newport,Marshfield,ST2583,From a paper map,51.540895,-3.082838,NMGW-E97AE5,,2006110.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2006110.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629386.jpg

155197,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"Incomplete fragment of a cast bronze side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of probable Middle Bronze Age date (1500 - 1150 BC). The fragment represents the lower part of the blade and the upper part of the socket. The point, blade, and lower socket (with associated string-like loops) are missing. Therefore, accurate dimensions of the spears length and width cannot be given. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an irregular cross section. The top of the fragment consists of the upper part of the central rib and is lozenge shaped in cross section; the spearhead expands towards the base of the socket where it is sub-circular in cross section. The base of the socket has been damaged and broken; the internal diameter is approximately 18.7 x 18.2mm. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The fragment measures 54.4mm lengths, has a maximum width of 14.4mm and maximum thickness of 10.3mm. The depth of the socket is 24.1mm. The spearhead weighs 12.86 grams. 

The spearhead is a mid-brown green colour with a relatively complete polished patina that covered all surfaces. This patina has been abraded in several areas and there are a few pock marks from corrosion on the socket. There are also a number of patches of light green powdery corrosion present. As mentioned above the blade of the spearhead is missing. This damage is relatively old as the breaks are worn and abraded. It is suggested that this spearhead fits with similar looped spearheads dated to the Middle Bronze Age, unfortunately the lack of diagnostic features on this examples means that a more detailed and accurate date cannot be achieved.",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,12.86,,,10.3,54.4,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,East Midlands,Leicestershire,Hinckley and Bosworth,Market Bosworth,SK4003,Centred on village (which isn't a parish),52.623297,-1.410546,HESH-29C652,,HESH-29C652.jpg,Bronze Age: Socketed Spear,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-29C652.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/191930.jpg

155792,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast bronze palstave axehead with possible stumped remains of a side loop, dating to the Middle Bronze Age between 1500 - 1150 BC (length: 157mm; width at blade tip: 65.5mm; thickness at flange side: 34.5mm; weight: exceeds the weight limit of 250g).

The palstave axehead is sub-rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in section at the flanges. The septum end (length: 61mm; width: 28.5mm) of the axehead is incomplete with an incomplete butt due to corrosion and a irregular break at the terminal. The septum also has incomplete and corroded flange facets that protrude upwards by approximately 10mm (measured where the flanges are mostly complete) along the outside edge to the left and right and to either side of the artefact. The protruding stop (width of the artefact at the stop: 26mm; thickness: 29.5mm; height of stop to either side: 12mm) is positioned nearly halfway down the palstave.  Below the stop on the blade end of the artefact, there is a slightly dished shield-shaped recess (length of recess: 28.5mm; width: 23.5mm) with raised outer borders on both sides of the axehead, as well as a central protruding ridge running down the centre and beyond this feature (length of central ridge: 54.5mm).  These markings can be described as a ‘trident patterned rib’.  The blade splays outwards towards the curved blade tip (see width above), although none of the original cutting edge remains due to several breaks and areas of bronze disease. The triangular sectioned blade tapers from a thickness of 28.5mm at the stop to 7mm immediately before the blade tip.  Additionally, there is a single and central casting ridge (as a result of the manufacturing process) down the length of either side of the artefact.  Overall, the palstave axehead is in a worn and corroded condition with substantial areas of the original dark brown patina remaining on both sides. There are small areas of bronze disease, which are particularly visible at the butt, side flanges and blade edge of the artefact.

Similar examples with a trident patterned rib are illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums', pages 8 & 13, ref no 46 & 125, which were found in the Wolverhampton area and Co. Antirm, Ballymoney respectively.

Other similar side looped examples with trident patterns are also illustrated in Savory, H, N, 1980, ‘Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections’, pages170-1, ref nos 167 & 176, found at Llysworney, Glamorgan and Tyncochtery, Montgomeryshire respectively.  Savory also details a hoard from Mynydd Tal-y-glannau, Cemmaes, Montgomeryshire, which contains a number of ‘trident patterned’ axes (page 46).

Lastly, a similar example with a ‘trident pattern’ is illustrated in Pearce, S, M, 1983, ‘The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part II’, pages 469 & 610, ref no 372b, found at Eglesham Meadow, Colliton Walk, Dorchester.",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-10-09T23:00:00Z,,,,,,,34.5,157,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,King's Bromley,SK1115,Centred on parish,52.73252803,-1.83853898,WMID-262202,,WMID-262202.JPG,"Bronze Age palstave axehead (front, side and back views)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-262202.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/126258.jpg

The tang has broken near the shoulder, and has a rectangular section. The break is not too recent has it has a different coloured patina to the surface. The tang expands in width towards the shoulder. Integral to each side of the shoulder is the remains of an integral lug. The thickness is of the chisel is at its greatest at this point at 5.38mm and may suggest a collar at the shoulder. The blade is a sub-triangle in plan with the sides being slightly concave and the blade is flared, convex and is abraded. The surface of the chisel has an incomplete dark brown patina, which is pitted, particularly on one surface. The chisel measures 38.98mm long and 18.74mm wide across the blade. It weighs 11.5g. 

Tanged chisels occur from the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1450 BC to 600 BC.), and remain in use until Llyn Fawr Metalwork, 750 - 500BC.

162079,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1300,"Cast copper alloy blade from a palstave, or Middle Bronze Age axe, which would have had built up sides and a stop ridge where the broken end is now, to stop the wooden haft or handle from slipping down the blade. The casting seams still remain on both sides of the blade. The axe seems to have been poorly cast as it looks quite porous at the broken end of the blade, and the stop ridge end has also been hammered in antiquity.

""The axe may be unused having been broken during the late stages of manufacture, or perhaps when someone first tried to use it. When you cast a palstave there is a tendency for the septum to freeze before the much thicker centre section. Hot metal can no longer feed into that area which then suffers a lot of shrinkage; as it is the last area to freeze any dross and other debris ends up in that area too. The analysis gave a high tin bronze (15.7% tin) which is much to be expected either side of the Channel at that time. The blade is as-cast and it is rather more usual to find whole or broken imported palstaves in that state than more locally produced ones. I would guess that it came from the north coasts of the Armorican peninsula to as far east as the Cotentin in France."" (Report by Dr. Peter Northover, Dept. of Materials, Oxford) 

From its style and thickness, it probably dates from the Taunton phase, c.1400-1300 BC.

The socket is cone-shaped in plan and in profile and square in section with a moulded ridge around the base of the socket. The casting seams remain on either side of the socket. The patina is good, but there has been some previous corrosion which has been professionally removed. There is also a faint mark in ink along one of the seams which may be an accession number or site reference, possibly LINC or LNC. The blade is 73 mm long, 22.5 mm wide and 3 mm thick and the socket is 55 mm long, 20.5 mm wide and 3.4 mm thick. This knife comes from a class of socketed knives made during the Late Bronze Age and thought to be used for woodworking, especially hollowing out. There are about ten of these that have been published in the British Isles and the majority come from Scotland. There are also a couple of examples in northern France. &quot;I had to examine these Scottish finds recently and can verify that they are like straight-bladed socketed knives; a bent spearhead from Bai&otilde;es in Portugal is at first glance similar. In this case, the asymmetrical position of the blade suggests it was intended to be bent, since straight blades are symmetrical with the socket&quot; (Brendan O&#39;Connor pers comm). Evans, J. (1881) illustrates similar examples in Ancient Bronze Implements of Britain and Ireland on pages 209-10. Coles, J. (1959-60) illustrates similar examples in Scottish late Bronze Age metalwork: typology, distributions and chronology in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland 93 on pages 46 &amp; 87.

The socket is sub-rectangular, but would have probably been circular at the collar.  The dark patina may have been formed as a result of the burial conditions.

The axe-head appears to belong to Savory’s Late Bronze Age II (c.750-600BC) group of elongated axes with circular, faceted sockets, and bears a great resemblance to nos. 184, 185 and 188 in the National Museum of Wales’ Catalogue of Bronze Age Collections  (fig 24).

The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan from the butt to the stop (length: 70mm) and sub-triangular in profile with the thickest part of the artefact immediately behind the stop ridge.  The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 70mmlong, 18mm wide and approximately 9mm deep.  in plan from the stop to the blade edge (length: 97mm). The flange facets, which are both complete and give the artefact a lozenge-shaped appearance to the side, are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by.  The butt of the axehead is slightly rounded in plan. On both sides of the axe are partially visible linear scars / ribs which extend from the butt to the cutting edge. These have been trimmed and possibly hammered. It is likely that these scars are the remnants of the two part mold used to cast the artefact.  There are a couple of bubbles at the butt of the axe, which also indicate the casting process.  Immediately below the stop ridge is a slight shield-shaped depression, which seems to be relatively common occurance on un-looped palstaves of this period. The blade, which is sub-triangular in plan and mostly sub-rectangular in section, curves and expands outwards towards the complete and slightly bevelled cutting edge.  On one side of the blade, there are numerous scratch or dash marks that occur directly above the bevelled edge.  Overall, the artefact is in a worn but fair condition with a dark green patina.

181160,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-2150,-1500,"Cast bronze (copper alloy) flat axe of Early Bronze Age date, the sub-type of axe is difficult to identify mostly due to the small size of this example. The axe is sub-triangular in plan with a narrow rounded butt that is 9mm wide, the sides expand in evenly to the cutting edge which is 49mm wide, the blade is slightly convex in shape with a prepared cutting edge which has been eroded / abraded in the soil. The blade bevel is slight. When viewed in profile the axe is lentoid (elongated oval).There is no evidence of development such as a median bevel or raised side flanges. The original patina of the axe is mostly lost through corrosion and lamination. The metal revealed is a light green colour with a dusty patina. In places small elements of possible decoration can be seen; this includes small punched depressions on the upper and lower faces - along the edge, and cabling along the long sides. These areas indistinct due to the abrasion. The axe fits with some of the earliest metal artefacts found in Britain, possibly associated with the Migdale Metalworking tradition. This would date it as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

It measures 38.5mm in length and has a cutting edge max. 24.8mm wide. At the socket end (narrowest part) it is 16.8mm wide. It weighs 31.28g.

The axehead is thinnest at the blade end (1.1mm thick) expanding over the length to 12.7mm at the socket end.

The mouth has a slight moulding which is emphasised by a groove beneath it. The loop is cast to the side (and not part of the body of the axe as so many miniature example are) and is C-shaped (8.7x7mm) with a piercing 2.6mm in diameter.

The surface of the miniature axe has lost some of its original patina, although it is mostly smooth and shiny and dark in colour. There is no sign of wear on the loop(suggesting it was not worn as an amulet).

The dating of miniature axeheads is from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period, although they are more common from the Roman period. Their function is probably as an amulet or votive. This axehead is unlike those recorded from Wiltshire so far, which are mostly crude interpretations, whereas this is much more faithful to a true Bronze Age axe. That said however, it is very flat in section and its splayed blade is rather more reminiscent of palstave axeheads than socketed ones. The socket and loop are rather more Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park types.

Robinson comments in WAM 1995 that better-made examples could be used as tools of some sort. He comments on this particular object: ""To my mind this is a classic ""model"" but not miniature axehead. They are always much better made than the miniature axeheads. The example we have in Wiltshire Heritage Museum is 51 mm long which is close enough to yours at 38.5. I had thought that they were Late Bronze Age but could never find strong dating evidence for them"".

The thick moulded collar with a moulded raised parellel ridge below it and multiple ribs, coming off at right angles from the ridge, suggest that this is a Llyn Fawr or Sompting-type axe. The moulding is sub-square in plan, curving at one edge, at the begining of one corner. There are 4 ends of the ribs present, suggesting that the whole face of the axe would have had about 6 to 7 ribs altogether. Late Bronze Age Rohl & Needham (1998) illustrate a similar Llyn Fawr Sompting-type axe with fewer ribs on page 138, Fig.40, No.405, which is dated to c.800-650 BC.

It has a rounded cutting edge and straight sides that taper to the butt which is also rounded. There are two chips in the butt. The centre of the sides are slightly thickened. This is believed to be a precaution to try and prevent the wooden handle splitting when hafted. The main faces of the axe are slightly roughened, with some raised areas. This is probably a result of slight corrosion, though the axe is in generally good condition. The axe has a mid-green patina which is deeper in colour on the cutting edge and the butt. This style of axe, a flat axe, was the first sort of metal axe to be produced, and it’s similarities with stone axes are obvious. Similar examples can be seen in “Guide to the Collection Illustrating the Prehistory of Wales” by W F Grimes (1939).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-09-23T23:00:00Z,,,,240,,,12.7,98.3,1,Amy Downes,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Harrogate,Nun Monkton,SE4959,From finder,54.024679,-1.253538,SWYOR-0F2205,,PAS 337 axe.jpg,Early Bronze Age flat axe,West Yorkshire Archaeology Service,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS 337 axe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/142729.jpg

The axe is near-complete, missing only the loop and has a length of 86.9mm and has a weight of 146.2g. The mouth is comparatively square with an external width (between sides) of 37.0mm (27.9mm internal) and breadth (between faces) of 34.1mm (25.8mm internal). The socket has a depth of 72.4mm with no evidence of internal ribs. The mouth is uneven and appears to have had a prominent rounded mouth moulding. The axe has a weaker moulding beneath the mouth. The loop springs from the top of the lower moulding, and had a length of 22.2mm. The sides of the axe are straight and parallel, until they approach the blade, where they diverge to produce a moderately expanded blade edge. The blade edge is moderately curved with a slightly eroded width of 36.0mm. The unlooped side has a slight angle across its thickness and the casting seam is just about evident. There is no discernible decoration on the faces. The axe currently has much of the surface surviving with a mid brown patina. The surface however is deteriorating and is powdery to the touch with areas of active bronze corrosion beneath.","South Eastern type axes are often associated with the Carp's Tongue complex of North West France (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 217), which heavily influences hoard composition in Lowland England.

187893,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed axe, dating to the Late Bronze Age, between 1150 – 800 BC (length: 87.5mm; width at blade: 45.5mm; width at socket: 36.5mm; thickness: 39.5mm; weight: 166.57g).  This artefact could be further classified as dating from the Ewart Park phase, between 1000 – 800 BC.

The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a hollow triangular section.  At one end of the artefact, the open socket is square with a moulded and lipped edge protruding outwards from all four sides.  The inside of the socket is completely empty.  To either side and immediately below the lipped top of the axe, there are three vertical ribs protruding upwards on each face, with four alternating recessed indentations.  Each rib is approximately 33.5mm in length and 3.5mm in width.  Additionally, each rib tapers inwards slightly as they continue down the artefact’s length whilst becoming less prominent and worn as they seem to blend in with the axe’s expanding blade.  To one side of the artefact, there is a single and integrally cast copper alloy loop (length of loop: 24mm; width of loop: 11mm; thickness of loop: 9mm; length of oval loop hole: 8.5mm; width of loop hole: 5.5mm).  The blade tip curves outwards along the outside edge to either side of the artefact with the blade’s cutting edge still intact.  Additionally, a prominent casting seam is visible down the length of the axe’s sides, running from the lipped open socket to the blade tip.  Although this artefact does appear to have been possibly coated in a substance, the axe is in a slightly worn but good condition with a very dark brown patina.  Some areas of the artefact (near the blade) have small patches where the original patina has corroded and there is a probable scrap/ scratch on the artefact’s side.

The artefact is sub-triangular in plan and is mostly flat in section. The butt and shoulders of the dirk are incomplete with the top completely missing. One rivet holes is partially visible to one side, although two rivets would have been originally visible to the left and right when the artefact was complete. The sides of the blade below the shoulders curve/ taper inwards to start form the blade, where the slightly bevelled edges are still visible on both sides of the artefact. The dirk breaks prematurely at the opposing end, although the artefact would not have continued in length for much longer when complete. Overall, the dirk is in a worn, corroded and pitted condition with a patchy dark green patina. There are numerous pits on the patina all over the artefact and much of the corrosion is present at the blade edges and broken tip.

The external diameter of the mouth (from side to side) is 40.19mm & the internal diamter is 28.83mm, the external diameter of the mouth (front to back) is 41.72mm & the internal diameter 30.04mm.  The length of the side loop is 24.42mm and it is 10.10mm thick.  The axe weighs 275.21g.

Axe 3: The description is exactly the same as above.

The axe measures 109.16mm in length, the blade is 44.93mm wide.  The external diameter of the mouth (from side to side) is 39.70mm & the internal diamter is 28.89mm, the external diameter of the mouth (front to back) is 42.36mm & the internal diameter 30.47mm.  The length of the side loop is 24.77 and it is 10.15mm thick.  The axe weighs 289.67g.

The 2-Part Axe Casting Mould: The mould completely matches the form, size & shape of the above 3 axes and it is therefore fair to say that this mould was used for the casting of these items.

The mould has a 'tongue & groove' design around the main axe impression allowing the two pieces to be closely slotted together during casting.  There is a slight negative surface flaw evident on the internal face of one of the moulds (along the lower blade portion) but this is not seen on the 3 axes and was presumably filed or polished during post-casting axe preparation.  The remains of a failed casting can be seen in the upper portion of one half of the  mould and this is now a pale white-yellow in colour.  The exterior of one half of the mould is decorated with two long irregular linear ridges and one shorter ridge between.  Below this shorter central ridge is a small raised rounded pellet and below this a small depression.  The other half of the mould purely has a smaller central rounded pellet for decoration.  Projecting from the lower perimeter edge of one half is a slight semi-circular flange.

The mould and axes have a rich mid brown patina with some superficial surface pitting/porosity and slight surface scratches probably acquired in recent years.

The Mould with remnant casting measures 151.04mm long and is 63.92mm at its widest point.  It was not possible to weight the item (in excess of 300g)

The second mould piece measures 152.60mm in length and 64.76mm at its widest point.  It was not possible to weight the item (in excess of 300g)


Bronze Metalwork Casting Debris:  There are 6 pieces of copper-alloy casting debris that were found in close association with the hoard.  The debris has bright green corrosion but is brown-orange in colour overall.  It is dense and heavy in relation to its size and has the typical 'bubbled' appearance of casting waste.  The waste measures: 118g, 225g, 86g, 133g, 266g & 255g.

Two additional pieces of copper-alloy metalwork were also presented with the hoard but due to their form and correlation have been deemed Medieval to Post-Medieval in date with the larger of the two being a probably leg for a Medieval cooking pot c.1500s whilst the smaller item is unidentifiable in its current condition.","This hoard was reported in retrospect as discovered during the later 1980s and is therefore not subject to the Treasure Act of 1996 under which such a hoard would now be classified as Treasure.

This Hoard was recorded at the request of Oxfordshire Museums Service after it was seen for sale (with local provenance) at an Oxon Antiques Shop near Chipping Norton.

195454,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"Casting  fragment from a potential bronze side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of Middle Bronze Age date (1500 - 1150 BC). The fragment is irregular in plan but is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a C shaped cross section forming a hollow socket and cast side loops. The fragment narrows along its length and its cross-section changes from a shallow C section at the base to an angular U shaped section at the opposite end. The fragment is likely to be waste from a miscast with only one part of the mould being filled with bronze. The casting fragment measures 37.5mm length, has a maximum width of 13.4mm and maximum thickness of 6.4mm. It weighs 4.97 grams. 

The blade (sides and tip), and base of the spearhead is lost and the fragment has been rolled in the ploughsoil making the edges irregular. All that survives of the spear is the central part of the socket, from the base of the blade to just below the two string-like loops. One of these loops is broken; the other is 9.8mm long, 2.7mm wide and project 2.8mm. The internal dimension is 4.5 x 2.2mm. The cross section of both the loops is sub-oval. The style of this type of loop is known as ‘string’ due to the small size and nature. These two loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead

The spearhead is a mid green colour with an even (but slightly flaky) patina. The patina has been abraded in several areas and there are several areas with an unstable surface. Some of these unstable surfaces have been caused by corrosion, which has caused the metal to laminate slightly. The inner socket of the spear is a mid green black colour and has a similar flaky patina. Similar coloured patinas can be seen on Late Bronze Age axes of the South Wales type specifically around the mouths and around the decorative ribs. It is unlikely that this affect has been caused by the burial environment as the outer surface would have a similar patina. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket. 

Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham’s Period 5 (c. 1500 – 1150 BC).

The rounded cutting edge (37mm wide) shows signs of having been slightly flared, though one side is partly missing. The body of the axe has a bevel, approximately 55mm from the cutting edge, but this is not very pronounced. The axe tapers back to a thin, semi-circular butt (19mm wide). The axe is heavily corroded with no sign of decoration.



Note - Peter Reavill - 18/5/21.



Thanks are extended to Dr Brendan O'Connor who has suggested that this axe form is now better understood after the recent publication of Stuart Needham 2017: The Classification of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age Copper and Bronze Axe-head from Souther Britain.



O'Connor notes: This axe previously suggested as a possible Type Migdale is highly unlikely and although extensive corrosion makes it difficult to be certain where in Needham's Class 4 to place it I believe that it should probably be later rather than earlier c. 2000-1800 BC",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-05-31T23:00:00Z,,,,111,,,9,100,1,Jeff Spencer,Rod Trevaskus,North West,Cheshire West and Chester,Cheshire West and Chester,Dodleston,SJ3660,From finder,53.133298,-2.95804,CPAT-5F0B55,,2487-0005.jpg,Bronze Age Flat Axehead,Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/jspencer/2487-0005.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/153804.jpg

There is evidence of a bevel and sharpening at the butt end but most of the edge is eroded. The butt has two clear rivet holes both damaged and incomplete but with sufficient to indicate a rivet diameter of 5mm. The tip and butt are both damaged and while much of the original surface survives with a dark brown patina, patches have been lost to corrosion. The dagger is similar in form to a dirk or rapier but its length (127mm) defines it as a dagger. It has similarities to daggers of the 'Camerton-Snowshill' tradition.","

The axehead is 102.23 mm long, with a rounded butt and a body which expands in width towards the blade.  There is no butt stop or transverse bevel visible on the body of the axehead, although the original surface has been removed by corrosion.  The axehead has gentle flanges at the edges of the body, which are concave in profile and are cast or hammered.  In section, one flange is noticeably narrower than the other (the width being a maximum of 10.02mm compared to 11.97mm). It is unclear if this is a consequence of wear or corrosion, or whether this difference was generated in the manufacture of the axehead. The blade is heavily splayed and has a curved cutting edge with a maximum width of 42.41mm.  One end of the blade is worn or corroded away.  The axehead weighs 153.12 grams.  The heavily pitted surface of the axehead has a dark brown patina, and light green corrosion products are also visible on the surface. There is a small amount of recent damage on the more pronounced flanges. No decoration is visible on the axehead.

Cast copper alloy shield-pattern palstave with broken blade and butt ends and a damaged left flange. There is a raised edge, in the form of a shield, from the stop ridge below onto the top of the blade. The right side of the palstave, from the butt end to the blade end, retains the raised casting seam, but the left side is more corroded and has been marked with an incision, parallel to the remains of the casting seam, running the length of the side of the flange. The shiny surface within this etched line suggests that it is more recent damage that the palstave has sustained. The casting seams are off-centre, like the other palstave found nearby, but the shield shape is longer and more pointed, suggesting that the palstaves were made in different moulds. The surface of the palstave is quite pitted and has many raised circular lumps, which suggests that it has been in a suitably wet or corrosive environment to develop such areas of bronze disease.

The axe-head is complete, with an overall length of 105.4mm and a weight of 344.0g. The mouth of the axe is sub-rectangular, with internal dimensions of 31.1mm (depth) by 25.9mm (width). The sub-triangular socket has a depth of 75.4mm. No casting stubs are evident on the mouth but there are broken areas above each face, where the casting stubs may have been removed. Below the mouth (6.2mm beneath) is a prominent and well-defined mouth-moulding giving the axe a maximum depth of 43.5mm and width of 39.0mm. Beneath the moulding is a plain concave collar ending in a poorly-defined moulding, which appears as a slight step on the looped side. The loop begins immediately above the lower moulding and is of D-shaped section (5.6mm thick) with a width of 10.6mm, a length of 29.0mm and has a height of 11.6mm. The casting seams are clearly visible and have been neatly finished, but appear less well-finished above the loop. The sides are straight before they expand rapidly at the blade to produce a crescentric blade edge with a width of 52.3mm. Little of the original blade edge survives but the blade does not appear to be much worn. The axe has a rectangular body section, where the sides are slightly convex across their width. Both faces of the axe are decorated with three parallel ribs beginning at the lower moulding and continuing for 45mm. The face sides are also slightly enhanced to suggested further ribs. Rows of hammer marks are evident on the blade and sharpening striations are discernible running along the blade. The axe has good surface preservation with a mid-green patina. One face has a recent mark running as far as the blade which cuts the patina and was likely to have been caused during excavation. There is a black deposit surviving over large areas of the axe surface, confirmed by XRD analysis conducted by Mary Davis to be tenorite calcite, which is unlikely to be a natural corrosion product and was seemingly applied as a deliberate coating to the axe surface.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,344,,,,105.4,1,Mark Lodwick,Sian Williams,South East,Hampshire,Test Valley,Nether Wallop,SU2737,,51.131644,-1.615515,NMGW-C51803,,20078.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20078.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629402.jpg

The axe-head is near-complete and has an overall length of 126.9mm and has a weight of 422.0g. The relatively broad butt appears slightly damaged and is convex with rounded shoulders and has a width of 34.2mm. The sides are straight across the thickness of the axe, giving the axe a rectangular body section. Across its length, the sides are concave and slightly curved. The blade is damaged and the blade tip to blade edge only survives on one side, and suggests a moderately-expanded blade edge. There is the suggestion of a poorly-preserved blade facet, beginning 4mm from the current blade edge. The axe has a maximum thickness of 14.2mm at a point 75mm from the butt. The axe has poor surface preservation and is heavily pitted with a mid-green patina. Where the surface is damaged the axe surface has a pale green colour and has areas of purple, where the damage is deepest. Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefacts was carried out using aCamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The objects were examined whole within the specimen chamber and were analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. All the results presented are semi-quantitative. The results demonstrated that the axe is pure copper, with no other elements detected. The axe has relatively advanced features within the copper axe sequence; the relatively broad butt and the axe being thicker nearer the blade, suggests affinities to Type Dunnottar (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 31), which are some of the earliest tin-bronze axes.

The palstave belongs to the Acton Park metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. The palstave is complete and is comparatively short with a length of only 119.3mm and a weight of 301.2g. The butt is slightly concave and has a width of 22.8mm. The sides are straight and parallel as far as the stop, with a width at the stop of 28.5mm. The flanges begin from the septum and below the butt. The flanges are rounded across their length and reach a maximum height of 28.4mm before the stop (46mm from the butt). The sides are slightly concave across their height, turning inwards at the flange tops. The septum is straight and has a thickness of 9.3mm. The interior of the flanges and the stop are right angled to the septum. The axe has a thickness of 24.7mm at the stop and the stops have a depth of 8.8mm above the septum. While the flanged area of the axe is of normal length, the blade portion of the axe is unusually short with a length of 51mm. The sides of the blade diverge gently, before out-turning sharply at the blade tips and producing a curved blade edge with a width of 48.7mm. The original blade edge has been lost. The flanges continue along the blade face, forming short ribs (15mm long). The blade face has a central, poorly-defined rib, which is less deep than the height of the stop. Either side of the central rib are rounded depressions against the stop. The central rib forms a central bevel on the face and produces a convex profile across the width of the blade face. There is no discernible blade facet. The axe has poor surface survival and is pitted. Small areas of the original surface survive with a dark green patina, notably at the blade and over the septum. At the blade, sharpening striations are evident running perpendicular to the blade. The axe has recently been coated in an oily substance. It is now unclear whether the short blade is the result of deliberate manufacture, possibly for a specialised function or less likely, is the result of prolonged use and wear.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,301.2,,,24.7,119.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Sian Williams,,,,Llanharan,,,,,NMGW-D73AD4,,2007211.jpg,Bronze Age palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2007211.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629544.jpg

The axehead is complete but has eroded considerably, and has an overall length of 122.7mm and a weight of 289.4g. The butt is straight and has a width of 23.0mm. The flanges begin from the septum, 11mm from the butt. The flanges are irregular, probably because of erosion, but are oval to lozenge in shape and appear higher on one face than the other. On one face, the flanges have a height of only 2.7mm and would suggest a developed flat axe; while the other face has flanges 6.4mm high indicating cast flanges. The flanges have a maximum depth of 20.4mm and are convex across the thickness of the axe. The sides are parallel and straight or slightly concave for the majority of the septum and begin to diverge at the position of the median bevel. There is no stopridge on the septum, but the septum gradually becomes thicker to a maximum of 12.7mm at 60mm from the butt at a barely discernible median bevel. The sides of the blade are divergent and produce a maximum surviving width at the blade edge of 48.7mm. It is now uncertain whether the irregular blade shape is because of wear or erosion. Both blade tips and the blade edge have been lost, but one side has the suggestion of a recurved blade. A blade facet is discernible on one of the faces, beginning a maximum of 13mm from the current blade edge. The surface of the axe appears poorly preserved with a pale to dark green colour and has recently been coated in a lacquer or vanish. The high flanges on one side indicate the axe to be cast-flanged, the absence of a stopridge suggest the axe is early in the development of this form and suggest Type Balbirnie as an earliest or transitional type of cast-flanged axe.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,289.4,,,12.7,122.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Sian Williams,Wales,Bridgend,Bridgend,Newcastle Higher,SS8883,From a paper map,51.53475898,-3.61615949,NMGW-E927F3,,200734.jpg,Bronze Age flanged axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200734.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629545.jpg

The axe is broken and has lost the butt in antiquity, with a current surviving length of 67.8mm and weighs 195.1g. The axe has a width of 47.7mm and a thickness of 9.6mm at the break and is of sub rectangular section.

202726,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"A copper alloy low flanged (broad blade) palstave dating from the Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150).  The transverse butt is slightly uneven and incomplete.  The septum is flat on both sides of the palstave. Flanges surround the septum, except at the butt.  These flanges increase in height towards the blade, with the zenith at the curved stop.  The protruding stop is positioned over a third of the way down the palstave.  There is a loop between the stop and the blade on one of the sides of the palstave.  There is some visible evidence of casting flashes running down the centre of both sides, but this is rather indistinct.  Below the stop the blade flares outwards towards the curved blade tips which are splayed. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge.  Below the butt, and running approximately half way down the blade, is a decoration formed by a raised “V” with a raised sub-triangular design nested within. This points towards the blade.

The palstave has a dark brown patina. It is in very good condition other than a number of pitted areas of the surface, an incision on one side of the blade, and some damage to the cutting edge, blade tip, and butt.  The maximum dimensions of the Palstave are 138.5mm long, 66.6 mm wide at the blade, and 34.9mm wide across the butt. It is above the maximum weight of the scales used.

Building on work by Smith (1959), Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p128) identify a group of palstaves as Early Palstaves Group III: Low Flanged (Broad Blade) Palstaves.  These always have a broad blade, splaying to a fan shape, and wide at the edge.  The palstave described in this record appears to fit most closely within this category.  Furthermore, within Group III, this palstave appears to most closely fit into the Type Carleton.  These are looped low flanged palstaves with an expanded edge and protruding blade tips.  The decoration is usually a version of the trident pattern, either an all ribbed trident or a long rib bisecting a shield.  A similar example to the palstave described in this record is catalogue reference 829, in Schmidt and Burgess (1981, plate 60), although this has a more distinct midrib than the example described in this record.

Schmidt and Burgess (1981) argue that the Low Flanged (Broad Blade) palstaves were a logical development from the shield pattern and early midribbed palstaves which preceeded them. They also suggest that, based on evidence of hoards, the type were superseded by Smith’s (1959) transitional form.

The axe head is complete, with an overall length of 22.1mm and a weight of 4.4g. The butt is sub-rectangular and convex (8.2mm x 4.9mm), at the centre is a small oval depression (3.9mm long, 1.9mm wide, 0.9mm deep) representing the socket of a socketed axe, similar to Late Bronze Age forms. The unlooped side is slightly concave and is rounded across its thickness. The loped side is more concave. The loop begins 4.6mm from the butt and end 9.4mm from the butt. The loop has a circular internal perforation with a diameter of 2.0mm. The loop is of D-shaped section with a thickness of 1.8mm and a width of 3.2mm. It was possible that the axe was suspended from the loop as a pendant or similar. The blade edge is straight with rounded blade tips. The axe has a wedge-shaped profile and both faces are plain. The surface is well preserved with pale to dark green patina.","Metallurgical analysis was attempted using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). This object has a fine, even patination, and it was not possible to analyse the underlying metal. The results show a leaded bronze, which would be consistent with LBA compositions, but a Roman date could not be rules out by the analysis. Miniature axes have a largely south west England distribution with a concentration in Wiltshire; Robinson catalogues 36 examples from the county (ibid). The axes are problematic to date because of a lack of reliable contextual information. The creation of a cast socket would seem to suggest a Late Bronze Age date and miniature axes have been found near midden sites such as Whitchurch in Warwickshire (Waddington pers comm.) and from Potterne in Wiltshire. Robinson (1988, p 61) speculates that Late Bronze Age axes may have been venerated and copied as amulates into the Roman period.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,1988-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,4.4,,,,22.1,1,Mark Lodwick,Sian Williams,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Bishopstone,SU2381,From a paper map,51.527448,-1.669852,NMGW-48B6E7,,2007.75.JPG,Copper Alloy Axe,,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.75.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/161077.jpg

206933,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a socketed spearhead, probably from the middle bronze age (1500BC to 1150BC).



The fragment has lozenge-section midrib which tapers towards the tip, which is missing. The fragment is also broken across the socket, with a maximum remaining socket depth of approximately 7.5mm. In section the thin wings are triangular rather than being entirely flat. The wings terminate towards the base of the fragment, approximately where the socket ends. In plan the wings are broadly leaf shaped, although it must be emphasised that they are incomplete and the cutting edges are missing.



The maximum dimensions of the fragment are 69.6mm long, 20.0mm wide, and 12.7mm thick. It weighs 27.06g.



The fragment has a well developed brown patina, and where this is missing, particularly on the edges of the fragment, the surface has a more dull green/brown appearance.



Ehrenberg (1977, p4) states that bronze spearheads first seem to occur in Britain in the final phase of the Early Bronze Age, when three forms were current: the tanged spearhead; the pegged early socketed spearhead; and the end-looped spearhead. The fragment recorded here is unlikely to fit into one of these categories. The tanged spearhead is not socketed unlike the fragment recorded here. The pegged early socketed and end-looped spearheads have a socket divided from the blade by the curving or V-shaped line of the base of the blade moulding (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p4). The most common and widespread form of spearhead from the late bronze age is the plain pegged spearhead (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p13-15). In most cases the socket has a circular external as well as internal section, unlike the example recorded here. The barbed spearhead, also of the late BA tends to have a narrow ovate midrib, again, unlike the fragment recorded here (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p15). Rather, this fragment is most likely to represent one of the main types of spearhead current in the middle bronze age - kite bladed, side-looped, or basal looped (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p6-12). These types may have lozenge midrib sections, as in the fragment recorded here, with the socket extending beyond the blade. However, as the majority of the object is missing, which would have the diagnostic features, the identification and dating cannot be narrowed down further.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-07-31T23:00:00Z,2007-07-31T23:00:00Z,,,27.06,,,12.7,69.6,1,Duncan Slarke,Duncan Slarke,West Midlands,Staffordshire,South Staffordshire,"Lapley, Stretton and Wheaton Aston",SJ8713,From a paper map,52.714499,-2.193876,WMID-50CAF3,,Lyon BA spear 2 jan 08 copy.jpg,"Bronze Age spear (front, profile, reverse)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/Lyon BA spear 2 jan 08 copy.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/162737.jpg
206934,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete bronze age copper alloy tanged knife. The external edges of the tang are incomplete. There is a circular rivet hole in the tang, approximately 4mm in diameter, which is also incomplete. There are striations across one side of the tang, transverse to the orientation of the blade. In profile, the tang expands in thickness towards the blade. There are curved incisions at the edges of the knife, between the tang and the blade, visible when the object is viewed in plan. A midrib runs down both sides of the blade, flanked by shallow and uneven voids. The blade is broadly lozenge shaped in section, becoming more lentoid towards the broken tip. The blade surface is rather uneven with depressions, particularly at either side of the midrib, which are probably hammer marks. There are also narrow shallow striations. The cutting edges and the blade tip are missing. The maximum dimensions of the knife are 53.2mm long, 18.9mm wide and 3.4mm thick (just above the break on the blade). The knife weighs 11.72g. It has light to dark green patina. The knife is similar to one illustrated in ""Bronze Age Metalwork in Salisbury Museum"" (Moore and Rowlands, 1972, accession number 169/1946, plate XVI, no 88 and p.66) possibly from the Wyle Valley. This object has not been dated. A knife from the Reach Fen Hoard, Cambridgeshire is also similar (Ashmolean Museum accession number 1927.2466, see Smith (ed.) 1956, card GB. 17 3 (3), object 43). The Reach Fen Hoard has been dated to the 8th century BC (within the Late Bronze Age) (see Smith (ed.) 1956, card GB. 17 3 (1)) A number of broadly similar knives have been recorded under the Portable Antiquities Scheme (e.g. see NCL-F3D0E3, BH-C79921, LVPL656, BH-9EC2B8).

A Middle Bronze Age base-metal group from Ottery St Mary, Devon Treasure case: 2006 T36. Three objects of prehistoric bronze metalwork were found dispersed over a small area measuring approximately 15 x 10m. In addition, a further artefact was discovered in an adjoining field and was reported as part of this potential treasure case.


1. Looped palstave, fragment. Complete blade with part of loop. The blade expands progressively towards the convex cutting edge. Defined edge bevels on both faces, 11-12.2mm from current cutting edge. Broad central single rib on either face. The loop is incomplete, areas of the flange are missing close to the junction with the blade and the end of the butt is damaged. The blade edge is corrosion damaged and there is a small, semi-circular piece missing from the centre of the blade edge. The lower blade is slightly pocked and has patches of pale green corrosion. Mid-green, dull patina. L: 90.6mm; W. blade edge: 58.7mm; Wt: 263.9g.


2. Looped palstave, fragment. Butt end, joins with no.1, above. Trace of looped handle. Casting flashes removed. Dull dark grown patina with patches of iron corrosion and a white concretion inside the flange on one side. Incomplete at butt end and corrosion-reduced flange crests. L: 63.65mm; W: 24.95mm; L. septum: 56.8mm; D. flanges: 35.95mm; Wt: 94.3g. Flange sides are short and would originally have been petal-shaped with a flat edge level with the butt.


3. Casting jet, copper-alloy. In plan, at the top it is sub-lenticular with one pointed end and the other slightly distorted and with a rounded extension. Casting seams on two sides. There is an oblong 'scar' left from the runner (18.4mm long and 6.35mm wide). Upper surface has a constriction on surface and a slight concavity with a copper-alloy concretion at the centre. Dull, dark almost black patina, with small patches of green, copper alloy corrosion. L: 41mm; W: 27.5mm; Th: 22.48mm; Wt: 83.4g. Dimensions (millimetres/grams) L: length W: width B: breadth Th: thickness D: diameter Wt: weight


Discussion The palstave, represented by the joining fragments (nos. 1-2) is of a standard type for the Middle Bronze Age and specifically the Taunton phase, circa 1400 - 1275 BC which is widely distributed from sites in the South-West . No. 3 is of particular interest since casting jets dating to the Middle Bronze Age are unusual finds.


Conclusion The Middle Bronze Age scatter of bronze/copper metalwork represented by the palstave and casting was found over an area of approximately 15 x 10m. A single original deposit or hoard dispersed through the actions of the plough seems very likely. This material is eligible as Treasure under the new Treasure Order (2002) being a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects. This hoard constitutes an important addition to our knowledge of the Middle Bronze Age period in the south-west of Britain. Additional find, also reported: Tanged knife, fragment. Flat, thin-walled blade with corrosion damage on all edges. At base of the handle there are two short, linear mouldings projecting from either side. Part of edge bevel is evident on one side. L: 87.28mm; W: 6.2-17.9mm; Th: 2.35-3.3mm; Wt: 14.3g. The tanged knife fragment is datable to the Late Bronze Age and specifically the Ewart Park phase, 1000-800 BC. As such, and as the tanged knife fragment (no.4) was found approximately 50m from the group represented by nos. 1-3, it can not be considered as part of the group of Middle Bronze Age artefacts (nos. 1-3).

208993,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Copper alloy awl of uncertain date, possibly Late Bronze Age The awl is of tanged form and is complete with a distorted tang. The awl has a weight of 17.0g and has a distorted length of 77.6mm, originally having been approximately 98mm long. The tang had an undistorted length of 62mm and is of rectangular section (8.7mm x 5.8mm at the base of the tang) and gradually tapers to a point. There is no collar or moulding between the tang and the point. The point of the awl has a length of 36.2mm and is of circular section (11.1mm diameter at the apex), gradually thinning to the point. The awl has generally poor surface preservation with a pale to mid-green patina. The awl is difficult to date on form, the patina may suggest some age to the tool although the form is difficult to closely parallel with later Bronze Age types which tend to be slighter and have square sectioned points. Iron Age and later awls are generally made in iron.



Late Bronze Age types with inset tangs are known from across Britain (WAW-90E4D6; DOR-A9EBD3; SUR-14DC71) and it is likely this object falls within that technological phase.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,17,,,,77.6,1,Mark Lodwick,Sian Williams,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,,,,,NMGW-9CB1D2,,2007.112.2.JPG,Copper Alloy Awl,,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/sianw/2007.112.2.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/164696.jpg

209600,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-700,"Late Bronze Age copper alloy tanged and collared chisel, c.1150-700 BC.



The chisel is likely to have a broken tang and has a surviving length of 53.2mm and weighs 36.6g. The tang has a surviving length of 15.6mm and is of rectangular section, which diverges towards the prominent collar (12 x 9mm at the collar). At the collar the chisel has a width of 19.9mm and a thickness of 12.2mm. The chisel blade thins and narrows below the collar, to a minimum width of 16.4mm. The sides of the blade are concave to produce an expanded blade edge with a surviving width of 35.0mm. The chisel has a pale green to brown patina with some surface survival and has active bronze corrosion. Deep surface striations on one face appear to be beneath the patina and may have occurred in antiquity.","Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65).

The chisel is fragmentary and eroded, represented by the blade and the remnants of the tang, with a surviving length of 37.2mm and weighs 7.5g. The tang has a surviving length of 15mm and is eroded, but is likely to originally have been of rectangular section with straight sides. The chisel has a maximum thickness at the top of the blade of 5.3mm. No lugs or collar are discernible between the blade and tang. The blade has straight sides diverging towards the blade edge, areas of surviving surface on the sides of the tang and blade demonstrate that the blade diverges sharply from the tang. The blade has a surviving width of 19.3mm with a curved blade edge. The chisel has patches of original surface surviving with a mid-brown patina; elsewhere the chisel has a pale green surface.","Tanged chisels have been found associated with palstaves (eg. at Priory Farm Cave, Pembrokeshire and at Doncaster, Yorkshire ) dating to the end of the Middle Bronze Age; these forms tend to have a longer blade with straight sides.

210639,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"An incomplete Early Bronze Age cast copper alloy developed flat axe. The axehead is 107.8 mm long, with a transverse butt, approximately 21mm wide, and a body which gently expands in width towards the blade. There is a broadly straight transverse bevel visible approximately half way down one side of the axehead. The other side has a less complete surface, and no bevel is visible. The axehead has gentle pointed-oval shaped flanges at the edges of the body, which are concave in section, and are cast or hammered. The flanges are slightly thicker than the body of the axe, and are a maximum of 13.7mm thick approximately half way down body of the axehead. In section, the axehead has broadly flat sides which curve up at the edges towards the concave flanges. The blade is splayed, one side more markedly than the other, with a maximum width of 51.5mm. The blade has a curved cutting edge. The axehead weighs 213g. The surface of the axehead has a dark brown patina, but this is incomplete in parts. Where the dark brown patina is incomplete, there is a light green pitted surface. No decoration is visible on the axehead. Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, ""...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembelleshed faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature. Decoration...becomes a commonplace..."" Schmidt and Burgess (ibid.) explain that these developments were in part a function of changing hafting methods - the knee handle, with forked angled end required a narrower shape to fit snugly between the prongs of the fork. Furthermore, dished faces and raised edges made the seating more secure, and the median bevel reduced the tendency of the axe to be driven up into the fork. The axehead described in this record is similar to axe reference 361 identified by Schmidt and Burgess (ibid. plate 31 and p66). This is a developed flat axe of type Bandon. Schmidt and Burgess (ibid, p65) state that: ""Bandon axes are notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm in length. They have straight, parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. The butt tends to be fairly straight often with square corners. Raised edges or dished faces are usually present...A median bevel is usual..."" They add that decoration is characteristic of Irish examples in particular, and they show a trend towards proportionately thicker and shorter forms, having much in common with true flanged axes. The developed flat axe is within Needham's (1996) period 3 (2050-1700BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-06-25T23:00:00Z,,,,213,,,13.7,107.8,1,Duncan Slarke,Duncan Slarke,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Cannock Chase,Norton Canes,SK0304,From a paper map,52.633744,-1.957108,WMID-143A14,,Flat axe copy 31 1 08.jpg,"Bronze Age Developed Flat Axe (front, profile, reverse)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/Flat axe copy 31 1 08.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/166410.jpg

The axe is of uncertain type, probably of faceted type (Type Meldreth (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 204-5) ). The axe is incomplete, missing the mouth and upper body (with a surviving length of 66.1mm and a weight of 77.3g). The body of the axe is slender (with a minimum surviving width at the break of 24.2mm). The sides of the axe are concave and expand at the blade to produce a moderately curved blade. The loop is not present on the incomplete axe. The casting flashes on the sides are not discernible and the axe is well-finished. The sides of the faces have weak, rounded facets producing a sub-octagonal body profile (with a maximum surviving thickness of 12.9mm). The blade edge and the blade tips have been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 42.2mm). Both faces of the axe are plain and slightly convex across their lengths. One of the faces has been crushed against the other, closing the socket. The damage was done by a bladed tool or weapon, as evidenced by a linear scar (6.8mm long) at the base of a V-shaped indentation. The other face has the suggestion of pounding marks at the same level.

212529,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"The two artefacts considered here were found in June 2006 in plough soil by Heritage Writtle about 40 metres from an archaeological excavation, as part of that archaeological investigation. The individual(s) who found the items are not recorded because in the case of potential treasure found in the course of a bona fide archaeological excavation, it is the practice to give only the name of the organisation.


The socketed artefact was found on 16 June and the sword blade fragment on 21 June. The discovery was reported to the Essex Finds Liaison Officer at Colchester Museums, Caroline A. McDonald, on 1 December 2006. The finds are Treasure Number 2006 T606.


Items Discovered 1. The sword blade fragment is a short length of blade weighing 11.52 grammes; the lentoid midrib is demarcated by two grooves. Analysis of the metal indicates that it is bronze. Swords like this are known as Carp's Tongue swords because the shape of the blade tip is said to resemble the tongue of that fish. Few complete Carp's Tongue swords are known in Britain. Most specimens consist of scrap fragments imported in that form from the mainland of Europe (Sealey 19915,7 with refs). They were current in the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age dated c.1020-800 BC (Needham et al. 1998,93,98). 2. Analysis of the metal of the socketed artefact shows it to be brass (an alloy of copper and zinc), not bronze (an alloy of copper and tin). Brass is not found in Britain until the 2nd century BC when it was used to decorate an Iron Age sword blade from the river Thames at Isleworth (Craddock et al. 2004). It remained rare until the Roman period. This object is unidentified and undateable, but it is certainly not Bronze Age and could be well be post-medieval or modern. The Status of the Hoard as Potential Treasure The items in the hoard are of two different dates. The sword blade is late Bronze Age but the socketed artefact is much more recent, and could be modern. It is inconceivable therefore that both items were buried at the same time. Although the Bronze Age sword fragment is ancient, two or more items more than 300 years old are required for the find to qualify as Treasure (as defined in law).

212837,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze dirk of Group IV type, damaged weapon with reworked butt (Burgess & Gerloff, 1981, p 99)  and probably of later Penard or Wilberton metalworking industries, corresponding to Needham’s (1996)  Periods 5-6, possibly dated to c.1200-900BC
The dirk has a damaged butt and is eroded (with a surviving length of 87.7mm and a weight of 22.5g). The butt has been formed by hammering to thin the end (with a minimum thickness of 1.5mm) and to define a sub-triangular facet, with hammer-marks discernible on both faces. The sides of the butt have been hammered from the sides (giving a width of 16.7mm) and therefore the shoulders widen slightly to the blade (with a width of 19.6mm). There is no surviving evidence for any rivet-holes on the butt. The blade is of rounded, low-oval section (with a maximum thickness of 4.0mm before the butt). There is the suggestion of a weak mid-rib, discernible only on one face. The blade sides are convex (giving a maximum surviving width of 19.9mm). Concave blade facets (with a surviving width of 3.7mm) are evident and the blade edges have been lost. The dirk has good surface preservation with a mid to dark-brown patina. There are the remnants of an incised line marking the line of the blade facet and crossing before the tip, in one area there is the suggestion of a double-incised line.","The blade fragment is comparatively substantial, possibly suggesting that the dirk may have been reworked from the tip of a sword with a leaf-shaped blade, or possibly from a heavy rapier.

The date of the awl is uncertain. Awls can date to the Bronze Age. Needham (in Longley, D. & Needham, S 1980 ‘Runnymede Bridge 1976: Excavations on the site of a Late Bronze Age settlement’, Surrey Archaeological Society Volume 6, page 19.) discusses awls and comments they cannot be dated with accuracy within the Bronze Age period as they are found in Early Bronze Age contexts, such as graves as well as Middle and Late Bronze Age hoards. Barber (Barber, M. 2003 Bronze and the Bronze Age: Metalwork and Society in Britain c. 2500 – 800 BC. Tempus) comments that awls are commonly found in graves and their function may not just have been utilitarian. Coombs (Coombs, 2001 in Pryor, F. The Flag Fen Basin: Archaeology and Environment of a Fenland Landscape English Heritage: Swindon p. 287-288) comments that they may represent varying stages of a craftsperson’s apprenticeship or skill. However this awl has not developed the heavy patina associated with Bronze Age awls.

213429,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,42,"Cast copper-alloy unidentified object of a known type usually referred to as 'moustache-like' or 'moustache shaped'. These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material.

The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper part. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the base, which come to a halt about half way along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end. Other hollow examples include: WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. The opening is a maximum of 7.5mm in diameter. Like this object WILT-0C9A63 and NMS-0F4645 also have two rivet holes, one each side of the opening; on this piece they are 1.7mm in diameter. These holes are not seen on complete examples and may suggest repairs or a variation in design.

Due to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete, the opening has a rough surface but that could be due to casting rather than an old break. Based on other known examples (e.g. SF-520513) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original. The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle with a hole through the centre of this bridge. This form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings. The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion. 

This item measures 29.6mm in length, has a maximum width of 11.8mm and a thickness of 11.2mm.

213510,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"Small looped copper alloy palstave with a plain blade, curved cutting edge and pronounced square stop-ridge. This example was found using a metal detector.

The palstave is complete, although it has been eroded around the edges, and the full extent of the cutting edge has worn away.  Patches of the original surface remain, although the majority of this appears to have flaked away, leaving a more rough-textured surface c. 1mm below.  The patina is largely greenish in colour, although the remaining sections of original surface have a more brownish tinge.  The current appearance of the patina differs with the initial photographs of the find taken at the time of discovery, and this is probably connected to the apparent application of a waxy substance to the surface of the palstave.  Where the rough-textured surface has also been lost, around the cutting edge, the loop and the butt, the inner material of the palstave is an orange-brown colour.  It appears that it has been subject to some surface abrasion, in places, revealing the bronze colour beneath.  

The palstave was cast-in-one, as evidenced by a line visible around the sides, showing the junction of the two moulds.  The sides run roughly parallel until the blade begins to flare out roughly two thirds of the way along from the butt, although the stop-ridge causes a slight protrusion on either side (excluding the loop).

Although it is also reminiscent of the Guilsfield type, the palstave appears to belong to the Wilburton phase of metalworking, also known as Needham’s period 6 (1150-950 BC), due to the way in which the flanges run into the septum before the butt.  Savory notes that “At the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, the north Wales industry seems to have specialised in neatly cast, plain-bladed implements with a straight or curving stop-ridge…”. This palstave forms part of this tradition.

Similar (albeit larger) examples were found as part of the Guilsfield hoard (Savory, 1980, fig 32, no 268.2), and also more recently at Pen yr Ole Wen, Gwynedd, in 2005 (GAT PRN 24018;PAS ID GAT-C5BC97)",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2006-11-02T00:00:00Z,,,,221.9,,,26.5,100,1,Nina Steele,Nina Steele,Wales,Conwy,Conwy,Caerhun,SH7773,From a paper map,53.239735,-3.844521,GAT-9006E0,,PRN_24117-002.JPG,Looped Palstave,Gwynedd Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/nsteele/PRN_24117-002.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/169382.jpg

216838,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed spearhead, probably from the middle bronze age (1500BC to 1150BC).



The fragment has lozenge-section midrib which tapers towards the tip, which is missing. The fragment is also broken across the socket, which has a circular internal section, and tapers to a point approximately 35mm from the broken base of the socket. In section the thin wings are triangular rather than being entirely flat. The wings terminate towards the base of the fragment, but the damage to the surface of the spearhead means that it is unclear if this is due to loss of material. In plan the wings are broadly leaf shaped, although it must be emphasised that they are incomplete and the cutting edges are missing.



The maximum dimensions of the fragment are 70.5mm long, 17.8mm wide, and 10.3mm thick. It weighs 21.49g.



The fragment has a well developed green patina, and on the substantial areas where the original surface is missing, particularly on the edges of the fragment, there is has a duller green/light green pitted appearance.



There are distinct shallow grooves running down all of the original surfaces of the spearhead. These are patinated suggesting that these were not made recently. Ehrenberg (1977, p4) states that bronze spearheads first seem to occur in Britain in the final phase of the Early Bronze Age, when three forms were current: the tanged spearhead; the pegged early socketed spearhead; and the end-looped spearhead. The fragment recorded here is unlikely to fit into one of these categories. The tanged spearhead is not socketed unlike the fragment recorded here. The pegged early socketed and end-looped spearheads have a socket divided from the blade by the curving or V-shaped line of the base of the blade moulding (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p4). The most common and widespread form of spearhead from the late bronze age is the plain pegged spearhead (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p13-15). In most cases the socket has a circular external as well as internal section, unlike the example recorded here. The barbed spearhead, also of the late BA tends to have a narrow ovate midrib, again, unlike the fragment recorded here (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p15). Rather, this fragment is most likely to represent one of the main types of spearhead current in the middle bronze age - kite bladed, side-looped, or basal looped (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p6-12). These types may have lozenge midrib sections, as in the fragment recorded here, with the socket extending beyond the blade. However, as the majority of the object is missing, which would have the diagnostic features, the identification and dating cannot be narrowed down further.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,,,21.49,,,10.3,70.5,1,Duncan Slarke,Duncan Slarke,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Huntington,SJ9613,From a paper map,52.714643,-2.06065,WMID-103158,,Palmer BA spear copy2.jpg,"Bronze Age spear (front, profile, reverse)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/Palmer BA spear copy2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/172721.jpg

221126,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"This is an interesting example of an Iron Age Socketed Axehead in copper alloy from cica 750 – 600 BC.  In style, it fits with the characteristics of the Sompting type and the Llyn Fawr Phase.  The axe is wedge shaped in both plan and profile view, with an ovoid socket.  There is a marked single strengthening collar to the mouth of the socket with the attachment loop being just below that collar, on the side seam of the axe. 

There are pronounced moulding seams running from the mouth to the blade tips on each side.  The blade tips are slightly flared.  There is also a slight ‘chamfer', noticeable to each corner from the socket mouth, tapering down toward the blade.

The overall condition of the axe is poor, with considerable loss of the original surface, that which is left has a dull brown patina.  One side of the axe has been damaged and split, presumably in antiquity, that damage reveals how thin the walls of this axe are.  The apparent fragility of this moulding might explain the lightness of this axe at just 175 gms.

Another interesting feature of this axe is the internal moulding, which extends into the flare of the axe head.  That in turn, might suggest the possibility of reducing the metal content to a minimum, in conjunction with the thin walls.  Could this type of manufacture, with its lack of overall mass, indicate a more 'votive' aspect, than a practical tool?",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2008-01-19T00:00:00Z,,,,175,,,37,106,1,Rod Trevaskus,Rod Trevaskus,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Wem Rural,SJ4631,From finder,52.873748,-2.803734,CPAT-79CD04,,2456-0054r.jpg,"Iron Age, Socketed Axe Head, ",Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2456-0054r.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/177654.jpg

The end of the mouth is not flat; there are two crests at about the central point on either face. There is a loop on the haft end of one side of the body. When viewed in profile, the axe can be seen to be broadly triangular in shape, with the front and reverse faces being slightly convex. The mouth of the axe is sub-square with rounded corners, almost circular, although towards the cutting edge the socket and the axe are rectangular in section. The socket extends approximately 62mm into the axe. There is a plug of earth within the socket which can be freely removed. Two ridges run down the upper portion of the socket, at about the centre of the front and reverse of the axe. A casting seam runs down both sides of the axe. There are some slightly raised areas on the surface of the axe with a lustrous smooth brown patina. But generally the axe has a slightly pitted brown surface, with a few small areas where green corrosion products are visible. There are transverse grooves/striations and some crazing visible on the surface of the lower blade, particularly on one face of the axe. There is a slight depression on both faces on the body of the axe. The cutting edge is complete and remains sharp. There is a small amount of recent damage on the collar and edge of one face where the surface has been removed revealing the yellow/gold colour of the metal. The axe is in excellent condition overall. The axe is 98.9mm long. The cutting edge is 39.8mm wide and the mouth is 36.6mm from side to side, and 35.3mmm from front to back (maximum external dimensions). The axe has a mass of 183.8g excluding the plug of soil in the socket. The axe recorded here is similar to south-eastern socketed axes identified by Scmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 212-6, and plate 85), particularly axes 1275-1279 which are Variant Bilton (described as Variant Worthing on Plate 85). Schmidt and Burgess (ibid, p. 212) comment that the south-eastern type of socketed axehead is, ""...characterized by a fairly slender, square to rectangular-sectioned body with a squarish mouth."" They explain that Variant Bilston/Worthing axes have long bodies with concave sides curving to an unexpanded cutting edge, and a mouth where a rounded collar has a single moulding set below it (ibid., p.214). South-eastern axes appear to date from the Ewart Park Phase (Ibid. p.216-7) and, ""...may not have survived much into the Llyfawr period"". (ibid. p.217).

226015,Wedge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An unusual cast copper alloy / bronze wedge or possibly chisel formed from the recycled lower (blade) section of a looped palstave possibly decorated with a central rib. The palstave would date from the middle Bronze Age; however, it is difficult to say when it was made into a wedge. It is likely that this was done during either the later Middle Bronze Age or Late Bronze Age (1500-800 BC). The blade has been broken or deliberately trimmed at the junction point between the blade and the raised flanged stop ridge. It is difficult to ascertain more detail as the broken end has been repeatedly hammered and damaged through use as a 'cold?' chisel. In Plan the wedge is broadly sub-rectangular and is sub-triangular in cross section. The wedge measures 70.6mm length, has a maximum width of 33mm and maximum thickness of 18.1mm. It weighs 149.78 grams.






The blade of wedge extends from a relatively narrow point, just below the break (stop ridge), and expands with regular straight sides to a much worn convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the break. The thickness of the blade tip is 4.1mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 16.6mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 18.1mm). Beneath the break, is slight evidence of a raised tapering central rib. This rib is very slight and only shows in oblique light, it has been much eroded on both faces. The convex cutting edge is asymmetric and heavily worn with almost all the original blade bevel being lost. It seems that the cutting edge has been reset as the shape of the blade is very flat (by this I mean that the angle the two blade facets make is very low meaning that the two edges have been heavily worn and reshaped). The broken end of the wedge has been repeatedly struck with a blunt tool (hammer) which has flattened the metal, distorting the break and spreading the bronze laterally to form flared surface. To one side is a small sub-circular projection, which has been hammered / flattened. This is the remains of a side loop which would have projected from below the stop ridge and extended to a point on the mid -point of the axe. The loop would have aided hafting. The stub measures 7.9mm length, 7.1mm width.






The wedge is a mid green brown colour with an even but abraded patina which covers all surfaces. There is some evidence of erosion caused by movement in the ploughsoil; however, this is limited and minor. There is no evidence of active corrosion on wedge and all surfaces seem stable. A direct parallel for this sort of recycling / re-use have not been found, however, it is likely that this type of recycling is not uncommon. The majority of broken tools would have been recycled for their metal contact and so this may be a rare example of this form of temporary reuse which was at one point common place. The age of the reuse is difficult to ascertain, however it is likely to date from the period the axe was made or shortly thereafter. A broad period of Middle - Late Bronze Age is suggested 1500-800 BC, however it is most like to date from the period (1400-1000BC)",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,,,,,149.78,,,18.1,70.6,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Cockshutt,SJ4330,,52.86444918,-2.84812465,HESH-098032,,HESH-098032_detail6.jpg,Bronze Age: Wedge or possible chisel formed from reused looped palstave,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-098032_detail6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/277737.jpg

What might conceivably be the start of the socket is visible at the lower (broken) end of the midrib. The edges of the blades are blunt, having been completed destroyed by corrosion. The rest of the surface is pitted with many scratches. Length 26.3 millimetres; width 13 millimetres; weight 3.78 grams.











Hoard Weight











63.96 grams (before conservation).











Date











There is nothing chronologically sensitive about the hoard components. Socketed axes appear in the middle Bronze Age Taunton phase (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 172-3), which began c. 1500 BC (Needham et al. 1998, 85). But they are not found in any numbers in Essex until later when find numbers peak in the c. 1020-800 BC Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age. Theoretically the axe might belong to the c. 800-600 BC Llyn Fawr phase but metalwork of that period is almost unheard of in the county (Cuddeford and Sealey 2000, 15; O'Connor 2007, 64). The only Llyn Fawr axe known to the writer from Essex is a solitary bronze Sompting axe from Walthamstow published as a drawing in the frontispiece to Hatley (1933). Technically therefore the High Laver 2 hoard should be assigned to the broad period c. 1500-600 BC, although the likelihood is that it belongs to the c. 1020-800 BC Ewart Park phase.











An Interpretation of the Finds and Their Status as Potential Treasure











The items catalogued here are bronze or copper-alloy (although no scientific metallurgical analyses of the finds have been undertaken) and were found together the same field. Bearing in mind their date and the fact that both items were found together in direct association and therefore constitute a hoard, there is a prima facie case for considering the find to be treasure, as defined in law.

The tool is a square sectioned rod which narrows and slightly thins to a rectangular section at the ends. One end narrows to a diagonal blade, the other is broken (the break is patinated) but is also narrowing to a blade or curved end. 
Many Bronze Age awls have been found in excavations and by detectorists, they tend to have a square section in the middle but normally narrow more sharply than this example and have circular sectioned terminals, or one circular sectioned end to allow them to be turned during use (see, for example, the selection published in Piggott (1964), p.113). It is not clear this example would work as an awl without that circular section but it could be some other woodworking or engraving tool of Bronze Age or later date.

In between the two flanges is a flat groove 'septum' with a stop ridge across the width where the ends of the prongs of the wooden handle would rest to haft the palstave to the handle. The stop ridge prevents the butt of the palstave from splitting the handle. Just below the stop ridge at the top of the blade is a semi-circular ridge with central double ribs forming a 'shield-pattern'. The blade then expands to the curved cutting edge which is bevelled for sharpness. The copper alloy has a rough mid-pale green patina; there is some surface and edge damage.

The gold wire was found attached to the biconical bead, the flattened hook terminal being held inside the interior of the bead. This object is hard to parallel, however its terminals resemble hook and clasp terminals on cuff armlets and ribbon torcs of gold, which date to between 1600-1300BC.

244802,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-800,"A small penannular ring of sheet gold construction, with simple terminals separated by a narrow gap. The sheet strip has been carefully folded over, to give an oval shaped cross-section, the internal edges around the interior diameter being separated by a gap of 1-1.5mm. The ring has been dinted, with a compression crimp in one place causing a small tear.











This ring finds parallel with both penannular gold rings and 'hair-rings' of the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1400-800BC), which are now generally thought to be either hair or ear adornments. Rings of twisted bar or circular rod construction tend to date to the Middle Bronze Age, while 'hair rings' covered with gold foil, electrum wire or plating are most common during the Late Bronze Age. This example may represent the transition between solid gold and foil construction, therefore as a potentially early example of a 'hair-ring', could date to as early as the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC). Semi-quantitative analysis of the ring indicates a very high gold composition, with a small percentage of silver and 1% copper. The ring was found in the lower fill of a ditch at the periphery of a settlement, providing important dating evidence for its occupation during the Later Bronze Age.",,3,Gold,,,Controlled archaeological investigation (stratified),2007-09-30T23:00:00Z,,20070723,,1.41,,14.8,3.7,,1,Mark Lodwick,Adam Gwilt,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Trearddur,SH2580,From finder,53.287994,-4.626791,NMGW-9AC224,,Trearddur 2007 07.23b.JPG,Trearddur 07.23b,The British Museum,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/smcfarlane/Trearddur 2007 07.23b.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/291043.jpg

Description of object



1. Twisted gold penannular gold bracelet fragment. The bracelet is made on a rectangular-sectioned (4.1mm x 3.1mm) bar and has a plain unexpanded terminal. The edges and corners of the terminal are sub-rounded. The bracelet is twisted, giving the body of the bracelet a (concave-sided) lozenge-shaped profile. The bracelet has a comparatively loose twist (of 180 degrees on the fragment) and approximately one-third of the original length is represented. The break would appear to have been cut through a little over half the thickness and bent or twisted through the remainder. The curvature on the bracelet fragment is likely to be similar to the original.



Length - 40.0mm (Approximate straightened length - 58mm); Width- 4mm;Thickness - 3.1mm; Wt. 10.2g



Discussion



The penannular bracelet is of bar-twisted type characteristic dating to c. 1300-1100 BC known in Ireland and Britain. Eogan (1994, p50) classifies the form of bar bracelet as type iii. The bracelet fragment can be closely paralleled with two complete examples found at Saintjohns, Co. Kildare (Eogan, 1994, p 63, fig 27B 2-3, plate XII, Taylor 1980 ref. CoKd 9-10). Twisted gold bracelets and torcs have been found in fields in Wiltshire and throughout southwest England though they have tended to be deposited with accompanying gold objects (Roberts 2007).



Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefact was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The object was examined whole within the specimen chamber. The percentages presented are semi-quantitative only. Analysis suggests that the metal is composed of c. 86% gold and 12% silver. The composition is broadly consistent with Middle Bronze Age gold-working.","Previous Entry

The sides narrow to the butt and the flanges have been hammered higher on one face than the other. The sides are 12.85mm high (body of axe 9.77mm). The (mostly missing) cutting edge seems to expand at the (oldish) break.

The butt (which is 2.58mm in thickness) is slightly damaged.

The surface of the metal is pitted and some of the patina has flaked away. One face has an off-centre hole which does not pierce through to the other side, although there is a slight bulge in the metal there which could represent a shallow stop ridge. The hole is 5.46mm in diameter and 4.27mm deep.

The hole, which appears to have been drilled intentionally in antiquity, may represent ritual destruction of the axehead.

The edges of the blade are uneven all the way around where small pieces have broken off. 

The blade widens from the tip, reaching its widest point at mid-blade. It then begins to narrow to the waist. It widens slighly again to meet the hilt section. The section between the waist and the shoulder has a narrowing of the blade then a sub-trianglular section. This section would have led into the grip but it has broken before it reaches here. There are two circular rivets on this section, one on either side. The sword has broken just after the rivets.

The sword has an unven light green patina with patches of darker green and brown. It has some corrosion in patches on the surface. The hilt in particular has a lot of corrosion on.

The damaged butt end appears to be complete at one corner and broken at the other. Just off centre is a bubble in the metalwork, possibly contributing to the break by weakening the metal.

The break at the other end of the fragment is I-shaped in section, just as the flanges are beginning to develop. The fragment is too small with not enough surviving of the flanges to tie it down further.

255788,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"A 5-coil gold penannular ring, cut at each terminal. Each coil is made individually from a solid gold wire. The wire is circular in section.



In addition to being cut, the ring has been damaged due to bending, with two of the wires separating from the rest and bending at different angles. This damage indicates that the coils were probably heated and then pressed together along their lengths, as there is a slight flattening of the coils along the lengths revealed.

255964,Pestle,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-2100,-700,"Coarse-grained gabbro cobble with heavy use as a pestle around most of the perimeter (Henrietta Quinnell forthcoming). The pestle is round in plan, with two rounded sides, and plano-convex in section. The pestle is flat and smooth on the face that was used for rubbing, and more convex on the opposite face, where it was held and pushed across a base or mortar for grinding. The gabbro is a coarse-grained variety, probably from Cudden Point, Perranuthnoe, about 4 miles across Mounts Bay (Jens Andersen pers comm), containing pale pink felspars and dark grey pyroxene inclusions. The soft felspars would work into hollows and the hard pyroxene, as a silicate mineral, would stand proud of the surface, thus allowing a shearing action to cut and grind the grain. The shape of the pestle suggests that it was made from a beach cobble. Jones (2002) illustrates a similar example excavated from Callestick on page 29, Fig.13, No.95 which is dated to the Later Bronze Age, c.1100-700 BC.

256038,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,POST MEDIEVAL,-1500,-1150,"Cast bronze (copper alloy) side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of Middle Bronze Age date (1500 - 1150 BC). The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade. The hollow socket is near complete with a small area of relatively modern damage at the base. Two single cast ‘string’ side loops  are present, one on either edge. The spearhead measures 102.5mm length, has a maximum width (across base of socket) 15.5mm and maximum thickness of 15.4mm (across same place). The depth of the socket is 75.9mm. The spearhead weighs 30.21 grams. 

The tip of the spearhead is complete however the side blades have been much abraded in the soil, loosing most of their shape and also the cutting edges. However, the overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The surviving width of the blade is 14.8mm. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib, which projects further on one face than the other. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear and is best described as being conical in shape. At the mouth of the socket it has a diameter of 15.5mm and a thickness of 1.5mm. The base of the socket is feathered by abrasion. The central raised line of the mid-rib does not extend into the socket as a decorative feature. Positioned approximately 1/3 of the length of the socket parallel with the blade are two oval shaped string loops. The loop has a maximum length of 10.4mm, width 2.6mm, and thickness of 1mm. The internal diameter of the loop measures 4.2mm x 2mm. The cross section is lentoid. Both loops are filled to some extent with an orange corrosion product, probably an iron pan, due to the burial conditions. These loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams on either edge of the spear have trimmed and hammered flat. 

The spearhead is a mid-brown green colour with an even but much corroded patina. The patina has been abraded in several areas and there are several areas with an unstable surface. Some of these unstable surfaces have been caused by corrosion, which has caused the metal to laminate slightly. There are a number of concreated areas of iron staining, probably due to burial conditions. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket. 

Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham’s Period 5 (c. 1500 – 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,,,,,30.21,,,15.4,102.5,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Wem Rural,,,,,HESH-C348E5,,HESH-C348E5_5.jpg,Middle Bronze Age: Looped and Socketed Spearhead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-C348E5_5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/274840.jpg
