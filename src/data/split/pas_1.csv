63423,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"
Three ribbed South Wales Type socketed axe of cast bronze. One upper face and most of the mouth top has broken away, whilst the loop is broken. This medium sized axe is slender in form, with slightly divergent sides, widening near the blade end to form an expanded blade with slight recurving at the edges. The casting seams down each side of the axe remain prominent, though seem to have been blunted and rounded, possibly through hammering. The axe has a rectangular cross section, though the face edges are slightly curved. Three well-defined longitudinal ribs extend from the underside of a prominent outsplayed mouth moulding, converging slightly towards the blade end. The blade edge has entirely corroded away, although hammer marks and striations on the blade bevel, parallel to the blade edge, indicate that the axe blade was prepared and sharpened for use. The axe has minor casting blemishes upon the inner socket surfaces and on one outer face, though not serious enough to affect it functioning as an axe, whilst the socket base is flat and deep. The mouth, break edges and blade edge are severely corroded, light green and powdery. When reported for identification there were a number of additional corroded small fragments, which had detached themselves from the axe. Most of the axe surfaces are original and have a good dark-brown to black patina.
","
Inside the socket of the axe were found well mineralised plant fragments, possibly grass stems, which were removed for study. These may have been within the socket when it was deposited within the ground.

63682,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1750,"This is a large developed flat axe of bronze dating to the Early Bronze Age. The butt is modestly rounded, though with angular corners. The sides are straight, but slightly divergent for just under three quarters of the length of the axe, curving out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded and deeply crescentic cutting edge. All of the original blade edges have been removed by erosion, thereby preventing accurate calculation of the original width and recurve of the blade edge. Approximately 57mm from the butt end is a straight stop-ridge across the axe. The margins of the septum are defined by shallow flanges, which appear to have been hammered up, rather than being cast. The axe sides are faceted: each has an angled mid-ridge, each facet being covered with hammer marks. These tend to be aligned at a consistent diagonal angle across both facets, with no apparent pattern. Nevertheless, they provide some decorative quality to the axe sides. On one upper septum face, there are feint linear dashes or scratches running longitudinally, possibly decorative rain-drop decoration, now barely visible. On each upper blade margin there is a distinct, shallow, hammered crescentic groove, defining the edge of the blade bevel. Striations are visible on each blade bevel, indicating that the blade was prepared and sharpened. Original surfaces survive over most of the axe and these have dark brown patination. However, original surfaces have been lost on the butt, down one lower side, in patches over one blade bevel and around the blade edge. Here, the bronze has a light green patina.","This axe can be classed as Type Bandon (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or a probable Class 4 (follow Needham 1983; forthcoming), dating to Periods 3-4 of the Early Bronze Age (c.1950-1500 BC) (Needham 1996). Class 4 axes straddle the boundary between Periods 2 and 3, but this axe can be confidently assigned to Period 3, probably falling within the late Aylesford to Willerby metalworking phases (c.1950-1750 BC) (Needham et al. 1997). At the time of writing (Aug 2017) 27 Class 4 axes dating to this period are currently known from across Wales, the vast majority being single finds.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-02-01T00:00:00Z,,,,319.3,,,14.9,132.1,1,Adam Gwilt,,Wales,Wrexham,Wrexham,Overton,SJ4044,From a paper map,52.989957,-2.895274,NMGW-4596D8,,,,,,,

65225,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed gouge, probably of Ewart Park (c. 950 - 750 BC) metalworking tradition. The gouge is of circular mouth section and has a low-raised collar, which is very slightly concave and is 10mm deep from the mouth. The casting seams are prominent on both sides and are likely to have been finished by hammering. The sides are straight and diverge slightly at the blade. Sharpening striations are visible on both of the blade faces. The striations are angled across the blade, towards the sides on the front (gouged) face, and are positioned along the blade circumference on the (circular) back face. Inside the socket at the mouth are two incised or possibly cast lines; one on the rim and the other 2.5mm into the socket. The gouge is in good condition, with only a little damage to the blade edge, and has a dark brown patina.","David Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class IIa category, which is characterised by a deep collar and narrow blade. Classes of gouges are difficult to distinguish chronologically, but can be broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age, particularly the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (c.1150-750 BC), though different forms continue in use into the Early Iron Age. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a similar collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-02-01T00:00:00Z,,,,45.6,,17.5,,75.2,1,Mark Lodwick,,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Cowbridge with Llanblethian,,,,,NMGW-52C2A3,,dscn2255.JPG,Socketed gouge,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/dscn2255.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/23344.jpg
65234,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1350,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age Transitional palstave of Type Shelf, (midribbed variant), dating to the end of the Middle Bronze Age. The palstave is of the Penard metalworking tradition, falling into the later part of Needham's (1996) Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150BC). Characteristically for the type, the palstave is slender with a narrow blade, low-flanges and was looped (now broken). The butt is slightly angled and is irregular, possibly through damage. The septum is concave and the stop is straight with right angles to the flanges. The sides are straight and parallel above the stop and the flanges are rounded, forming an elipse with the blade faces. Uncharacteristically for the type, the flanges reach their apex before the stop; this variation in the flange line may be seen as an influence of later (Irish) or earlier (primary / low-flanged) palstaves. The blade sides are subtly curved and gradually diverge to an unexpanded edge, resulting in weak blade corners. The blade edge is only slightly rounded. The blade faces are convex near the stop and are decorated with a weak midrib or ridge. There is no discernible blade facet. The casting seams are visible on the sides, and have been neatly finished.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-02-01T00:00:00Z,,,,347,,,30.6,139,1,Mark Lodwick,,Eastern,Norfolk,North Norfolk,Briston,TG0831,From a paper map,52.836342,1.086578,NMGW-53F626,,DSCN2271.JPG,Palstace (front),The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DSCN2271.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/23012.jpg
65236,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1000,"
Single-looped, narrow-bladed and slender palstave of cast bronze. Part of the butt-end of the palstave is missing, whilst the loop has broken off in antiquity. This narrow palstave form exhibits waisting below the stop, the upper sides above the stop being very slightly convex. The sides below the stop are slightly concave and curve outwards into a moderately expanding, but narrow cutting edge. The cutting edge is now blunted, but moderately crescentic in plan. A prominent midrib or mid-ridge descends from the stop on each face, whilst the face edges are rounded. This gives the palstave a lozenge shaped cross-section immediately beneath the stop. The flanges of the palstave are heavily eroded near to the stop, therefore obscuring the characteristic side view of this axe form, which appears as an elongated lozenge. In side view, the stop curves outward gradually, rather than as an angular overhang. Most of the original surfaces of the palstave are lost, with local original surface patches above the stop on each side and on one upper face. The palstave is thus heavily eroded, with extensive pitting visible along the lower blade end. The palstave has a dark green to brown patination.
","Transitional palstaves may be dated to the Middle-Late Bronze Age, specifically the Penard-Wilburton metalworking phases (c.1300-1000 BC) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981).

The two side loops (c. 19. x 6 mm) are low and flat with a roughly lozenge-shaped plate. Casting seams are clear on both sides below the loops, and have been neatly finished by filing. The striations from the filing survive around the loops. The base of the spearhead is slightly thinner, with a gentle step 5mm from the base. The casting seams have been removed before the step. The surface of the fragment has survived well with a dark brown patina.","The low, flat nature of the side loops indicate this was probably part of Davis' (2012) Group 6 (developed side-looped spearhead), which dates to the Taunton-Penard phases as defined by Needham et al. (1997). However, similar side loops can be observed on earlier spearheads dating to the preceding Acton Park 2 phase (c.1600-1400 BC), which are defined instead by the blade shape so exact dating is not possible.

The tip survives, and the edges are in remarkably good condition and are still sharp. The blade tapers out to the shaft which is oval, with two circular holes at the top, one of which has been broken in antiquity. The top of the shaft is slightly hexagonal in shape. The dirk has a greeny/brown patina, and the surface which survives, has a light etching to it. Dating to an early date within the middle bronze age, part of the Acton assemblage or possibly the Taunton phase, circa 1600 - 1400/1300 BC.

   The convex cutting edge of the axe fragment, although corroded and slightly abraded by the soil, is worn and shows areas of possible sharpening. The break at the top is old. It has also suffered from corrosion, however, there are a number of large sub-oval and circular holes or pits in the metal. The majority of these may have been formed through corossion, but the largest is probably an air-pocket in the metal formed when the axe was cast. This would have weakened the blade of the axe at this point and probably contributed to it breaking here. It is a dark mid-green brown colour with an even patina.

72277,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1400,"A complete cast Bronze Age palstave axehead (length: 163.5mm; width: at cutting edge: 69mm; thickness at flange facets: 33mm; over 200g).  The butt of the axehead is fairly corroded and pointed to a tip.  The septum measures 18mm wide with flange tops protruding upwards at either side by 11.5mm in height.  The stop is 62.5mm down the length of the septum with a shield-shaped impression on the other side, measuring approximately 29mm in length down the blade, probably as a form of decoration.  At either side of the axehead as the flange tops slope downwards after the stop, there is a nick which protrudes outwards very slightly.  The length of the blade from the end of the shield-shaped pattern to the blade facet measures 65.5mm and it slopes downwards to the start of the possible blade facet which begins approximately 14mm from the edge. The blade splays outwards nearer the edge to form a cresent shape with blade tips on either side.  The cutting edge is heavily corroded which some of the surface patina worn/ corroded away, particularly by bronze disease.  The casting seam is visible on either side of the axe and continues down the overall length of the flange and the blade side.  Overall, the axehead is in a worn and corroded condition in certain areas and has a dark brown-black patina.


This axehead is similar to shield-shaped palstaves of the Acton metalwork, as mentioned in Rohl & Needham's 1998 paper 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis': see reference numbers 92-6.  The Acton metalwork dates from 1500-1400 BC and comes under the Deverel Rimbury and allied groups grave series, showing the major burial tradition in England and Wales at the time.  There similar artefacts in the Birmingham Museum Collection, as illustrated in Philip J Watson's 1993 paper titled 'Catalogue of British & European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums; reference numbers 123 & 5, especially those with the shield-shaped patterning.  No 123 is a palstave with high flanges extending beyond the stop ridge with shield pattern decoration.  It can be classified as Burgess group B/A from County Londonderry, Londonderry.  No 125 is an unlooped palstave with trident pattern, broken butt and has been classified as Burgess group A. and was found at Antrim, Ballymoney.  Other similar examples include those from Chepstow Bridge (Gloucestershire) and Arreton (Isle of Wight), as illustrated in S. M. Pearce's 'Bronze Age Metalwork in southern Britain'; see fig 7c & 8e.


Pearce calls these palstaves 'the backbone of the Middle bronze Age industry' (page 23).  They are a technical improvement on the ealrier flanged axes.  The earliest palstaves lack side loops and have their blades decorated with a midrib (Group 1 type) like that from Chepstow, or with a shield pattern (Group 2 type).  Early midrib and shield pattern palstaves were also being manufactured byt the Acton Park smiths of North Wales and by smiths in eastern Britain before 1400 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,1997-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,,,,33,163.5,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,South Staffordshire,Teddesley Hay,,,,,WMID-A37D33,,WMID-A37D33  2.jpg,"The side view of a cast bronze palstave axe, dating from c.1500-1400 BC.",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-A37D33  2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/33199.jpg
72288,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1275,-1140,"A rare and important find for Essex of an almost complete Bronze Age bronze arrowhead. Cast in one piece, this arrowhead is barbed and tanged in form, with the two sides forming an angle of approximately 35 degrees. It is 39.76mm long, 19.82mm wide from barb to barb, 2.56mm thick and weighs 5.10g. The extreme end of the point is missing and the barbs are damaged and truncated. The tang, which is complete and rectangular in plan is 7.8mm and the barbs are 3.48mm and 2.38mm long respectively. The arrowhead has a low mid ridge, making the object bevelled on one face and so gives it a triangular section. Much of the original surface survives with a dark green patina, but it is heavily scratched and pitted. The exposed surfaces are mid green in colour. There is one small patch of bright green corrosion to one side of the longer tang.


There is only one bronze arrowhead from a secure Bronze Age context in Britain and that was in the Penard hoard, first reported in Archaeologica 71, page 138. The Penard arrowhead has a mid rib as opposed to ridge, but is still barbed and tanged. At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import as there are numerous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France.


However, thanks to an increase in the number of reported metal detected finds, Bronze Age bronze arrowheads are now growing in number, though they remain a rare group of artefact. Dr Colin Pendleton reports that Suffolk has 17 known examples, of which 5 can be termed barbed and tanged. Norfolk has at least 4 recorded and more examples are being added to the database from around the country. This suggests that bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition.


The arrowhead reported here is the first known from Essex and as such is an important discovery for the county, as well as adding to the growing British corpus. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age to the Middle Bronze Age, the evidence from Penard, which dates from 1275-1140 BC, suggests that copper alloy arrowheads did not come into fashion until later in the Middle Bronze Age. Therefore this is the suggested date range for this arrowhead.


Thanks are extended to Dr Stuart Needham of the British Museum for his opinion on this artefact.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,5.1,,,2.56,39.76,1,Caroline McDonald,Caroline McDonald,Eastern,Essex,Uttlesford,Hadstock,,,,,ESS-A41D75,,Barker arrowhead 2 to 1.jpg,Bronze Age copper alloy arrowhead 2:1,Colchester Museums,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cmcdonald/Barker arrowhead 2 to 1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/33331.jpg
72437,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1300,"An incomplete cast bronze axehead (length: 87.1mm; width: 37mm; thickness: 30.5mm; weight: 197.41g).  The butt of the axe has been broken and is badly corroded with some small areas of bronze disease.  The septum's length from the butt to the stop of the axe measures 66mm (as well as a width of 19mm), with low flanges measuring between 5-7mm in height either side.  The blade end of the axe has broken off 21mm after the stop, but this is far enough to notice a central rib running down its length on both sides, leading to what would have been the blade. The flange side is triangular in shape with a loop protruding outwards by 7.2mm level to where the stop is.  Overall, this incomplete axehead is in a fair but corroded condition in some areas, particularly  at the butt, flange facets and beyond the stop.  It is difficult to identify the true colour and patina of the axehead and the artefact has been coated in a substance, but it seems to have a patchy brown/ black patina with various areas of bronze disease.


This axehead seems to have similarities with other examples identified as from the Taunton industries, so called because of an especially rich series of finds that was made in the Vale of Taunton, dating from approximately 1400-1300 BC (Rohl & Needham, 1998, page 119, figure 21).  According to Pearce (1984, page 24), side loops became a regular feature in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age palstave industries, and the ribbed decoration was still popular from earlier examples.  A similar example of a ribbed palstave is illustrated in Pearce's book (Page 25, Fig 8a, Ref A) and was found at Cemmaes, Powys.

75136,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-900,"Complete, cast copper alloy Middle Bronze Age, side looped, spearhead. This spearhead has a narrow leaf shaped blade with a lozenge shaped section. The shaft is circular in section and socketed. To either side of the shaft, halfway along its length, is a lozenge or leaf shaped side loop, both of which are slightly flattened against the shaft. There is no peg hole on the shaft. The casting seams are not visible, except for a raised but smoothed seam of metal above one of the side loops. The original surface is mostly intact and has a mid brown patina. The object has suffered damage in a variety of forms. The surface is pitted and scratched, notable at the blade tip and along the mid rib. The edges of the blade are chipped. There is a subsquare nick at the mouth of the socket that has caused two cracks to run up the shaft to just below one of the side loops, and a triangular nick that has not resulted in cracking. There is also a sub oval hole running from one of the side loops. These signs of damage are worn smooth and evenly patinated suggesting that they occurred in antiquity. However there is a large amount of scratching to the object surface, which may be the result of more modern damage, possibly over harsh cleaning. There are also two grooves on the object that are shiny bronze in colour that are definitely due to recent damage.



The socket of the spearhead is blocked with compacted soil, as are the side loops. Under microscopic inspection there are traces of a fibrous material that may be leather or heavily decayed wood, but not enough survives to get a positive identification. The soil is probably compacted due to the post depositional environment. Because of this blockage, it is not known how far the socket extends into the shaft. The spearhead is 145.06mm long, of which 54.34mm is the shaft, 28.56mm at the widest point of the blade and 10.72mm thick at the mid rib. The socket mouth has a diameter of 18.78mm. The side loops are 18mm long and the bottom of the loop begins 20.78mm from the end of the shaft. The object weighs 72.75g. A parallel for this spearhead can be seen in Ehrenberg, 1977 number 25.

The surviving portion is wedge shaped, with rectangular faces which are almost straight when seen from the side, and that meet to form a curving blade edge that appears to have had little secondary bevel. The sides, when looking at the face, are slightly concave along the length, curving outwards to the blade. The middle of the blade edge has broken off in the past, but appears once to have a narrow curve of maybe 120°, with no flaring of the tips; the rounded tips are 19.31m apart. The hollow interior is cone-shaped. The artefact has a sub-rectangular cross-section with walls between 2.06mm and 4.34mm thick. The artefact has been broken off at the end, but it appears that part of the butt is still present: if this is correct then the artefact was once around 47-50mm in length. There is a casting seam running along one face. There is no decoration on the artefact, suggesting an everyday rather than ceremonial purpose. The artefact is very worn, with heavy corrosion, although some of the original smooth surface survives (around 40%), with a light greenish-grey colour. The rest has a mottled, greenish-grey colour, and a very pitted texture. All the evidence points towards this being a tool for carving wood- that is for ornamental carving. The round blade edge would make it versatile, enabling the carver to work with a concave area, and the bevel of the whole tool- at around 20°, makes it ideal for very fine work where thin slivers of wood are being removed. This is a fine ¾ inch chisel.

On either side of the socket, the humped remains of two side loops are still visible. They are also of irregular size as one appears larger than the other (width: 5.9mm x 4.2mm).



There is a similar example illustrated in Watson's 'Catalogue of British & European Prehistoric Metal in Birmingham City Museums', 1993, page 11, ref no 87, found in Kingsbury, Warwickshire. There are other examples in Susan M. Pearce's publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain', Part ii, 1983, found in numerous areas, but most notably Hambledon Hill, Hod Hill, Cheddar, near Blandford Camp and near Glastonbury. H. N. Savory in 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections', 1980, pages 49-51, adds that 'side-looped' spearheads were heavily produced in local North Wales industries with loops further up the socket in comparison with previous examples as well as having leaf-shaped blades. These spearheads were also popular in southern England.



This example may have had a short stabbing blade (mostly likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age I between c. 1450-1250 BC) or a longer weapon (mostly likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age II period between c. 1250-1050 BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2001-01-01T00:00:00Z,2001-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,13.81,,13.7,,52.8,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Swynnerton,SJ8538,From finder,52.939181,-2.224639,WMID-D2A721,,WMID-D2A721.jpg,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy Middle Bronze Age spearhead, dating between 1450-1050 BC.",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-D2A721.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/37755.jpg

With only a small part of the septum, butt and some of the side loop missing, the axehead is otherwise complete, even though it is in a very badly corroded state.  The flanges to either side of the septum are very slight (possibly also due to corrosion), as is the stop.  There are remains of one side loop positioned at the stop.  The blade is rather chunky in form without any indentations or ridges beyond the stop.  The blade tip and cutting end only spans slightly.  The general condition of the axehead is poor and corroded with only a few patches of the original dark green patina left near the stop and around the centre of the artefact.

H. N.

Socketed axeheads represent a change in the method of hafting and production (by hollow casting), particularly in comparison with the earlier flat and palstave axes.

  The socket rim is a rectangular with rounded corners and edges. The rim on the exterior of the axe is moulded with a single ridge which tapers towards the body of the axe. The rim is regular, therefore the socket mouth is also a rectangular shape. The interior of the socket is smooth, no casting seams or ribs are visible. 


  
  The body of the axe is short and wide. The blade tips flare outwards quickly, and they are asymmetrical. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical, this maybe due to ware, or the cutting edge being slightly abraded. Otherwise the cutting edge is quite sharp. 


  
  The sides are straight until they reach the blade tips. They have casting seams visible. One side has the integral semi-circular loop positioned near the rim. In section the loop is a sub-lozenge shape, which is mainly due to the casting seams. 


  
  The exterior surface of the axe has a patchy surface which has the start of a patina. There is some recent damage, scrapes, on the surface.

There is a midrib clearly down the centre of the blade's length on one side, with an indication of a worn midrib on the other side.  The blade tip and cutting edge are no longer visible due to corrosion and wear.  The flat side flanges extend from the butt to the blade edge, which seems to be a common appearance in what Rowlands classifies as a Class 2 type.  Medial ribs on the blade face are also a more common feature of this type (M J Rowlands, 'The Organisation of Middle Bronze Age Metalworking: Part I: Discussion', 1976, page 30).

Blade-end fragment from a Bronze Age axehead of uncertain type and date. The axe is represented by the end of the blade only and no evidence survives on the broken section for the bottom of a socket. The blade edge and the blade tips have also been lost. The sides of the axe are diverging, possibly resulting in a recurved blade edge. The faces are slightly convex, resulting in an oval section. The axe would have been comparatively slender, probably suggesting the fragment was from a palstave or socketed axe.

85353,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-950,-750,"Two co-joining blade fragments from a sword of Bronze Age date. None of the diagnostic features are present on the blade fragments, but the sword is likely to be a Ewart Park type sword of the Ewart Park metalworking tradition, c. 950 - 750BC. The sword blade is leaf-shaped and is widest at the centre of the fragment. The combined fragments (c. 300mm) probably represent a little over three quarters of the original blade length and approximately half the original length of the sword. The blade has a low lozenge shaped section, with a rounded mid-section and slightly concave outer section. The blade edges have been lost, but the start of the bevel is discernible in areas. The blade appears to have been bent prior to breaking, as evidenced by visible metal stress on the inside of the bend either side of the fracture. The sword bent by an angle of approximately 25 degrees before breaking. The bending has also resulted in both fragments being curved along their length. The sword was probably bent and broken prior to its deposition. One of the ends (probably the tip end) has deep parallel striations running along the blade on the mid section, which are also likely to have occurred in antiquity. The blade has a dark green patina, with small areas of surface loss. The fragments' length is 170mm hilt end and 132.5mm tip end. Its surviving width closest to the hilt is 26mm and its surviving width closest to tip is 23mm. The fragments' maximum width is 33.5mm. The thickness at the hilt end is 8.5mm and the thickness at the tip end (i.e. the minimum thickness) is 6.8mm. The overall maximum thickness is 8.8mm and the thickness at the break is 8.1mm.

The socket is gently convex below the blade, giving it the impression of bowing-out. The base of the socket is circular to the position of the circular peg holes (6mm diameter), positioned 40mm from the end. Above the peg holes, side and face ridges develop, giving the socket a sub-square profile. The side ridges run into the beginning of the blade and the face ridges develop into a pointed midrib, which continues to the tip. The blade is flame-shaped and comparatively slender. The blade is solid and the faces are very gently concave. The blade edge is stepped and survives along most of the length. The spearhead is in very good condition with crisp features. The casting seams have been removed and are not visible. The spearhead measures 287mm in length. The maximum external diameter of the socket base is 29.1-30.0mm. The maximum blade width is 52.0mm.

86585,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-700,"Bronze Age tanged and collared chisel fragment, likely to be of Late Bronze Age date. The chisel is represented by the blade, collar, and the beginning of the tang and has a surviving length of 44.7mm. The tang has broken just above the collar, which survives as a low transverse ridge on each face and is more projecting on the sides. The collar has a surviving width of 8.7mm, but is very worn. The thickness at this point is 6.2mm. The blade is crinoline in plan with a gently curved cutting edge of 16.6mm width. Much of the original surface has been lost and the chisel is eroded.","Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



The crinoline shape of the blade is quite unusual and reminiscent of some Middle Bronze Age palstave forms, though is less well-known from later contexts. Additionally, later collars are typically more prominent. This may suggest this is an earlier form of tanged and collared chisel.



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65).

There is a highly pronounced rib running up the centre of the fragment on either side illustration the continuation of the socket, forming a central square-sectioned profile with the wings to either side as well.

The axehead is a small example with a length of 77.8mm, and is also comparatively slender with a width at the bevel of 19.9mm. The butt is rounded and the sides are near-parallel (with a width at the butt of 18.2mm) as far as the bevel. After the bevel, the sides curve very gently outwards as far as the blade, where the sides turn out sharply to the blade tips, producing an expanded cutting edge with a surviving width of 39.0mm. The edges of the faces are raised slightly (1mm), but have been eroded and the sides are convex across their thickness. The faces are flat either side of the bevel, which is positioned 34mm from the butt. The blade begins 17mm from the edge. The surface of the axe has been largely lost, in addition to the cutting edge and one of the blade tips.","Class 4 axes straddle the boundary between Periods 2 and 3, but this axe can be confidently assigned to Period 3, probably falling within the late Aylesford to Willerby metalworking phases (c.1950-1750 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

BC), falling within the later half of Period 4 (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997).



The axe is incomplete, missing the butt and one of the blade tips. The axe has a surviving length of 73.5mm and would have had an approximate length of 110mm when complete. The sides are straight and near parallel, with a width at the septum of 28.2mm. The flanges and sides are gently rounded and convex, with a maximum height of 15.6mm. The sides have hammered decoration of diagonal markings. The sides curve out sharply just above the blade to produce a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. The blade face is slightly convex, while the face is slightly dished. There is a straight median bevel and the axe has a thickness at the bevel of 12.2mm. Both faces have a number of small hammer marks of c. 2mm diameter. Sharpening striations running along the cutting edge are evident on both faces.

The spearhead is corroded and incomplete, missing most of the blade and some of the socket on one face. The spearhead has a surviving height of 82.6mm and a maximum external diameter at the mouth of 18mm. The sides of the socket converge comparatively sharply towards the beginning of the blade. The socket continues along the blade to form a prominent rounded midrib. The sides of the socket are slightly pronounced and have the suggestion of side or socket loop stubs approximately 11mm apart. Much of the socket on one face is missing; some of this may be the result of miscasting (where the core has been incorrectly aligned), rather than later damage. The socket has a surviving depth of 63mm. The remnants of the blade are evident on both sides, but little of the blade survives. The spearhead weighs 25.6g (after cleaning).","This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.646) and classed within his Group 6 Developed side-looped, though due to this objects incompleteness it could not be assigned a sub-type. Davis (2012) notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades, which might strengthen the idea that this spearhead originally had a flame-shaped blade, rather than a leaf-shaped blade. The spearhead is likely to have been quite short and can be paralleled with a number of similar examples in National Museum & Galleries of Wales' collections (Savory 1980, Nos. 227-230).



A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has recently been dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.

The spearhead is complete and is a relatively long and slender example of the type, with a length of 163mm and maximum width across the blade of 26.3mm. The spearhead weighs 74.0g. The circular socket end has an external diameter at the mouth of 17.8mm. The end of the socket is decorated with three horizontal grooves around the circumference. The sides of the socket converge towards the blade. Midway between the blade and the end of the socket are attachment loops with oval tops (external dimensions 15 x 5mm). The socket becomes increasingly lozenge sectioned as it approaches the blade. The flame shaped blade is slender and is comparatively slight with a consistent thickness of 1mm and without a bevelled blade edge. The blade has a number of possibly decorative grooves running alongside the midrib. The blade edge is straight and comparatively long (90mm) and has a number of nicks and distortions; this damage is likely to have occurred in antiquity (M. Davis pers comm.). The lozenge sectioned socket develops into pointed and prominent midribs along the blade. A number of small casting flaws are evident on the blade. The surface of the spearhead has survived well and has a mid brown patina. Northover (unpublished) sees socket looped spearheads as a largely Irish type. The type has been known to occur through late Acton Park to Pennard but concentrated in the Cemmaes industry. The mouth decoration, thin and slender blade and pointed midrib on this example are a little unusual. The mouth decoration can be paralleled on a side-looped spearhead from Hod Hill (Pearce 1983, No. 443) and the slender form can be paralleled in examples recorded by Ehrenberg (1977, nos. 25, 26, 28, 140, 143).","This spearhead has been published by Davis (2012, No.290) and classed within his Type 6B Developed side-looped (Flame, flat blade, lozenge plates). Davis (2012, 76f.) lists 83 of this type of spearhead from Britain, with a concentration around the Thames Valley and a spread across Central England and Wales.

The socketed gouge dates to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1100-750BC and dates to the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (Needham et al. 1997), corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period's 6-7. The gouge is comparatively short, with an overall length of 55.6mm. The socket is oval with an external width (across the blade) of 21.3mm and an external height of 19.7mm (internal: 17.7 x 16.6mm). The mouth of the gouge is plain, and 2.4mm beneath the mouth is a square collar moulding, with a width of 2mm. The sides of the gouge are slightly concave and expand at the blade tips, giving a width at the blade of 18.6mm. The casting flashes are visible on both sides and have minimal finishing. On one side, the flashes have been hammered for most of the length but are high and sharp near the collar. On the other side the flashes may have not been finished and are deep and wide. The blade edge largely survives and is convex. Sharpening striations are evident on the blade and run both along the blade and perpendicular to it. The surface of the gouge survives well with a dark brown patina. The under-face has an unusual linear effect, possibly the result of a mineralised organic. The gouge weighs 40.1g. The finder responsibly did not clean out the socket of the gouge. Excavation of the socket revealed remnants of the wooden handle preserved. The wood has been retained at NMGW.","Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilburton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. Potential radiocarbon dating of the wood recovered from the socket could be useful in resolving this problem. The gouge can be paralleled with a larger and unprovenanced example in the Macalpine collection (Antiquities from Europe and the Near East, No. 11.61).



David Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class III, which is characterised by its small, squat form and limited mouth mouldings, though typically this Class has a wider cutting edge.",3,Copper alloy,Wood,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,40.1,,,,55.6,1,Mark Lodwick,Katrina Deering,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Llaneugrad,SH4783,,53.321749,-4.298508,NMGW-283DE4,,DSCN3377.JPG,Bronze Age socketed gouge,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/DSCN3377.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/626259.jpg

 Only a fragment of the blade and hilt remain. In plan it is an inverted sub triangle. The sides are straight, tapering to a broken edge. The upper corners of the sides form a ‘)’ and ‘(‘ shape as it is broken across two rivet holes. The patina remains on the curvature of the rivet holes. Above the rivet holes the object is again broken.

93081,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-2000,-1700,"Cast copper alloy incomplete flat axe with the beginnings of a stop ridge and flanged sides dating to the Early Bronze Age c.2000-1700 BC. The blade end of the axe is corroded but the angle suggests that it may have had a crescentic blade. Both faces of the axe are decorated with straight lines punched into the axe after casting, about 5mm in length, and about 1mm apart, in what is referred to as a 'rain pattern'. The axe is 113mm long, 52mm wide at the blade end, 23mm wide at the butt end, 10mm in thickness and weighs 186.03g.

    
    Comparable examples of decorated flat axes from the Southwest can be found in Pearce (1983) from Southleigh in Devon (p.455 & 600, Plate 39 No.297) and from Mount Pleasant in Dorset (p.468 & 609, Plate 48, No.371). But the decoration on this axe covers the whole axe and is more regular and evenly spaced like the example from Preston Down, Weymouth (p.487 & 621, Plate 60, No.480). There is also a similar example in the Royal Institution of Cornwall’s collections from Ladock where there are marks between the flanges, but these are sparse and irregular.

    
    Flat axes decorated with this ‘rain pattern’ and with crescentic blades can be found during the Mile Cross-Aylesford phase (c.2000-1900 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl& Needham 1998, 124, Fig. 25, No.47). Examples with the continuous rain-pattern are found in the following Willerby-Bush Barrow phase (c.1900-1700 BC), such as the Class 4 axes illustrated in Rohl & Needham (1998, 125, Fig. 26, No.57 & B).",,3,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2000-08-31T23:00:00Z,2000-11-30T00:00:00Z,,,186.03,,,10,113,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Lesnewth,SX1191,From a paper map,50.687875,-4.67704,CORN-C53643,,Osbornefinds 006.jpg,detail of blade showing rain pattern,Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Osbornefinds 006.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/57949.jpg

Due to the short, stocky body of axes of this type, they is referred to as 'bag-shaped' or 'purse-shaped'.  The axe's exact measurements are:  57mm in length, the blade width is 43mm, the width of the socket is 31-37mm (inner-outer), the breadth of the socket is 22-27mm (inner-outer, back-front) and the axe weighs 78.97g. These measurements show that the mouth of the axe is aligned with the blade and not back-to-front shaped. The blade was re-worked after the casting process and it is still slightly splayed. However, the axe was in use and it was re-sharpened as well; there are indications of parallel re-sharpening marks close to the cutting edge. The axe was thinly cast and possibly the alloy used was probably more tinny than the normal alloy - the mouth has shows a crack which probably happened while it was in use. However, the damage was obviously no reason to discard the axe.


This socketed axe type is called 'Irish' because most of them were found in Ireland - however, a great number were also found in Scotland, Wales and N/W and S/W England.

The axe is complete and is comparatively small with a length of 72.7mm and a weight of 181.2g, possibly suggesting a lead rich bronze. The mouth has external dimensions of 44.0 x 37.6mm and has the four casting runner stubs visible. The socket has an oval profile at the mouth with internal dimensions of 30 x 26.5mm and is 58.4mm deep. The axe has a single mouth moulding, which tapers to the face. The loop springs from the base of the moulding. The casting flashes are prominent on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The axe body has a more rounded form than is usual for the type with a sub-rectangular section of 37mm width below the loop. Both faces are decorated with three, widely spaced converging weak ribs. The blade is recurved, producing a rounded blade edge with a length of 45.5mm. The axe has a green to brown patina and has recently been coated in a varnish.","This axe possesses a combination of features typically of two well-established axe types. Stylistically this axe shares many properties with Yorkshire-type axes, which are defined by widely-spaced ribs descending from a fairly prominent, slightly everted collar, and often have a small, stumpy appearance with an expanded blade edge (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 223). However, ribs on Yorkshire type axes typically run parallel or slightly diverge; no examples could be found in Schmidt and Burgess's corpus of Yorkshire axes possessing converging ribs. Similarly, the rounded socket is unusual. Furthermore, the four runner casting technology is a feature found solely in the production of South Wales axes. South Wales axes often have prominent casting seams, as seen on the Penllyn axe, and converging ribs, though these are typically not as widely-spaced.



This axe is thus best seen as a hybrid of two axe-making traditions. In form it most closely parallels Yorkshire axes, but it was produced using South Wales production methods and incorporates features of this latter axe type. These axes were in contemporary production in different regions and thus it is not inconceivably that the technologies might permeate into other areas. Yorkshire-type socketed axes have been found alongside South Wales axes in the hoards from Llantilio Crossenny 2, Monmouthshire (NMGW-AFDAE8), Tal y garn 2, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt and Lodwick 2003), and Llangwm, Monmouthsire (Lodwick and Gwilt 2001).

The chisel is complete and is 98.3mm long. The tang is of square section and tapers to a curved edge. The base of the tang is defined by a rounded collar moulding, 6.2mm thick and 8.0mm wide. The blade sides diverge in a near straight (slightly concave) to a gently curved cutting edge of 24.3mm width. Some of the original surface survives on the chisel with a mid-green patina. The chisel weighs 18.1g.","Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65).

The fragment has a surviving length of 27.1mm and a maximum surviving width at the break of 15.9mm. The butt is neatly rounded and has a thickness of 1.3mm. The sides are straight and diverge gently before the break. The sides are rounded and the flanges are marked by facets. The faces are flat except for the low flanges, which have a maximum surviving height of 0.5mm. At the break the fragment has a thickness of 8.2mm across the flanges and 7.3mm across the septum. The fragment weighs 15.8g. The fragment appears to have come from a well cast axe and has been neatly finished. One face has a silvery appearance, possibly because of surface enrichment of tin. The surface is in good condition with dark green to brown patina.","This fragment probably once belonged to a Class 4 or Class 5 axe (following Needham 1983), and dated to the MA V Willerby to MA VI Arreton phases of the Early Bronze Age (c.1750-1500 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

99336,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-800,"Cast copper alloy sword fragment with rounded point end and broken upper blade with the rest of the blade and hilt missing. The sides of the blade come to a point and there is a central ridge running up and down the blade, resembling the Ewart Park type sword shape in plan, which widens towards the bottom half of the blade. The fragment is lozenge-shaped in section, without a pronounced central ridge, which is typical of this type of sword section.
          The sword fragment is 47 mm long, 38 mm wide, 1.8 mm thick at the rounded end and 7.5 mm thick at the broken blade end, and 52.84g in weight.
    Needham (1998) illustrates two Ewart type swords on page 135, Fig.37, Nos.386-7.
    Pearce (1985) illustrates similar examples on p.460 & 467, Plate 145 b&e, Nos.325 & 365, from Devon and Cranborne, Dorset, respectively, which are dated to the Ewart Park phase.

99337,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"Cast copper alloy socketed ferrule of a triangular basal-looped spearhead with the remains of the base of the loops on either side of the broken ferrule. Beyond these protrusions there are on either side about 10 mm of the base of the blade in the form of a slight ridge. The blades would have been leaf-shaped and bevelled. The ferrule has a long hollow socket which is circular in section and tapers towards the broken blade end. The opposite end of the socket is also damaged but the surface of the ferrule is in good condition, having a rich green shiny patina.

Similar examples can be found in Pearce (1983) from Lynton in Devon on page 448, Plate 34, No.270, and from Pimperne in Dorset on page 478, Plate 54, No.430b. The latter was found with a side-looped palstave. These types of spear-head are generally dated to the Penard phase (c.1300-1150 BC), as is an example from Maentwog, Gwynedd in Pearce (1984) page 38, Plate 10, which was found in a hoard with flat-ribbed rapiers.

The gouge itself is worn, possibly from water action, and is incomplete, most of the mouth having broken off.  There are a pair of faint incised transverse lines, presumably decoration, just below the mid- way point, around the back of the gouge.  The gouge measures 72.36mm in length, 18.14mm-20.07mm in width and it weighs 54g.  The wooden handle, which is shaped to fit the socket is 73.15mm long, 12.75mm-13.43mm wide and weighs 7g.

100259,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-600,"An incomplete tip of a cast bronze socketed axehead, dating from c. 1050-600 BC (length: 24.9mm; width: 45.8mm; thickness: 12.4mm; weight: 54.10g).  This rounded tip has a very blunted and possibly unfinished blade and only a small part of the bottom of the socket mouth is visible as a slight sub-rectangular indentation.  This artefact is in a worn and poor condition with a patchy dark brown patina remaining, although the object seems to have been coated in a substance.

In 'Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age', savory states that the socketed axe-head represents a change both in the method of hafting and the method of production.  This involves the adoption of a handle with a single knee-shaft prong, as well as the use of hollow casting and the 'cire perdue' process.",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-05-30T23:00:00Z,,,,54.1,,,12.4,24.9,1,Caroline Johnson,Caroline Johnson,West Midlands,Staffordshire,South Staffordshire,Saredon,SJ9407,From a paper map,52.660686,-2.090144,WMID-14AC46,,WMID-14AC46.jpg,"An incomplete tip of a Bronze Age socketed axehead, dating from c. 1050-600 BC.",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/cjohnson/WMID-14AC46.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/67860.jpg
