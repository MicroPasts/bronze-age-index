594585,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A folded fragment of a Middle Bronze Age gold bracelet or ring with a bundle of compressed gold ribbons wedged within the fold. (c. 1500-c. 1100 BC). Treasure case no. 2014 T15.



The object is largely sub-rectangular in plan, rectangular in cross-section and has been folded widthways through c. 180Â°. The narrow end is in the form of a hook-like terminal and is square in cross-section. The sides flare outwards from the hook to form a 'tab' with a break at the end. Part of the break is uneven and probably accidental and the other part has been deliberately chopped obliquely. Both faces are plain and have small scuffs and scratches. The bundle is formed by numerous thin and narrow ribbons which have been tightly compressed together. Following its discovery the bundle was detached by the finder in order to remove soil.



The artefact is closely paralleled by two conjoined objects classified as rings (possibly ear ornaments), from Binstead, West Sussex (TAR: 1998-1999, p. 10-11, fig. 3a).



A similar object, classified as a bracelet, has been recorded from Northfleet, Kent (TAR: 2004 T326; PAS: KENT-AAA333).



In discussing the Kent bracelet, Stuart Needham has commented:



'Its features do match those of a type of bracelet which occurs in just two Welsh hoards, from Capel Isaf, Dyfed, and Maesmelan Farm, Powys. The type, known as Capel Isaf, comprises a flat band strengthened by triangular-section beadings along either edge. At either terminal the band tapers quickly to a hooked tang, one of which is rod-like, the other a flatter strip; these two interlock to close the bracelet. The Northfleet fragment appears to have had a narrower band than the Welsh parallels, but its metal composition is similar with low copper and between about 9 and 16 % silver. Making this identification does not necessarily offer definitive dating since the type is not associated with datable objects. The Capel Isaf hoard contains, in addition to two of this type, two more broad-band bracelets which are plainer in design, and a small fragment of twisted strip which is likely to be the terminal of another ornament (Savory 1977: 37-53; Savory 1980: no 302, 195 fig. 46, pl. VIII). The Maesmelan Farm hoard has a simple rectangular section penannular bracelet in association with one of Capel Isaf type (Green et al 1983: 394-398). The prevailing opinion is that these are of Bronze Age date and, if so, they are likely to date to before the middle of the Bronze Age (circa 1500/1400 BC), after which the copper content of the gold rises significantly. A mature Early Bronze Age or earliest Middle Bronze Age date is feasible and would tie in with a similar date for the Heyope ribbon torcs with similar terminals from a hoard in Powys.'



Bracelet or ring: 32.61mm (length); 65.80mm (length if straightened); 15.38mm (width); 1.29mm (thickness). Weight: 7.81g.



Bundle: 13.21mm (length); 11.9mm (width); 4.29mm (thickness); 0.89mm (width of individual piece of ribbon). Weight: 1.39g.



Overall weight: 9.20g.



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a group of eight ornaments was undertaken by Sue La Niece at the British Museum. It indicated a surface composition for the bracelet fragment of approximately 89-91% gold, 8-10 % silver with approximately 1% copper. The surface composition of the wire is approximately 86-88% gold, approximately 10-12% silver and approximately 1% copper.The full report is appended.",The find contains a minimum of 10% gold and predates 1714.

595407,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1140,"An incomplete copper alloy Bronze Age (1275-1140 BC) arrowhead, missing its tip and the ends of the barbs. There is a large crack where the tang joins the rest of the arrowhead, which has nearly split it into two parts.



Cast in a two piece mould, this arrowhead is barbed and tanged in form, with the two sides forming an angle of approximately 30 degrees. It is 41.50mm long (approximately 20mm of the original length is missing), 17.45mm wide from barb to barb, 3.20mm thick and weighs 5.46g. The tang is complete and measures c.22.90mm long, 8.20mm wide and 2.50mm thick. The arrowhead has a low mid rib, giving the object a lozengiform section. Much of the original surface survives with a dark green patina, but it is heavily scratched and pitted. The exposed surfaces are mid green in colour, but there are patches of red suggesting it was deposited in ground containing iron.



There is only one bronze arrowhead from a secure Bronze Age context in Britain and that was in the Penard hoard, first reported in Archaeologica 71, page 138. The Penard arrowhead also has a mid rib. At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import as there are numerous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France.



However, thanks to an increase in the number of reported metal detected finds, Bronze Age bronze arrowheads are now growing in number, though they remain a rare group of artefact. Dr Colin Pendleton reports that Suffolk has 17 known examples, of which 5 can be termed barbed and tanged. Norfolk has at least 4 recorded and more examples are being added to the database from around the country. This suggests that bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition.



Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age to the Middle Bronze Age, the evidence from Penard, which dates from 1275-1140 BC, suggests that copper alloy arrowheads did not come into fashion until later in the Middle Bronze Age. Therefore this is the suggested date range for this arrowhead.

595700,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete developed flat axe with hammer raised flanges of later Early Bronze Age date (c. 2000 CAL BC to c. 1700 CAL BC).



Around 25% of the axehead is present, with the blade and part of the body present. The butt and rest of the body is missing, presumed lost in antiquity. The break is patinated, suggesting that it happened in antiquity.



The axehead is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. At the break, the body of the axehead measures 26.4 mm wide and 12.9 mm thick. Neither the septum or the median bevel are present. The flanges are lozenge-shaped and are likely to have been raised rather than cast. In profile they are D shape and eroded projecting a maximum of 1.0 mm above the body of the axe. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 68.0 mm. There are a series of patinated striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These may be a result of sharpening the cutting edge.



Overall the developed axe fragment measures 47.7 mm in length, 68.0 mm wide and 12.2 mm thick. It weighs 94.9 g.



The axe is a mid brown colour with an even surface patina. There are a couple of areas of pitting where the patina is no longer present, leaving a lighter green area.



Although incomplete the classification of the axe matches the descriptions and illustrations of the axe type Arreton ( (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp65 - 75 specifically 409, 411 and 421) which is dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 CAL BC to 1700 CAL BC. Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

discussion of the type, taken from HESH-07CD71: This axe can be classified as a Socked Axe of type Meldreth, possibly being sub-classified as a Variant Aylsham. This style / type of axe has a common distribution in the East of England. The majority of axes of this style have historically been found in the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire. The distribution pattern continues to a lesser degree in South-East England (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981: 211). However, a number of Meldreth Type axes have been found in hoards associated with South-Wales Types and Ewart Park Swords, for example the Stogursey Hoard, Somerset (ibid, 210). This is reflected in a local Marches distribution where they have been treated as exotics occurring in a Ewart Park phase hoard from Pencoyd, Herefordshire (HESH-802833) and a broken and damaged faceted axe from Westbury, Shropshire (HESH-F8A521).",Found very close to BH-A50566 (2013T655) and BH-0E91D6.

It is very damaged and corroded, but roughly sub-triangular in form and with a lozenge section and a wide hemispherical rib running along the centre of each face. The flattened sections to either side of this are very damaged and the tip is missing. At the other end is an irregular break with a slight dimple in the centre suggesting that the spear had a socket. There is a thick brown patina that is missing in a few places revealling a green inner core. It is likely to be of middle to late Bronze Age date (1500-800 BC) due to the socket and the lozenge section, although it lacks many key diagnostic features.

Less than 50% of the axehead is present, consisting only of part of the lower body, blade and the remnants of the socket. It is missing the top part of the socket and the also the loop. The axe is sub rectangular in plan, with an expanded / flared convex, but abraded cutting edge. The socket is sub rectangular in section. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to the base of socket is 9.8 mm. The break is old and patinated. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. Raised casting seams are present, along both sides, these have been trimmed and hammered flat / finished. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is incomplete. The sides do not appear to be faceted and no ribs are present on either the front or back of the axehead fragment. The axe is most likley to be of a North Wales ribbed type, or faceted axe with a large collar. The axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface. Multiple stratch marks are present on both the front and back of the axehead - these are modern and cut into the patinated surface.

The upper part of the blade and the lower part of the socket survive. The break between the two pieces is more recent than the other breaks.



The double edged blade has a flattened mid rib section with wide (4-5mm) concave edge bevels. The blade is 21.8mm wide at the socket end and 17.6mm wide at the break. It tapers from 6mm thick to 5.1mm thick.



The junction between the socket and blade was straight. The socket is sub rectangular in section and has straight sides. It tapers in width from 23.7mm wide at the attachment end to 21.5mm at the narrowest point near the blade, and in thickness from 12.96mm at the attachment end to 7.8mm at the blade end, then flares widthways and thickens immedieately before the blade to 24.8mm by 7.85mm. There is a single circular peghole through both faces of the socket in the centre of the surviving piece. It has a diameter of 4.5 - 5mm. The walls of the socket are about 2mm thick.

The blade fragment is sub trapezoidal in plan, and lentoid in cross section. The blade tapers towards either edge. The edges to the top and bottom are old, pre depostional breaks. The remains of a circular rivet hole are present on the top edge. No decoration is present on either the front or back of the blade.



It measures 63.5 mm in length, has a maximum width of 19.3 mm and a minimum of 13.4 mm. It is 3.1 mm thick in the centre of the blade and 1.2 mm thick along the blade edges. It weighs 13.0 g.



The blade fragment is a mid to dark brown colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has been removed in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze diseases) occurring. This would be a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue and silica gel.","A similar blade fragment was recorded as WMID-277BF6. On that record, Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) noted that: As for the blade fragment - from the size I think you are looking at either a large dagger or probably more likely a rapier fragment. The hilt would have been trapezoidal - and it has lost its rivets and upper part - it has also lost the shoulders but you can then see the blade thickening away from the hilt to for the mid rib. I expect the other end continued for maybe 1/3 again as the rib is parallel even if the sides aren't due to plough roll.

Immediately behind the head, the shaft narrows to 4.3mm diameter before expanding into a swollen area with a maximum diameter of 6.34mm diameter. The shaft then tapers again to the well patinated break.



The whole of the surviving shaft is decorated, though the surface layer of the pin is missing in places. below the expanded head are five circumferential grooves, then a panel of longitudinal diagonal lines form chevrons. the thickest part of the swelling is decorated with diagonal cross hatching, flanked on each side by another five circumferential grooves. The lower shaft is more damaged, but appears to be another panel of diagonal cross hatching and another band of circumferential lines.

It is missing the ends of both lower tips due to old, patinated breaks. The object is cast in the round with a swollen oval body that tapers downwards at both sides to the now incomplete pointed terminals giving it an inverted U-shaped form. At the centre of the body is a slight vertical band or constriction, either side of which the exterior surfaces of the object has decoration comprising multiple ridges and grooves. These run from the central constriction towards the pointed terminals, finishing just before the sides narrow to the terminals. Unlike some parallels, this object is not perforated.



All the surfaces of the object have a dark grey green patina, with some pitting and patches of corrosion in places.

Examples from the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998) were found alongside Bronze Age metalwork but with deposition in the Iron Age. Examples from Suffolk (SF-520513 and SF-9183) were found loosely associated with a scatter of Middle Bronze Age finds, as was an example from Methwold, Norfolk, and more recently an example from an excavated Middle Bronze Age context from Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (cf.

The sides are very gently concave before diverging at the blade to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (59.1mm wide), with some damage to one of the blade tips and the blade edge. The sides have a slight bevel to the casting seam at the centre, producing a sub-rectangular to hexagonal body section. Both casting seams are clearly discernible and have been fettled, probably by hammering. The faces are decorated with near-parallel ribs; one face has five ribs, while the other has three ribs with the edges enhanced with a rib each. Both faces are slightly convex across their widths. The faces and gradually converge and have a weak blade facet (26mm from the blade edge). The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved and sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces.



Axe 2 probably Type Welby Found c.3cm below axe 1 with blade to the east The axe is complete (with a length of 97.8mm and a weight of 267.1g). The sub-oval mouth (44.9mm x 41.7mm) is flat-topped, slightly bevelled outwards. Only one casting stub is now evident with the casting seams on the sides but is likely to have been two-runner casting technology. The socket is sub-oval at the mouth (34.0mm x 30.5mm and 74.7mm deep), with sides gradually converging to its base. There is a distinct dollar (16mm long), which is concave across its length and bounded by a horizontal moulding at its base. The casting flashes on the collar appear unfinished (with a height of up to 3.7mm); below the collar, the flashes have undergone more fettling from hammering. The sides are concave and are expanded at the blade (to give a blade width of 51.5mm) to produce a moderately rounded blade edge. The casting seams are not central but deeper to one side. The loop springs from the base of the collar and is of sub-triangular section (28mm long, 7.6mm wide, 4.4mm thick; with internal dimensions of 4.7mm long and 7.0mm high). The ribs also descend from the base of the collar; each face has three-ribs, which are convergent on one face and near-parallel on the other but are angled and are not parallel with the sides. The body section is sub-rectangular with convex faces and sides. The faces are also convex across their lengths. Weak blade facets are evident (18mm from the blade edge). The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved and some striations are evident below the patina, running perpendicular to the blade but are not consistent and may not be the result of sharpening.



Axe 3 South Wales (Stogursey) variant Type Found touching axe 4 The axe is complete (with a length of 89.0mm and a weight of 263.5g). The sub-rectangular mouth (48.5mm x 42.9mm) is flat-topped and has remnant stubs of four casting runners, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The socket is sub-rectangular at the mouth (34.8mm x 27.7mm and 70.8mm deep), with sides gradually converging to its base. The mouth has a single moulding (7mm long) sloping to the face (4-6mm high). The loop springs from just beneath the base of the moulding and is of irregular oval section (32.7mm long, 6.5mm wide, 5mm thick; with internal dimensions of 6.7mm long and 6.7mm high). The sides are very gently concave before diverging at the blade to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (59.1mm wide), with some damage to one of the blade tips and the blade edge. The sides have a slight bevel to the casting seam at the centre, producing a sub-rectangular to hexagonal body section. Both casting seams are clearly discernible and have been fettled, probably by hammering. The faces are decorated with near-parallel ribs; one face has five ribs, while the other has three ribs with the edges enhanced with a rib each. Both faces are slightly convex across their widths. The faces gradually converge and have a weak blade facet (26mm from the blade edge). The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved and sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces.



Axe 4 Type Found touching axe 3 The axe is complete (with a length of 91.2mm and a weight of 246.8g). The socket is sub-rectangular at the mouth (44.5mm x 37.1mm and 64.2mm deep), with concave sides gradually converging to its base. Traces of three, of the four runner stubs are evident on the mouth. The axe has a collar moulding (16mm long) with a slight concavity along its length. The loop springs from just above the base of the moulding and is of irregular triangular section (26mm long, 6.5mm wide, 6mm thick; with internal dimensions of 12.3mm long and 5.3mm high). The sides are concave, before diverging more sharply at the blade and produce a moderately expanded blade edge (53.5mm wide) and with moderate curve to the blade edge. The sides have prominent and high casting seams (up to 4.5mm high), suggesting minimal finishing and fettling. Either side of the casting seam, the sides are slightly convex across their widths, producing a sub-rectangular body section. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, descending from the base of the collar moulding. One face has three fine converging ribs, which are comparatively long and continue onto the blade (55m long, ending 21mm from the blade edge). The other face appears to have had wider ribs and which are parallel to each other. Both faces are convex across their widths and lengths. The faces gradually converge and have no discernible blade facet. Although the surface survives well on one face, there are no discernible sharpening striations on the blade. The surface has a dark-brown patina, partially preserved with green corrosion and forming a raised ridge on one face, suggesting the point of contact with axe 3.



Axe 5 Type Breiddin The axe is complete (with a length of 96.9mm and a weight of 212.8g). The socket is sub-rectangular at the mouth (39.4mm x 32.2mm and 64.0mm deep), with straight sides gradually converging to its base. Three possible runner stubs are discernible on the mouth but are not certain. The axe has a collar moulding (14mm long) with a slight concavity along its length. The loop springs from just above the base of the moulding and is of irregular lozenge section (24mm long, 6.5mm wide, 4mm thick; with internal dimensions of 12.0mm long and 5.4mm high). The sides are gently concave, before diverging more sharply at the blade and produce a moderately expanded blade edge (45.8mm wide) which is distinctly straight. The sides have prominent casting seams, with some, neat finishing and fettling and seemingly deliberately leaving the seam as a regular moulding. Either side of the casting seam, the sides are slightly convex across their widths, producing a sub-rectangular body section, which is more comparatively angular. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, descending from the base of the collar moulding (36mm - 40mm long). Both faces are gently convex across both their widths and lengths. The faces gradually converge and have no discernible blade facet. The surface has a dark-brown patina, with patches of surface loss on the both blades. There are a few striations running along the blade but not enough to convincingly suggest sharpening.","Formerly known as NMGW-C9E5A3, which was a duplicate ID caused by system error.",3,Copper alloy,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,,,,,,,,5,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Madley,SO3939,,52.04602109,-2.89086524,NMGW-C9E5A3Z,,Axe Head 5.jpg,Late Bronze Age bronze Axe 5,Mark Lodwick,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Axe Head 5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/458240.jpg

The terminals appear to have been twisted prior to the purported breaks (possibly in the process of breaking them). The band has several bends and distortions and it is not clear what the original profile of the band would have been. There are a number of scuffs and striations to both surfaces. Possible small hammer markings can be seen, particularly on one side of the band. The remnants of a possible small perforation (c.0.2mm diameter) can be seen on one of the broken shoulders/terminals.

Metal composition 



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a gold fragment found at 'the Wantage rally, Oxon', indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-88% gold, 10-12 % silver with approximately 1% copper.



Identification & discussion



The uncertainty regarding whether the terminals have been broken (and therefore the original form of the band) makes it difficult to be certain of its date. However, a number of parallels from the Portable Antiquities Scheme (Northfleet, Kent: Treasure Case 2004 T326, Brixton Deverill, Wiltshire: 2006 T250, Gussage-all-Saints, Dorset: 2013 T428 and Roche, Corwall: 2014 T39), and the metal composition of the band, suggest that a Bronze Age date is most likely. As Dr S. Needham pointed out in the report for Brixton Deverill (2006 T250): 'a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings'. The Wantage find could be positioned within this group and probably dates to the Middle to Later Bronze Age (c.1500/1400-800 cal. BC), rather than any earlier.",The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old. Consequently it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.,3,Gold,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,,,2013T674,,3.94,,,0.7,74.47,1,Neil Wilkin,Neil Wilkin,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Wantage,,,,,PAS-446915,,2013T674a.JPG,Gold strip,The British Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2013T674a.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/458922.jpg

A tip fragment of a potential leaf-shaped spearhead; the fragmentary nature of the object makes it difficult to identify with certainty. The object has a central rounded midrib which extends to the blade tip and the sides curve widely, indicting the overall leaf-shaped nature of the spearhead. The cross-section is lozenge shaped. The object has a smooth surface and is covered with green patina.




Max. Length: 31.4 mm, Max. Width: 26.6 mm, Max. Thickness: 5.3 mm; Weight: 10.6 g.




A fragment of a copper alloy socketed axe. The fragment consists of the mouth and an unlooped side of a socketed axe. Due to the fragmentary nature of the axe, it is difficult to confidently assign a type; however based on the mounded collar, mouth and overall slender appearance, it is possibly of South-Eastern type (Needham 1990, 28). The casting seams are visible and it would appear that the axe has been horizontally squashed, creating a pinched appearance. The object has a smooth surface and is covered with green patina; there is soil debris attached to the interior.

A damaged copper alloy socketed axe. One face is almost entirely complete, with a large piece of the cutting-edge missing; the other face is also missing a section of the mouth. The axe is undecorated and overall quite slender. The mouth is wide with casting remains on the rim, flashes are visible on the interior; the external casting seems are present on either side, but do not extend below the loop. Due to the fragmentary nature of the axe, it is difficult to ascertain a specific type, however it is likely of South-Eastern, Class A type (Needham 1990, 28). This type dates to the Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park phase, c. 920-800 BC (Needham et al. 1997, 82). The axe is covered with a green patina and the interior contains soil debris, which affects the object's weight.




Max. Length: 83.7 mm, Max. Width: 46.4 mm, Max. Thickness: 26.6 mm; Weight: 133.3 g.



The nature of this group of objects (ingot pieces and fragmentary objects) implies that they were deposited together and are related to the metalworking process, as they are typical of material which would be melted down and recycled.



The two socketed axe fragments are both likely to belong to the South-Eastern Type, Class A (Needham 1990, 28) and these objects can therefore be used to date the to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 920-800 BC). Parallel fragmentary examples have been found across Southern England, for example, as part of the Petters metalwork hoard (Needham 1990).



As the fragments (Nos. 1-21) are of Late Bronze Age date and appear to represent a single deposit of two or more copper alloy finds of prehistoric date, they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

The object consists of part of the open socket and one loop and part of the body of the probable axe. There is a casting seam visible that runs through and beyond the centre of the looped handle. The head-end of the object is flaring slightly, which is why it is assumed that this object represents a miniature axehead rather and any other type of tool. The patina and condition of this object suggests a Bronze Age date and although miniature objects were being made into the Roman period, full-sized axe heads of this type are known from the later Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,10.4,,,4.8,25.5,1,Anni Byard,Anni Byard,South East,Buckinghamshire,Aylesbury Vale,Aston Sandford,SP7607,From finder,51.7565422,-0.90032521,BERK-318611,,2013927.jpg,Bronze Age object: Miniature axehead,Oxfordshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013927.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/460731.jpg

The blade is rounded and asymmetrical and narrows moderately to meet the shaft; it is fairly sharp with no signs of impact damage. The shaft sides are slightly convex and fairly parallel. There are slight flanges visible on both faces of the axe along the edges of the shaft running from the base of the blade and reaching almost to the butt. The butt is rounded and quite sharp. There is a slight stop-ridge visible on one face. The blade is lenticular through its length, and, aside from the flanges, fairly flat across its width.



It would appear that, except for the effects of corrosion, the axe is largely intact. The asymmetrical blade may be the result of major re-sharpening after damage in antiquity.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,110.2,,,10.2,90.37,1,Roland Flook,Roland Flook,,Gwynedd,,,SH5668,,53.18953941,-4.15670502,GAT-319515,,PAS2013_24_007_white 001.jpg,Bronze Age Flat Axe (face view),Gwynedd Archaeological Trust ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rflook/PAS2013_24_007_white 001.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/460693.jpg

607049,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1600,-400,"An unidentified cast copper-alloy object, a 'moustache' mount, so named because of its shape being reminiscent of a moustache. The object is cast in one piece and has a swollen body which tapers towards the pointed terminals. The centre of the body is narrowed and has a uniform vertical groove running around its girth to the underside or base of the object. At this point the grooves ends and abutts a circular recess, approximately 7.3 mm in diameter. All sides of the object are decorated with alternating ridges and grooves arranged horizontally. The narrowed terminals are without the ribbed decoration and corrosion has effected the very ends. With an undecorated end, some of these objects are reminiscent of hedgehogs.



A number of objects of this type have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database, however this is the largest example so far recorded. A similar object was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and as such they are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example. Their function is uncertain, although a circular recess at the bottom of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. A mount for a sword or dagger handle is the most obvious function but the absence of evidence makes this conjectural.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,34.7,,,12.8,58.53,1,Anni Byard,Anni Byard,South East,West Berkshire,West Berkshire,Boxford,SU4374,From a paper map,51.46334615,-1.38241981,BERK-719DA8,,2013951.jpg,Bronze Age object: 'Moustache' mount,Oxfordshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2013951.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/461130.jpg
607149,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-750,"A late Bronze Age, cast copper alloy, socketed axehead decorated with skeuemorphic wings, probably a South Eastern type, probably of the Wilburton to Ewart Park traditions, dating from about 1100 - 750 BC, Needham period 6-7, which corresponds to metalworking stages X-XII.



The axehead is wedge shaped with a sub-circular socket at the haft end that has a double mouth moulding running round it; a prominent bulbous moulding forming the rim (wide and D shaped in section), and a much less well defined lower collar. A lumpy area on the back of this rim may be the remains of a casting jet. The body is rectangular in section, tapering towards the cutting edge where it flares outwards towards the tips of a slightly curved blade. The sides of the axe are slightly hollow where they curve out to the tip of the blade. There is no obvious blade bevel. The blade edge is slightly chipped and measures 50mm in width across the tips.



On one side of the mouth, projecting from the lower collar, is a D shaped attachment loop. It is 11.4mm wide and 25mm long, starting 15mm from the end of the axe. It is a pointed oval in section. Casting flashes remain on both edges of the axe, including the loop. They seem to have been trimmed, but are only smoothed flat near the blade. The axehead has a smooth, dark green patina. The socket was filled with soil when reported. Careful removal of the soil revealed the socket to be 84mm deep, and longitudinal ridges along the inside of the cavity, in the centre of the front and back faces of the axe.



The axe is decorated with faint mouldings on the front and back forming a ""moulded wing"" design. The front (when viewed with the loop at the top and to the right) has a central rib along the top half of the axe. This is flanked by a curved rib on each side which enclose a recessed shape of a rectangle with concave long sides. The ""back"" of the axe has a similar moulding, but instead of the central rib is a short chevron near the mouth, inside the curved ribs and pointing towards the cutting edge, and a more clearly defined ridge across the middle of the axe closing the rectangle with concave long edges. The top edge of the rectangle is the lower mouth moulding.



Some axes in Schmidt and Burgess have similar moulded decoration; specifically number 1280, plate 85, from York, 1287 from Heathery Burn, and also 1270 from Westow, East Yorkshire. Similar axes are more common in the South.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-02-07T00:00:00Z,2014-02-06T00:00:00Z,,,309,,,41.5,113.8,1,Peter Reavill,Jack Coulthard,Yorkshire and the Humber,Wakefield,Wakefield,Castleford Central and Glasshoughton,SE4625,GPS (from the finder),53.7193904,-1.30441382,SWYOR-816E11,,PAS_2309_axe1.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2309_axe1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/465589.jpg

The main body of the spear survives but the tip and part of the blade are missing. The hollow circular socket is triangular in plan and tapers to a raised central ridges from which the blades extend to both sides. Though incomplete the blade appears to have been leaf-shaped in plan with a pointed oval section. There are two worn holes on both blades to either side of the central spines where it meets the shaft. These basal loops are indicative of spearheads of the Taunton and Penard phases, 1400 â 1125 BC (Davis, 2017), and this type corresponds with Davis Group 8.



There is a break between the blade and the socket shaft which has been glued back together post-excavation by the finder.



The object has a mid grey-green patina. It is 124.62mm long and 35.34mm wide. The socket shaft is 63.77mm long and the blade is 59.94mm long. The central ridge is 12.05mm wide and the blade is only 1.80mm thick. It weighs 94g.

There are traces of a slight raised rib on the butt end of both sides. The surviving portion of the body is rectangular in cross-section with a hole in the centre, which is all that remains of the socket. All surfaces have a shiny green patina, which is missing in a few places. Traces of patination can also been found on the break.

Cast U-shaped plate with a cutting edge which runs along one long edge and continuing along the short straight side; the other long side and the U shaped end are flattened. The section is of extremely flattened lentoid form, a point which is only apparent if it is viewed against a straight edge.This object was initially considered as a sword blade fragment, but it lacks any convincing strengthening of the middle part of the blade, and a single sided form would be unusual for a rapier. This object appears to have been robustly cleaned by the finder. Suggested date: possibly Late Bronze Age, 1000-800.

610211,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Bronze Age date (1150 - 800 BC) socketed axe: The copper alloy axe is a sub-trapezoid in plan. The mouth of the axe is sub square in plan with rounded corners, and on the mouth there is evidence of two casting jets, one on each side edge. The mouth, on the outer faces appears to be semi-circular in section and is slightly wider than the body of the axe itself. The surface of the socket is rough and is encrusted. There are also traces of what may be the casting residue. In profile the axe is triangular with a casting seam visible on both sides. There are no traces of a side loop. The body faces are undecorated and are trapezoidal in plan. The cutting edge is slightly convex, but it has the remains of the casting seam along it. The surface of the axe has traces of active corrosion, pitting and a well developed patina, but the majority of the surface is abraded and perhaps over cleaned revealing traces of fresh metal. It measures 57.76mm long, 36.32mm wide, 33.79mm thick and weighs 110.2g. The depth of the socket is 40.96mm deep.



Peter Reavill and Phil Watson comment the mouth of the axe is unusually wide, and that the shape is oddly 'stubby'. The blade has never been sharpened, and that in combination with the shape suggests it may have been made for use as a votive offering rather than a functional axe. It is probably dated to the late Bronze Age.

613593,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 15.3 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (11.5 mm), with traces of a proto stop ridge present. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



It measures 79.4 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.2 mm, width at the butt is 15.3 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 11.5 mm. It weighs 88.2 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

There are evident layers in section but these have been heat welded together by forging the gold when hot. The fragment has been hammered to thin out the piece at one end and then either snapped or chiselled off in two areas, perhaps to make it into a more rectangular shape, before it was reworked. There are patches of reddish patina, which have also been seen on a strip of gold (2014 T39) that has already undergone X-ray fluorescence analysis, at the British Museum, which indicated a surface composition of 86-88% gold, 11-13% silver and less than 1% copper which is most consistent with a Bronze Age attribution (report by Susan La Niece).



There are also similar hammered bar fragments that have been found in Bronze Age hoards such as the hoard from Cirencester, Gloucestershire (2004 T416) illustrated in the Treasure Annual Report 2004 on pages 232-3, Fig.17.3 & 17.5 and dated on page 26 to c.1300-1100 BC.

The palstave weighs 459.73g in its present condition. It has a length of 155.0mm, width of 25.1mm that increases to the maximum (but incomplete due to damage) width across the flaring blade of 64.0mm and maximum thickness of 25.8mm. See blue lines on the annotated image.



The artefact has a single shield shaped decoration positioned below the fused stop, and a subtle lateral single mid-rib below the shield. The cast side flanges are fused to the stop ridge and do not continue beyond the stop ridge. The blade is a crescentic or splayed fan shape. Some of these features are obscured from view by the presence of a concretion product that is present within the depressed areas to either side of and also covering the stop. See yellow dashed lines on the annotated image. Use wear is present on the blade.



Discussion: This form of axe fits into the primary, or early phase, palstaves being specifically of group III c.1500-1300 BC, which corresponds with Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - and with Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.

616207,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age gold bracelet fragment, 45 mm long 11mm wide and 1mm thick. The object is in fair condition and weighs 13.95 grams. The object consists of a solid sub-circular terminal 9.5mm long and 8mm wide. Below this the object has a rectangular form which widens and flattens sharply out to a terminal which appears to have been broken, as though ripped. The fragment begins with a width of 8mm and widens and flattens to 11mm where it has broken. The underside of the shaft is concave, which is most pronounced near the terminal and its upper side remains slightly rounded.



Discussion: The object is very similar to NMGW-E48854 and PAS-B9D6E5 both dated to the Late Bronze Age. Similar bracelets, and their wider context, are discussed by Eogan (1994, 80-108).","As the object is made of gold and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.

616493,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Cast copper alloy blade from a flat axe, trapezoidal in plan with a splayed crescent-shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges, and in section, at the broken butt end, it is rectangular. The blade is flaring to the edge and the blade facet is bevelled from hammering. The long side-edges of the axe are slightly flanged. The broken edge would have continued to taper towards the butt end. The blade edge is uneven with perpendicular nicks across the edge which show that it was used in antiquity. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, and the surface is not very corroded or pitted, with a few marks and strikes such as a linear shallow groove on one side, caused by damage prior to deposition (Laura Ratcliffe pers comm). There is also a circular depression that has been caused by a gas bubble forming when the axe was cast.



The length is 64 mm, the width of broken end is 39 mm and the width of the blade is 66 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 9.5 mm and the thickness of the blade edge is 4 mm.



Similar flat axes on the database can be seen in DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-3324F7, LANCUM-6507C2 and LVPL-851560.



Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe on page 400, Plate 1, No.6, from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall, and broad Migdale type flat axes from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall and Hemyock and Kentisbeare in Devon, on pages 418, 443 & 446, Plates 12, 31 & 33, Nos.98c, 243 & 259, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

618095,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle or Late Bronze Age date (1500 - 800 BC) socketed spear (spearhead): The copper alloy spearhead consists of the upper portion of the spear, being broken just as the socket starts. In plan the spearhead is an elongated sub-triangle with the blade facets and tip both being abraded. The spear blades cutting edges have been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is oval. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has a light grey/green coloured patina which is incomplete. It measures 50.08mm long, 13.47mm wide, 5.66mm thick and weighs 8.8g.



It is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-10-24T23:00:00Z,2013-12-02T00:00:00Z,,,8.8,,,5.66,50.08,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Bromsgrove,Dodford with Grafton,SO9471,From finder,52.33704904,-2.08948263,WAW-F10D36,,WAW-F10D36.jpg,"Middle or Late Bronze Age socketed spearhead (plan, profile and reverse).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-F10D36.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/469681.jpg

It measures 113.90mm in length, 27.82mm in max.width (across the base of the blade), 23.13mm in max.thickness and diameter (at the open end of the socket) and with a socket depth at least 87mm.

The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade, measuring 14.79mm in thickness at its widest point (27.82mm) and extending from just above the two peg-holes (one of which is 4.9mm in diameter, the other 3.9mm). The blade has a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib (extending from a conical socket). It is unclear how far beyond the depth of at least 87mm the socket extends as traces of wood are apparent in the socket. The line of the blade is smoothly curving and angles a little more sharply at the tip. Peter Reavill (FLO, Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments that this example is on the cusp of being 'stumpy', which Ehrenburg defines as being less than 100mm in length and having a width 1/3 their length (pers.comm.

1. A fragment from the mouth of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe head with a shallow and not well defined moulding at the rim and broken across a second shallow moulding. The breaks are irregular and unabraded but not recent. Now separate, but within socket of another axe (No. 4) when found. It has not been possible to assign the axe to a typological grouping.



Dimensions: Surviving length: 15mm; Surviving width: 18mm; Weight: 6.4g.



2. A fragment of cast, curved copper alloy Late Bronze Age socketed axe head with no original edge, the breaks irregular and unabraded but not recent. Now separate, but within socket of axe 4 when found. It has not been possible to assign the axe to a typological grouping.



Dimensions: 15mm by 18mm; Weight 4.1g.



3. A fragment from the mouth of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe head with a shallow moulding at the rim and broken across a second shallow moulding. The breaks are irregular and unabraded but not recent. Now separate, but within socket of axe 4 when found. It has not been possible to assign the axe to a typological grouping.



Dimensions: Surviving length: 15mm; Surviving width: 21mm; Weight: 6.2g.



4. An incomplete Late Bronze Age socketed axe head, broken and distorted. The sides originally straight or very slightly concave but now distorted, with an oval-sectioned loop, and narrow but distinct casting seams on each edge. The mouth and blade are missing, the breaks irregular and slightly corroded, with both faces apparently hammered at either end to pinch the broken edges towards each other. The surface is mostly patinated mid green, with patches of very pale dusty green corrosion. Object Nos. 1 - 3 were found within the socket of this axe head.



Dimensions: Surviving length 63 mm. Surviving width at break at blade end: 33mm. Maximum surviving thickness: 22mm.



5. A fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe head consisting of the curved blade only, broken across the base of the socket. The surface is corroded dull pale green with very worn breaks. It is not possible to be certain because of the condition of the breaks, but it seems unlikely that fragment Nos. 4 & 5 are parts of the same object.



Dimensions: Surviving length 24mm. Width of cutting edge 38mm. Weight 23.5g.



6. A fragment of an unidentified object. Sub-rectangular, flat-sectioned and thickened at one end. The edges and surface are extremely worn making it uncertain if the edges are broken or original except at the thinner, short edge which is probably a break. Perhaps part of a blade.



Dimensions: Length 35mm. Width 22.5mm. Maximum thickness 7mm. Weight 19.6g.



Discussion



The small area from which these objects were recovered and the presence of fragments within the socket of axe head No. 4 clearly suggests that these objects were deposited together as a hoard of prehistoric metalwork. The finds appear to represent a hoard of Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800/700 cal BC) metal in a fragmentary condition, often referred to as a 'founders' hoard'. It is not been possible to assign the axes to more particular typological grouping because of their fragmentary condition but it may be possible to do so in the course of future study.","Conclusions



The objects (No. 1-6) represent a single find of prehistoric base metal. The find therefore qualifies as belonging to a grouping of at least two prehistoric base-metal objects and, therefore, as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2014-03-01T00:00:00Z,2014-03-30T23:00:00Z,2014T364,,,,,,,6,Erica Darch,Erica Darch,Eastern,Norfolk,South Norfolk,Runhall,TG0608,Generated from computer mapping software,52.63064311,1.04251108,NMS-7517F1,,59739_7517F1_BA_Hoard_1and4.jpg,Bronze Age axe head,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edarch/59739_7517F1_BA_Hoard_1and4.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/470325.jpg

The handle of the axe is no longer present due to a break.

These extend towards the blade and stop just beyond the termination of the side flanges. The blade flattens and widens from the ridges to a maximum width of 64.84 mm. There is a little bit of damage to one side of the blade tip.

The axehead is incomplete and broken into two pieces, with loss due to the break.



The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly convex expanding sides and a very slightly curved cutting edge. In profile the blade is triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The break, which occurs just above the stop ridge, is H-shaped in cross-section and measures 26.18x18.15mm.


The butt-end of the axehead is sub-rectangular in plan, tapering towards the butt, and sub-triangular in profile. On both faces, high flanges rise to form the stop ridge (max.19.21mm high). Between these flanges is a vey thin septum, on one face of which is a small lump of metal, probably a product of corrosion.



The palstave retains some of its original smooth dark patina but the majority of the surface is corroded and now a bright green colour with some patches of red-brown. At the break, in both halves, air bubbles are visible in the metal, perhaps weakening it at this point.


With the two pieces fitted together the axehead measures 147.75mm in length. At the widest point, the cutting edge, it measures 47.48mm and at the thickest, the stop ridge, it measures 24.1mm. It weighs 306g.

Peter Reavill (FLO, Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments that it is interesting to note the rich dark patina on one face and abrasion corrosion on the upper which suggests that it was placed below the plough soil or at the junction between the natural and the plough zone. The tip is deliberately bent - most likely in antiquity as there doesn't seem to be loss of patina on the bend - which there would be if it were more recent.

628395,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"This is a complete and small penannular ring (or 'hair-ring') decorated with gold foil and a silvery gold inlayed strip. It appears that the gold foil was wrapped around a copper core, and around this, in continuous spiral fashion a silvery gold strip was inlayed, to provide a striped colour effect. The stripes are wide, with four silvery gold inlayed stripes and five gold foil stripes evident around the ring. The terminals are flat-ended and not expanded, 1.3mm apart on the interior side and 2.7mm apart on the exterior side. Careful examination of the terminals shows the folded over gold foil, slightly detaching from the core beneath. In addition, a small piece of gold foil has also slightly detached from the interior surface, opposite the terminals. Slight compression tension lines, at right angles to the ring in plan, are evident in the surface on the interior face, suggesting that the ring may have been formed after the gold foil had been applied to a straight circular-sectioned copper rod. On one outer surface, there is an area of damage (6mm long by 3mm wide), where the gold foil and silvery gold strip are missing, revealing the exposed green copper core beneath. The surface of the silvery gold strip is noticeably more pitted than the gold foil. There are small nicks and scratches over the whole surface of the ring.","Discussion (by Adam Gwilt)



This penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple 'hair-rings' of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, 'hair-rings' have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal BC and 1373-1019 cal BC respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8 ). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).



'Hair-rings' are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O'Connor et al 2008; DCMS 2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (EluÃ¨re 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O'Connor et al 2008). This is the sixth known example from Wales, with examples known from Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, 'Carmarthenshire', Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 & 15).



The complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 & Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.



A search of the Heritage Environment Record for the locality did not reveal any known archaeological sites or contemporary artefacts finds within the field where the find was made. However, an Early Bronze Age cemetery is known at Somerset Farm Northwest, a few hundred metres from the find spot (PRN Nos. 00412s; 00413s; 03824s). An undated, but probably Medieval to post-Medieval holy well with two foci (PRN Nos. 03720s; 03721s) and linked to a watercourse and nearby Medieval chapel (PRN 00422s) is also known within a few hundred metres of the find. An undated burial is also known to have been found in the vicinity of the chapel in 1861 (PRN No. 00414s). While not directly contemporary with the penannular ring, an earlier burial focus could possibly have influenced the location of this find and burial context. Though the holy well is much later in date, the spring head and watercourse could also have been a significant landscape location during the Middle to Late Bronze Age.

628420,Votive Model,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1000,-500,"A complete Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age copper alloy Votive Model of a miniature wheel dated to c. 1000-500 BC. The wheel is circular in plan with a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate before joining the outer rim. The rim of the wheel and the spokes are rectangular in cross section. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle which appears to have been drilled. The upper surface of the model is covered with striations in one direction which appear to have been creating by an abrasive surface. The reverse of the modle is not decorated.



The model is 21.8mm in diameter, 1.9mm thick and weighs 2.50 grams.



On the record for HESH-C53CF4, which is very similar to this example, Peter Reavill writes:



""This form of artefact is relatively rare and the PAS has only recorded one other example from Thimbleby, Lincolnshire (DENO-0BBA52). Images of this artefact were sent to Dr Adam Gwilt at NGMW, Cardiff. Dr Gwilt suggested that similar comparable artefacts had been recorded in the late Bronze Age / Early Iron Age assemblage from the votive site at Flag Fen, Peterborough, amongst the Iron Age Salisbury hoard, and also the Hounslow Hoard.

1. South Wales Type ribbed socketed axe 



Dimensions: length 98.1mm; blade width 56.1mm; external mouth dimensions 50.1 by 39.6mm; internal mouth dimensions 32.1 by 25.6mm; depth of socket approx. 64mm; width body below loop 36.7mm; dimensions projecting runner stubs (1) 7.9 by 2.3mm; height 0.5mm; (2) 8.6 by2.8mm; height 0.1mm; (3) 7.7 by 2.6mm; height 0.1mm; dimensions negative runner scar (4) 6.4 by 2.7mm; weight 270.0g



A complete bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides with splaying of the blade edge. The loop is high and narrow, descending from the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the runners spaced approximately 90 degrees apart, although slightly offset, rather than centrally placed along each side. Three of the runners are projecting stubs, while the other is visible as a negative scar. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are oval in plan. Three longitudinal, prominent and convergent ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. On the outer non-loop side there is a slight mismatch in the mould pairing, one side of the mould slightly wider than the other. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. Striations parallel with the curved blade edge indicate it was sharpened for use. Patches of blue corrosion products on both faces suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. The axe has large areas of black patination on the upper surfaces, while the blade end and bevel has a grey-green patination



2. South Wales Type ribbed socketed axe



Dimensions: length 101.5mm; blade width 55.8mm; external mouth dimensions 51.0 by 41.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 33.9 by 28.5mm; depth of socket approx. 74mm; width body below loop 38.9mm; dimensions projecting runner stubs (1) 8.4 by 4.7mm; height 0.3mm; (2) 7.8 by 4.3mm; height 0.2mm; (3) 9.3 by 4.9mm; height 3.0mm; (4) 10.5 by 4.0mm; height 1.5mm; weight 314.6g.



A complete bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has straight and slightly divergent sides with pronounced splaying and recurving of the blade edge. The loop is high and narrow, descending from the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the runners approximately 90 degrees apart. All four runners are projecting stubs. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are oval in plan. Three longitudinal and slightly convergent ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face and the face sides are defined and angular. The ribs are not continuous or well defined, suggesting the axe was cast in a re-used stone mould. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. There is a slight casting flaw, indicated by a projecting linear ridge extending from the underside of the loop on the side surface of the axe. Hammer facets are visible on the upper blade bevel, while striations parallel with the markedly curved blade edge, indicating that the axe was prepared and sharpened for use. On the upper blade surfaces, the axe has a black patination, while at the blade end, the axe has a grey-green patination, with an area of bronze metal showing through on one blade bevel. A small organic sample, possibly remnant wood, was retrieved from the socket of the axe, when the soil was removed from the axe's socket in the archaeological conservation laboratory (MD).



3. South Wales Type ribbed socketed axe (found associated with blade fragment 9)



Dimensions: length 105.1mm; blade width 53.1mm; external mouth dimensions 54.6 by 45.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 36.0 by 32.2mm; depth of socket approx. 75mm; width body below loop 41.3mm; dimensions of projecting runner stubs (1) 9.3 by 3.7mm; height 1.0mm; (2) 7.8 by 2.9mm; height 0.1mm; weight 311.0g.



A complete bronze socketed axe with damage and splitting of the mouth and down the non loop side, with further slight cracking on the mouth. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has near straight and slightly divergent sides with little splaying at the blade end. The loop is high and narrow, descending from the mouth moulding. Two projecting runner stubs are visible at 90 degree angles from each other, suggesting the axe had a four runner casting technology, even though two of the runners are no longer visible. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in plan. Three longitudinal and slightly convergent ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. The ribs are discontinuous on one face, suggesting the axe was cast in a re-used stone mould. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. Some mismatching of the mould halves is evident, with the sides of the loop misaligned and also a misalignment down the non-loop side of the axe, making one side stand proud of the other. In two places immediately below the mouth moulding, and in one place on an upper face, there are small holes in the axe wall, indicating further casting imperfections. Hammer facets are visible on the upper blade bevel on one side, while striations on both sides parallel with the blade edge indicate that the axe was sharpened for use. The axe has a grey-green patination, except on the blade bevels which have a lighter green patination.



4. South Wales Variant Type ribbed socketed axe



Dimensions: length 93.7mm; surviving blade width 40.2mm; external mouth dimensions 39.8 by 31.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 27.5 by 20.5mm; depth of socket approx. 67mm; width body below loop 32.1mm; weight 223.1g.



A near complete slender, bronze socketed axe, with damage to part of the blade edge. The axe has a deep mouth moulding, verging on a collar, and a sub-rectangular cross-section. The axe has near straight but slightly divergent sides with only very slight splaying at the blade end. The loop is narrow, but low, descending from the underside of the mouth moulding. There are no runner stubs or scars around the mouth. Small amounts of projecting excess metal are found around the inner rim of the mouth and at the joining points between the outer mould pairing. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in plan. Three longitudinal and parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. These are prominent and well-defined. The casting seams are narrow, projecting and blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. The surfaces have a few small vesicles or hollows on upper faces, slight surface casting imperfections. There are striations on the blade bevels running parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened for use. The axe has a grey green patination, with bronze metal showing though on one lower face, blade bevels and on the ribs. A small organic sample, possibly remnant wood, was retrieved from the socket of the axe, when the soil was removed from the axe's socket in the archaeological conservation laboratory (MD).



5. Croxton Type ribbed socketed axe (fragment 11 is wedged in the axe socket)



Dimensions: surviving length 103.7mm; blade width 54.9mm; external mouth dimensions 48.2 by 41.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 32.8 by 28.3mm; depth of socket approx. 76mm; width body below loop 41.5mm; combined weight (with fragment 11) 303.2g.



A near complete bronze socketed axe, with a damaged blade edge. The axe has a deep and near flat, onset collar, with no marked flaring of the mouth. The axe is oval in cross section with rounded face edges. The axe has straight and slightly divergent sides, before flaring outwards at the deep blade bevel, though without any recurving of the blade edge. The loop is relatively wide and placed low, descending from the underside of the deep collar. Projecting, but possibly filed down, metal excess is found around the inner rim of the mouth and at the joining points between the mould halves. There are no runner stubs or scars around the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are oval in plan. Three longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the underside of the collar. The casting seams are prominent but blunted, suggesting hammering or partial filing of the excess after casting. There are small vesicles in the surface on one face and on one side of the mouth rim of the axe, which are slight surface casting imperfections. On one face, hammer marks are visible on the upper blade bevel. Striations parallel to the blade edge indicate that this axe was sharpened for use. The axe has a light grey green patination on one side, grading to a darker grey green on the other. Immediately beneath the onset collar, on one face, is a small patch of blue surface corrosion product, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. At the base of the socket of the axe, is wedged a mouth fragment of another socketed axe (number 11, below), preventing an accurate weight for this complete axe to be established.



6. Croxton Type ribbed socketed axe (fragment 10 is wedged in the axe socket)



Dimensions: length 116.8mm; blade width 51.5mm; external mouth dimensions 45.4 by 38.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 34.6 by 28.1mm; depth of socket approx. 73mm; width body below loop 40.3mm; dimensions of projecting runner stub 10.9 by 3.4mm, height 1mm; combined weight (with fragment 10) 434.2g.



A complete slender and heavy bronze socketed axe with slight damage to one side of the blade edge. The axe has a deep but ill-defined collar, with no marked flaring at the mouth. The axe is sub-rectangular to hexagonal in cross-section with rounded face edges. There is slight angling and narrowing from the side casting-seams to the face edges, giving a slightly hexagonal cross-section to the axe. The axe has slightly concave sides, diverging and flaring slightly towards the blade end. Although there is no marked recurving of the blade edge, the blade bevel flares outward slightly. The loop is relatively wide and placed low, descending from the underside of the deep but ill-defined collar. Around the inner rim of the mouth and at the joining points between the mould halves, there is slight excess projecting metal, which does not look to have been filed or hammered down. A distinct widening of excess metal on an inner face may indicate the location of a single visible runner stub. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in form. Three longitudinal ribs descend down both faces of the axe. Unusually, the ribs project above the collar edge and into the lower collar zone, rather than emerging from the underside of the collar. On one face the three ribs are slightly convergent down the blade face, but on the other face there is a convex form with 'bulging' outwards in the middle areas of the ribs. The casting seams are prominent but blunted, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. Hammer marks and longitudinal striations are visible on the upper blade surfaces, while the blade bevels have striations parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the blade was prepared and sharpened for use. On one face edge, on the non-loop side, there are repeated blunt dent marks 2-3mm long and 10.5-1mm wide, in parallel sequence and at right angles to the side of the axe. A few further and similar dent marks are visible cross-cutting through the descending ribs on the same axe face. The axe has a dark grey patination on the mouth and upper end, while bronze metal is revealed over most areas of the lower and blade end. At the base of the socket of the axe, is wedged a side and face fragment from a mid-section of another socketed axe (number 10 below), preventing an accurate weight for this complete axe to be established.



7. Breiddin Type (Southern English ribbed - Class B4 / Welby Type) ribbed socketed axe



Dimensions: length 84.6mm; blade width 45.4mm; external mouth dimensions 39.5 by 37.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 28.2 by25.5mm; depth of socket approx. 67mm; width body below loop 30.1mm; weight 168.4g.



A complete small and slender bronze socketed axe with a swollen and everted mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped cross-section. The sides of the axe are straight but divergent with significant widening and recurving at the blade end. The loop is wide and low placed, descending from a lower horizontal moulding. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in form and the mouth is almost as deep as it is wide. The rim of the mouth is rounded and worn, with no clear runner stubs identifiable. Three longitudinal ribs descend from the underside of the mouth moulding, around one third of the length of each face. The ribs, like the mouth moulding are poorly defined and are narrowly spaced. On one face the ribs are parallel, while on the other, they are slightly divergent. The casting seams, though visible, appear to have been carefully and neatly hammered or filed down. On the loop side, around the upper point of insertion of the loop, there is a curving hole in the axe wall, around 13-14mm long and 3-4mm wide, indicating a casting flaw. The upper blade bevel has been heavily hammered, with hammer marks creating marked flattening and tapering. Striations both parallel with the blade edge and at right angles to the blade indicate that the axe was sharpened for use. The blade edge is markedly deep and curved, with slight damage on the loop side. The blade edge is asymmetric in shape, with lower and more pronounced recurving on the loop side, suggesting long-usage and repeated re-working and sharpening of the blade. Overall, the axe has a grey green patination, although on the upper blade and mouth end, there are patches of black patination, while on the blade bevel, the patina is light grey-green. On one face and the loop side are areas of green and dark blue concretions, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial.



8. Late Palstave of Type Isleham -ribbed form



Dimensions: surviving length 145.2mm; surviving blade width 37.8mm; surviving blade length approx. 82mm; surviving length of butt to stop approx. 59mm; width of butt at break 21.8mm; body width below loop 22.0mm; maximum thickness at stop 32.1mm; stop heights (1) approx.11mm; (2) approx. 10mm; surviving weight 354.7g.



A near complete, slender bronze palstave with a narrow blade. The palstave has a broken butt end and damage to the blade edge. The palstave widens very slightly from the butt end towards the stop, with a nipped-in waist under the stop. The blade sides are slightly concave and divergent, with slight flaring at the blade edge but no recurving of the blade evident. The stop is sub-rectangular and high, projecting in exaggerated fashion at near right angles to the axis in side view. On one face, there is a slight casting flaw where the stop does not project to full height. This shows as a central 'stepped shallowing' of the stop along a 10mm length, and by approximately 2-3mm in height. The flanges are convex in shape, meeting the septum approximately 17mm from the broken butt end. Descending from the stop on each face are three longitudinal and parallel ribs. These are short, extending only 20-22mm down the upper blade faces. Unusually, on each septum surface, there are also two longitudinal and parallel ribs, running parallel with the long axis. These extend from the stop approximately 43mm on one face, and approximately 31mm on the other, before being concealed by a corrosion patch. The casting flashes appear to have been carefully trimmed. Along each side, at the blade end, and below the waisting, slight faceting is visible either side of the central casting seam, 2.5-3.5mm from, and running parallel with the face edges. The loop is broad, one arm above and the other below the level of the stop. Four facets have been shaped onto this, parallel with the loop axis, giving a wide central face, with one wide, then one narrow facet to either side. There are striations running parallel to the blade edges, indicating that the palstave was sharpened for use. The palstave has a dark grey green patina over most areas, with a light grey-green blade bevel and small areas of light green corrosion on the stop, flange and butt end. On one upper blade face and septum, there are areas of green and dark blue concretion, suggesting that the palstave may have been burnt immediately before burial. The break on the butt of the palstave is not corroded but appears evenly covered with soil, suggesting the damage does not relate to the removal of the object from the ground, but may have occurred when a plough clipped the top of the implement at some time during the post-medieval period.



9. Socketed axe blade fragment - not diagnostic (associated with socketed axe 3)



Dimensions: surviving length 42.0mm; blade width 54.8mm; width at break 49.6mm; thickness at break 15.1mm; distance base of socket to blade edge 29.5mm; surviving depth of socket 12.5mm; surviving weight 109.5g.



Blade end fragment of a bronze socketed axe. The sides of the axe are divergent, with almost no flaring at the blade end and no recurving of the blade evident. The axes appears to have had a rectangular cross-section. The casting seams are prominent but blunted, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. There are striations, both parallel and at right angles to the blade edge, visible on the blade bevel suggesting it was sharpened for use. Slight indentations on the faces near to the break may be casting imperfections. The blade fragment has a grey patination, with areas of bronze showing through in places. Near the break and in the socket interior there are green corrosion patches, while on one face there are patches of dark blue corrosion, suggesting that this fragment may have been burnt immediately before burial.



10. Socketed axe side and mid blade face fragment - not diagnostic (wedged inside socketed axe number 6)



Dimensions: surviving length approximately 32mm; surviving thickness approx. 13mm; surviving width - less than 51mm; combined weight (with axe 6) 434.2g.



Side and face fragment from the mid section of a bronze socketed axe, securely wedged inside the socket of axe 6. The axe appears to have had a rectangular cross-section. The casting seam is prominent but blunted, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. It is not possible to determine whether the axe was plain or ribbed. The axe has a dark grey patination, with bronze showing on the casting seam and face edge.



11. Socketed axe mouth fragment - not diagnostic (wedged inside socketed axe number 5)



Dimensions: surviving length - less than 46mm; surviving width at mouth approx 23mm; surviving thickness at mouth approx. 13mm; combined weight (with axe 5) 303.2g.



Mouth, upper face and side fragment from a bronze socketed axe, securely wedged inside the socket of axe 5. The exterior outline of the mouth appears sub-rectangular, while the interior outline appears oval in shape. No runner stubs and no excess metal are visible on the surviving rim surface. It is not possible to determine whether the axe was plain or ribbed.

628788,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-950,-750,"A fragment of Late Bronze Age socketed axehead, consisting of the cutting edge only and broken just above the start of the socket. It measures 33.54mm in length, 51.46mm in max.width, 11.42mm in max.thickness and weighs 60.51g.

The cutting edge is expanded and relatively undamaged, with just some patination-loss at the very edge. The casting flash is not visible, and the side are faceted, giving an eight-sided cross-section at the break.

The patina is a shiny dark green in colour with fine scratches across the surface, some apparently recent damage and showing a silvery surface beneath.

The depth of the socket at the break is 2.14mm and the break measures 35.29x11.42mm. In profile, the fragment is triangular in shape.

The spearhead is largely complete, with a blade indicating a long uselife and a complete socket with only minor chipping around the edge. The entire head has been cast integral, with a conical socket retaining lozenge-shaped sideloops near the base of the socket. No flashmarks are visible.



The blade was originally 'leaf-shaped', with angular shoulders, but the blades on each side of the head have been repeatedly sharpened over the course of its life, reducing the size of the blade considerably. The socket extends into the base of the blade, with a well-defined rib emerging from the socket and running the length of the blade, with the rib also having been filed with the edges as the blade became reduced in size. The lower blade, near each shoulder probably also appears to have been resharpened.

632319,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1000,-600,"Fragment of a late Bronze Age copper alloy sword of Ewart Park-type (circa 1000-800 BC). The fragment comprises most of the handle. It has marginal ribs running down its edges and two circular perforations. One is filled with iron corrosion. This suggests that this fragment might be dated to the cusp between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (c. 600BC). The handle has an expanded, flared terminal, which tapers to a convex-sided grip. The blade-end of the handle is incomplete, but the 'break' is very neat and linear, and possibly suggests that it was intentionally cut in antiquity. The section of the break bears the same mid-green patina with patches of brown staining.



In section, the handle is 'H'-shaped, and when viewed from the side the lips of the 'H' widen towards the middle. The body of the handle thickens at this point also, and a circular rivet hole is located in the centre.



The surface of the object is smooth and has a mid-green patina with patches of brown staining. The sides of the flared terminal both have what appears to be a shallow ridge of casting running along the centre.

633173,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete and corroded Middle Bronze Age copper-alloy Group II palstave (1500-1300 BC). A copper alloy palstave with single mid rib and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On both faces of the blade there is a single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The surface of the blade has traces of hammer marks forming irregular lines across the wide blade facet. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion, but appears to be symmetrical. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam. There is a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. The flange sides are a sub triangle in profile with casting seams. One side, at the junction of the blade and stop there is an integral loop which is has a sub-lozenge section. The void is a sub semi-circle. In plan the septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, whose butt is rectangular with rounded corners. The surface of the palstave a dark brown/green patina which is incomplete and there is a patch of active corrosion at the butt on both faces. The palstave measures 148.82mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.53mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 32.11mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 337.2g.



The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group II type which has a mid rib decoration. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).



Peter Reavill comments that the palstave '...fits within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII and is likely to be part of the Acton Park II metalworking assemblage. This form is very common in the west mids and marches'.

633881,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1700,"A hoard of two Early Bronze Age flat axes, dating from about 2050 BC - 1700 BC, and found in the same hole. One axe is complete and the other is in two pieces and is decorated.



Descriptive catalogue:



1. A copper alloy flat axe which is in two parts; it seems likely that this object has broken while in the ground and the break is not an example of pre-depositional action. The surfaces of the break are covered with comparable patina to the other surfaces of the object and both pieces fit neatly together.



The upper portion of the blade has a damaged butt, which is now uneven with one corner broken off, creating a diagonal butt. The sides widen slightly towards the break, which is approximately halfway between the butt and the cutting-edge. The lower portion of the blade consists of the cutting-edge, which is worn and one blade tip, the other is missing due to old breaks. The rounded nature of the side with the missing blade tip possibly conveys that after the break, the blade was re-sharpened to create a new working cutting-edge.



One face of the axe is flatter than the other, which is slightly convex. One side of the axe is also noticeably thicker than the other, this feature alongside the broken blade tip are possible indicators of how the axe was hafted, with the narrower side forming the lower edge after hafting. One side has been hammered to create slight flanges; this is only visible on the flatter face as this surface is less corroded. This face also has discernible decoration, consisting of straight vertical punched lines ('Rain pattern') on both the upper and lower portions of the blade. It is possible that the other face and the sides of the axe may also have been decorated, however the evidence of this has been lost due to corrosion.



Overall the axe is corroded and is entirely covered with dark brown patina with areas of green and mounds and pits of copper alloy corrosion, particularly on one face.



Dimensions:  Max. Length: 106.8 mm, Width at cutting-edge: 51.8 mm, Width at butt: 19.0 mm, Max. Thickness: 10.4 mm; Weight: 172g.



2. A largely complete copper alloy flat axe. The butt is worn and appears to be slightly damaged; with one squared corner remaining. The sides in the upper half are almost parallel, widening gradually in the lower half to form a narrow cutting-edge. There is a slight stop-ridge across the thickest section of the blade, approximately halfway between the butt and the cutting-edge. The sides form slight flanges, creating dished faces.



Both blade tips are missing due to old breaks and the cutting-edge is very worn and corroded. Overall one face is less corroded than the other and both are covered with dark brown patina with small areas of green corrosion, particularly noticeable along the sides of the axe. All surfaces have mounds and pits of corrosion.



Dimensions: Max. Length: 192.2 mm, Max. Width at cutting-edge: 52.0 mm, Max. Width at butt: 23.3 mm, Max. Thickness: 11.9 mm; Weight: 242 g.



Discussion: 



Both the objects are corroded and missing several key diagnostic features, notably the butt and the blade tips of both objects but key diagnostic features are present, particularly the flanged sides and slight stop-ridge visible on flat axe No. 2. Both objects could be attributed to several possible types; Type Glenalla, Falkland or Bandon, these types are very similar and share common features (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61-68), although the size and the protruding blade tip of axe No.1 are consistent with Type Bandon. These types date to Stage IV or V of Needham's (1996) Metalwork Assemblage scheme (c.2050-1700 cal. BC) and are comparable to several axes found in a hoard of five axes from Wold Farm, Willerby, East Yorkshire, several of which are decorated (Burgess & Schmidt 1981, no. 326-8 & 337, pl. 134; Needham et al. 1985, BBAM Series A, no.5; Rohl & Needham 1998, fig.26, 125). The Silsden find falls within a group of Yorkshire flat axe hoards of MA IV/V noted by Needham (1988, fig. 2)



Additional information on context of discovery: 



In subsequent correspondence (between the 3rd and 4th of December 2014) regarding the relative positions of the axes, [the finder (name redacted)] noted that flat axe No. 1 was the first to be recovered, that the 'axes were deep' and that they 'were in direct contact [with] no space between them'. A sketch and description provided shows the two axes placed side by side but 'kind of overlapping', No. 1 over No. 2, with the blades facing in opposite directions.

Fragment of a late Bronze Age socketed axe. Approximatly one-third of the axe remains, with the surviving third being the blade-end. The blade is flared, and one bale tip survives. The blade narrows to a rectangular hollow shaft. The section of the shaft shares the same mid-brown patina as the exterior, suggesting that it was dismantled in antiquity. The section is smooth in most areas, and appears to have been cut rather than being broken. Small patches of copper corrosion are visible around the section, and at one of the blade tips.

636479,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-800,"A fragment of a copper alloy socketed spearhead dating from the Middle or Late Bronze Age, about 1550 â 800 BC. The object consists of the tip of the spearhead which has a pronounced central spine and a partial broken socket. The object also has partially retained wings which are missing large aspects and those retained are heavily abraded. An insufficient portion of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.



The metal is a dark green with a heavily pitted and corroded patina.

A similar example with a rectangular shape and circular socket has been recorded on the PAS database (LVPL-89D1D3). Most published examples have sockets that are the same shape as the object itself. The example on the database is Late Bronze Age in date, making it likely that this example is of a similar date.

It appears to be either a very late specimen belonging to the Penard metalwork assemblage of the late Middle Bronze Age (i.e. a transitional palstave) or, more likely, it was part of the Wilburton metalwork assemblage (earlier phase of the Late Bronze Age, i.e. a late palstave). The palstave is complete and the casting seams have been filed down. The length of the axe is 158mm and the internal length of the socket is 67mm. The width of the body below the stop ridge is 18.4mm.The palstave is complete, but has a very pitted, mottled green surface. It looks like it was cast and prepared for use as well as used and subsequently re-sharpened; there are striations towards the edge of the blade. On one side there is a number of scratches between the wings/flanges on the outer surface of the palstave. These may have come from hafting it, but as the scratches look fresh it is more likely that they were plough damage.

The spearhead fragment consists of a conical point, with a sub circular to sub rectangular cross section. The fragment is partially hollow, with the socket surviving to a depth of 14.2 mm. Longitudinal ridges are present on either edge; these are all that remain of the plough rolled blades. The spearhead tapers to a sharp point.



The spearhead fragment is a dark brown with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of most of the original surface detail and the finder has coated extant remains with a preservative substance.



From what remains of the fragmnet it is impossible to refine the dating of the piece, although given its small size it is most likely to date from the Middle Bronze Age period c. 1600-1200 BC.

It now measures 50.4mm in length, 16.25mm wide, 2.85mm thick and weighs 6.76 grams.



The blade is triangular in shape and lenticular in cross-section, with a broad flat midrib. It extends from a flat D-shaped butt-end with central notch (2.2mm thick and 14.65mm wide) to either side of the butt is a broadly triangular notch.



The blade narrows from 4.15mm wide and 1.15mm thick.



Originally this blade may have been a Group IV rapier, possibly of Type Appleby or Type Cornacarrow with an oblong butt, two side notches and - unusually - a single notch at the top. It may have broken and then reworked into a short dagger with triangular blade.

641509,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1001,"Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group III, Low Flanged, Broad Blade form and possibly of Sleaford variant type, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p136)[1].



The palstave is near-complete, missing the part of the loop and with peripheral damage and is comparatively small (at 127.6mm and with a weight of 243.0g). The butt is damaged but was likely to have been moderately straight (with a width of 21.6mm and a thickness of 6.3mm). The sides from the butt to the stop are near-parallel, gently convex (with a maximum width of 23.8mm). The loop is damaged and extends either side of the stop (with a length of 25.3mm, an internal length of 7mm, a surviving height of 8.7mm and a width of 7.1mm). The septum is rounded and the stops are comparatively flat across both their depths and lengths (with a width of 17.0mm and where the axe has a thickness of 27.7mm). The flanges have a larger degree of damage on one face (with a surviving maximum depth of 25mm and a maximum height of 10.3mm). The flanges are curved and end before the butt, reaching their maximum height before the stop. The casting seams are clearly discernible on both sides and have been finished by hammering. There is the suggestion of subtle nick or ridge at the top of the blade sides and the sides are curved, diverging more sharply towards the blade edge. There is faceting across the thicknesses of the blade. The blade edge has been lost, which was moderately curved and slightly expanded (with a blade width of 44.4mm). The faces are decorated with a trident motif and the edges of the faces are ridged. The midrib and ridged edges both continue as far as the blade facet, producing two concave panels on the faces. The surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright green corrosion. The surface has recently been coated in oil.



The palstave is suggested as being of Type Sleaford because of the characteristic panels created between the midrib and flange extensions, this example may be seen as a variant because of the trident decoration. Sleaford palstaves are seen as beginning early in the life of broad blade palstaves with an uncertain longevity (ibid.). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC.

The palstave is near-complete, with some peripheral damage to the blade, butt and flanges (with a length of 172mm and a weight of 445.3g). The butt (with a width of 21.8mm) is now corroded and of uncertain form. The flanges begin a little before the butt and were comparatively high (now damaged on one face), rising to their maximum height just behind the stop (with a maximum surviving height of 35.5mm). One of the flanges has an indentation, probably the result of a casting flaw. The septum (with a thickness of 7.3mm) is gently concave. The sides are straight and near-parallel, slightly divergent as far as the stop (where the palstave has a width of 25.8mm). The stops are near-straight and flat (with a height above the septum of (12.7mm and 12.2mm). The casting seams are discernible on the sides where the surface survives and have been neatly finished. To the front of the stops, the sides are concave and gradually increase in divergence to the blade. The blade is moderately expanded and the blade tips have been damaged (giving the blade a surviving width of 64.4mm). Both faces are decorated with the characteristic 'shield-pattern' (31mm long) defined by a depression and without a moulding. The faces are flat across their widths and most of the length, before curving to the blade but without a discernible blade facet. The surface has a dark brown patina with areas of dark-green surface loss.



The palstave may be seen as significant being of Acton Park type and found 2100m South East from[m1] the eponymous hoard (Savory 1980, no. 262, p 116)[2]. Acton Park palstaves are dated to 'Acton Park 1' with a suggested date in the 16th century BC (Needham 1996, p 133)[3], within Needham's (ibid.) Period 4.

A previous discovery of three objects from the same findspot was made in May 2006 and was declared Treasure (Treasure case 2006 T272). The objects from that hoard (an unlooped palstave and two palstave fragments) are consistent with the character of object No. 1. Given that the fragment was found at the same location it can be considered (on the balance of probabilities) to be an addendum to 2006 T272. The fragment is too small to be typologically diagnostic but, if accepted as an addendum to 2006 T272, it may be assigned to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC), specifically the Acton Park phase of c.1500-1400 BC based on the typo-chronology of the unlooped palstave from the earlier find.



Conclusion



This object represents an addendum to Treasure Case 2006 T272 and therefore qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002) by virtue of being part of a find of two or more base metal objects of prehistoric date from the same findspot.","Addendum to 2006 T272

The tip of the blade and some of the socket are missing. The breaks are patinated. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded leaf-shaped blade. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge. The spearhead measures 75.4mm length, has a maximum width of 17.8mm across the base of the blade, and maximum thickness of 13.6mm across the socket. The depth of the socket is 29mm. The spearhead weighs 25.08 grams. The sides of the blades have been much abraded in the soil, loosing most of their shape and also the cutting edges. However, the overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (base to tip) lozenge shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear and is best described as being conical in shape. At the surviving end of the socket it has a diameter of 13.2mm and a thickness of 1.4mm. The string loops are 11mm from the base of the blade and they are oval. The loop has a maximum length of 11mm, width 2.5mm, and thickness of 2.5mm. The internal diameter of the loop measures 3mm x 1.8mm. The cross section is lentoid. Both loops are filled to some extent with green corrosion products. These loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams on either edge of the spear have presumably been trimmed and hammered flat; they are barely visible. The spearhead is a dark green colour with a corroded and lumpy surface. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.

642936,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1800,"Early Bronze Age bronze blade fragment from a flat axe of uncertain type



The axe is represented by a blade fragment, broken across both its length and width (with a surviving length of 49.0mm, a surviving width of 44.8mm, a maximum surviving thickness of 6.2mm and a weight of 51.5g). The unbroken side is straight (for a length of 12mm) and is rounded across its thickness (with a maximum thickness of 4.5mm). The surviving blade tip is rounded and somewhat distorted, after which the surviving part of the blade edge is comparatively straight (42.9mm wide). Neither face has a discernible blade facet. One face is convex over its length, while the other is comparatively flat. All of the breakages occurred in antiquity and the fractures extend around the break. The damage on the axe may be consistent with deliberate damage. The surface has a dark-green patina.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The fragment shows no evidence of developed features and it is possible that the axe belongs to the earlier part of the sequence of tin-bronze axes, possibly of Type Migdale or Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1]. Axes of this date belong to Metalwork Assemblages III - IV, dated to c. 2200 - 1800BC.

The axe is fragmentary, broken at both ends but is likely to have been close to the butt (with a surviving length of 21.4mm and a weight of 17.1g). The butt end has some damage (with a width of 21mm and a thickness of 4.4mm). The sides are slightly divergent to the break (with a maximum width of 24.6mm and a thickness of 6.7mm - 7.3mm). There is the suggestion of a casting seam on one side, although little of the original surface survives. The flanges are beginning to develop above the septum but are shallow and corroded at the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 9.2mm with a height above the septum of 1.3mm). A small number of casting flaws are evident on the fragment. The surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright green surface loss and corrosion.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1] from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.

The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end (with a surviving length of 23.7mm and a weight of 18.4g). The butt end is rounded and thins to an edge (with a width of 20.5mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The sides are straight and slightly divergent to the break (with a maximum width of 24.1mm and a thickness of 7.5mm). The sides are convex across their thicknesses with no surviving evidence of the casting seams. The flanges begin at the butt and are slightly convex along the short length to the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 11.0mm with a height above the septum of 2.0mm). There is an angled step on the break which may possibly suggest a cut. The surface has a dark-green brown patina with some pitting and areas of bright green corrosion.

643045,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age sword blade fragment of uncertain type, probably of Late Bronze Age date, possibly of Wilburton or Ewart Park metalworking Industry of Needham's (1996)[1] Periods 4-5, dated to c. 1150 - 750BC.



The sword is fragmentary, represented by a blade fragment, broken at both ends in antiquity (with a surviving length of 22.3mm and a weight of 16.7g). The blade has a midrib (11mm wide and giving a maximum thickness of 8.0mm), flanked on each side by a concave section to the blade edge. The blade edges have been lost but the beginnings of the blade edge facets are evident on both sides (giving the blade a maximum surviving width of 30.0mm). The short blade fragment is flat across its length with no evidence of bending prior to breaking but there are battering scars on the midrib on both faces. The surface has a dark brown patina, preserved over much of the fragment with areas of bright green corrosion



The fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.

643047,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"I am very grateful to John Llywelyn Williams for the following description:



The axe has a mottled green and brownish yellow corroded surface and is most likely made of bronze. Its most notable feature is its small size - with a length from butt to cutting edge of 73.4mm. The axe is well made with a thin rounded butt and the body expanding to form a slightly asymmetric cutting edge with rounded terminations. The sides are rounded and there may be traces of very subdued side flanges - the abraded surfaces making it most difficult to confirm their presence. There is no stop bevel but a slight depressed concavity across the face of the body in a position a third from the butt end is more likely to be a casting imperfection rather than a constructive feature.



The small size of the axe and the uncertainty about the presence of side flanges makes it difficult to place within a classificatory scheme. Its shape has the features of a miniature Migdale type axe but in a preliminary survey of 24 complete axes of this type from Wales, the length of the group varies from 108mm in the smallest example (Swansea, Great Western Railway Station) to 180mm in the largest (Oxwich, Gower), with an average for the series of 142.2mm. An axe of comparable size is the example from Kelsterton, Connah's Quey, Flintshire, but this is classified as a Developed axe of type Aylesford, a group that could accomodate the present specimen if side flanges were to be confirmed. Migdale type axes belong to Early Bronze Age Period 2 (c 2200/2150 - 2050BC), and Aylesford type axes to Post Period 2 (c 2100 - 1050BC). 



The utilitarian use of such small, slender axes is an unknown but debatable issue. A function as a delicate wood working tool could be postulated, but equally compelling would be to claim it as a votive replica of a much larger example. Unfortunately the context is not known, viz the depth at which it was buried, its position and orientation, and whether it was deposited in a pit or in association with any other below ground feature. Diminutive battle axes in stone, and bronze socketed axes are known from later stages in the Mid and Late Bronze Age. 



No analytical study of its composition has been undertaken. Such a study using a non- destructive quantitative technique (XRF) or semi-quantitative (SEM) could be most informative. 



The surface is abraded and some surface detail may have been lost. It would also be advantageous if the object was to receive remedial conservation to stabilize further deterioration from active bronze disease.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,61.7,,,7.3,73.4,1,Roland Flook,Roland Flook,Wales,Gwynedd,Gwynedd,Bontnewydd,SH4659,Generated from computer mapping software,53.10590198,-4.3019175,GAT-FE6CD4,,PAS2014-20-001 013.jpg,Bronze Age Axe (side A),Gwynedd Archaeological Trust ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rflook/PAS2014-20-001 013.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/488438.jpg
643112,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-650,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe fragment of uncertain type



The axe fragment is a mouth fragment, probably from the unlooped side (with a surviving length of 35.4mm, a surviving width of 28.6mm, a surviving depth of 9.0mm and a weight of 19.0g). The top of the mouth (with a thickness of 5.4mm - 6.0mm) is corroded but a raised area is likely to represent the casting runner stub. The casting seam is evident running down the middle part of the side, from the runner stub and appears to have been prominent, possibly with minimal finishing. There is a weak collar discernible on the side (with a length of 16mm). Above the break, the casting seam is slightly raised and it is possible that it represents the remains of the top of a loop, although it would have been placed comparatively low in relation to the collar. The side fragment is near-straight, slightly concave. The interior of the axe is straight along its length and is curving to the faces on both ends (giving an internal width of approximately 20mm). The surface is heavily-corroded with a mid-brown patina.



The fragmentary nature and lack of diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Socketed axes generally date from the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1150 BC - 750BC) but may also be of the Llyn Fawr phase (c. 800 - 650BC).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,19,,,6,35.4,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Eardisley,SO2951,From finder,52.15269716,-3.03915768,NMGW-0D2364,,2013.42.2 jpg.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed axe fragment of uncertain type,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.42.2 jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/488533.jpg
643183,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Copper alloy single-runner casting jet of uncertain date



The casting jet comprises the reservoir and a single runner (with a height of 29.8mm and a weight of 20.9g). The reservoir is sub-oval (27.1mm x 21.8mm and 10.9mm deep). The top surface of the jet is as-cast, with a prominent bubble void at the side, near one end and the sides are smooth from the interior of the gate. The runner is of oval section, narrowing slightly towards the break (4.7mm x 3.7mm at the break, with a length of 16.4mm). The top part of the runner is more irregular, possibly suggesting a clay gate was employed.

The object is sub-rectangular in plan and gently widens towards the blade which has a maximum width of 36.05 mm although there is clear damage to the edge of the blade making it very blunt. There is some bevelling on both sides of the object caused by hammering the object. When viewed in profile the object is triangular, with the objects again tapering to a point at the blade. There are clear casting seams on both profiles and on one side there is the base of the loop which has probably broken in antiquity. The axe has a maximum thickness of 28.87 mm. The socket is sub-rectangular and there is damage to the edge with some light green, active corrosion. There is a groove which runs around the object, presumably parallel to the original edge of the socket.

643872,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Early Bronze Age bronze Flat Axe, possibly of Type Migdale (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44)[1], of Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.



The axe is incomplete, missing the butt and with peripheral damage (with a surviving length of 103.3mm and a weight of 264.2g). The break at the butt occurred in antiquity and there is the suggestion of bending towards one of the faces, prior to breaking. The axe is of rectangular section at the break (with a width of 26.4mm and a thickness of 8.3mm), which is flat and at a slight angle to the sides. The sides curve gently towards the blade for most of the length before curving more sharply at the blade. The blade tips are eroded (giving the blade a width of 60.8mm) and the blade edge is comparatively straight, now appearing to be angled although the original blade edge does not survive. The axe has a consistent rectangular section with no surviving evidence for developed features. Both faces are gently convex across their lengths before thinning at the blade.



Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe and was carried out[3] using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), with an Oxford Instruments Inca energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The results show the metal composition is a tin-bronze alloy (with mean readings of copper: 87.08% and tin: 12.27%), with a significant trace of antimony (with a mean reading of 1.25%) and nickel (with a mean reading of 0.24%), but no arsenic. The lack of arsenic as an impurity makes the alloy difficult to fit into Northover's (1980, p 229-243 )[4] Early Bronze Age metal groups but the comparatively high levels of Nickel may suggest that the alloy is closer to his 'G' metal.



The highly-corroded and incomplete state of the axe makes typological identification difficult. However, the lack of any surviving developed features and the simple, curved-sided form to the axe are suggestive of Type Migdale dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.

644185,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1700,"Early Bronze Age Developed flat axe, probably of Type Bandon, as defined Schmidt & Burgess (1981, pp 65-7)[1] and dating to c. 1,900 - 1,700BC



The axe is near-complete with some peripheral damage (with a surviving length of 101.3mm and a weight of 128.4g). The butt is now rounded (with a width of 20.6mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the median bevel (where the axe has a width of 23.9mm), after which the axe sides are concave and sharply divergent to the eroded blade tips. The blade was originally likely to have been comparatively widely expanded (with a maximum surviving blade width of 50.7mm)



The sides are heavily corroded and are convex across their thicknesses'. The flanges survive on both faces (with a surviving height of 1mm). There is a clear straight medial bevel (giving the axe a maximum thickness of 9.7mm, without the flanges and 11.8mm with), surviving on one of the faces (positioned 38.5mm from the butt, 62mm from the blade). The blade face is corroded but appears to have had a facet corresponding to the position where the sides expanded sharply (20mm from the blade edge). The original blade edge is lost but some surface survives on the blade, preserving sharpening striations running along the blade. The surface has a dark-green to brown patina with no trace of applied decoration.



The peripheral damage to the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The clear median bevel, straight sides behind the bevel and expanded blade edge suggest comparatively 'Developed' features on the axe, suggesting Type Bandon (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) or a probable Class 4 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming), dating to Periods 3-4 of the Early Bronze Age (c.1950-1500 BC) (Needham 1996). Class 4 axes straddle the boundary between Periods 2 and 3, but this axe can be confidently assigned to Period 3, probably falling within the late Aylesford to Willerby metalworking phases (c.1950-1750 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

The blade of the object is present and flares and the blade tips project backwards, one of which is damaged. It has a maximum width of 60.87 mm. The object is broken and so the butt is not present whcih makes the maximum length of the object 84.13 mm. The flanges are prominent and measure 18.33 mm in thickness. The septum thickness is 11.79 mm, and has a maximum width of 22.47 mm including the flanges. There is no stop ridge. The blade facet is clear, and the cutting edge is well preserved and still sharp. There are areas of corrosion across the object, particularly towards the irregular breakage at the top. A similar examples is LANCUM-19A734, or DOR-5D7F46, but with the flanges projecting closer towards the blade.

644526,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"Fragment of a Middle to Late Bronze Age axe of uncertain type, but of Developed Axe or Palstave form. Only a fragment of the butt-end survives. The fragment is rectangular in plan and triangular in section. It has wide flanges on both sides at the break giving the axe an 'H'-shaped section, and these flanges taper to the butt. The break is irregular and well patinated, suggesting that it occured by accident in antiquity. The surface is mottled green and pitted with areas of corrosion.



The length of the axe is 25mm, the width is 26mm. Each flange extends 2mm at the break. The body is 8mm thick.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981)[1] from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.

645421,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2000-1700 BC). The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 20.4 mm (thickness: 4.8 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.1 mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 35.5 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead. The axe is a mid to dark green to brown in colour colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axe measures 81.39 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 35.5 mm, width at the butt is 20.4 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 9.1 mm. It weighs 71.9 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped. These axes fit within metalworking stage IV, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Migdale Variant Biggar (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 18-19. 220 Knapton or 231 Brubster).
