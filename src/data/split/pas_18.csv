997089,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Incomplete cast copper alloy flat axehead dating from the Migdale tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC. The sides of the axehead look slightly raised on both faces but that is because the original surface, which has turned dark brown in colour, has only survived around the edges making it look crisper, and also on the blade above the slightly expanded but worn and rounded cutting edge. The axehead is sub-trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the butt end. The blade narrows towards the damaged butt end, but with almost straight sides. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now very pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away. 



Similar slender flat axeheads with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

997810,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy single looped palstave axe with high, protruding stopridge and incomplete preserved side loop, dating to the Mid Bronze Age (1300 to 1150BC), possibly relating to the Silsden types generally dated to the Penard. The axe is complete, except for the arch of the side loop. The body of the palstave is narrow but splays down the blade eventually flaring at the blade edge which is wide. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which may well have been hammered. The butt is squared, tapering with narrow flanges on both sides. The side loop is adjacent to the stop ridge and incomplete. Both sides of the blades are heavily pitted and scratched. There is green patina and iron-corrosion across the whole of the axe.



The palstave axe measures 132mm in length. The blade is 48.5mm wide and 2.5mm thick at the cutting edge and the butt 21.0mm wide and 14.0mm thick at the stop.The axe weighs 234 grams.



Similar to LANCUM-050851, the two Type Silsden side-looped palstaves can be dated to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 161). They are classified within the broader 'Late Palstave' type but are typologically close to 'Transitional Palstaves' such as Type Shelf (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160).

The awl's body is square in cross section (5.1x4.9mm). One end narrows relatively quickly (over c.10.1mm.) to a soft point that is tall (1.9mm) and thin (0.7mm). The opposite end narrows over a far longer distance (over c.20.4mm). This length of thw awl is bent slightly downwards and ends in a soft (square sectioned) point.



The awl is a medium green colour and slightly abraded.



The awl is 53.8mm long, 5.1mm wide and 4.9mm thick. It weighs 5.40 grams



Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin.  Plain awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).

The blade, although missing its tip, is lanceolate in shape (being broadly triangular in plan). There is a pronounced central spine on both faces which is triangular in form having a wide base at the tang that narrows to the tip of the spear. To either side of the spine is a low rib that is flanked by a shallow concave channel. Finally, the edges of the blade are heavily damaged by corrosion. The long and thin tang in broadly rectangular in cross-section with rounded corners, the end of the tang is truncated as a result of corrosion. 



The following is taken from record DUR-2372A1



This form of spearhead is relatively rare with only 47 examples recorded in the recent volume British Bronze Age Spearheads (Davis 2012). This form of spearhead corresponds with Davis's (2017) Group I form and of Arreton Down metalworking dating to the latest part of the Early Bronze Age, (Early Bronze Age III) which correspondes to Needham's (1996) Period 4 dated c. 1700 - 1500BC and Burgess's Metalworking stage VII.

The blade is slightly damaged at both corners, giving it a slightly triangular, truncated appearance, as opposed to its original flaring design. It is now 40.9mm wide at the blade. From this wide point, the blade tapers and becomes more slender and rectilinear, with a marked raised central rib on both faces. This rib is damaged, but the scar indicating its presence is visible where the raised rib itself is missing. It measures 8.2mm wide, and is 60.4mm in length. This rib joins the thickened stop, which is rounded in cross section, akin to two plano-convex shapes adhered to one another at the central point. The stop is 24.2mm wide, and 28.5mm thick. The septum, which is 53.4mm in length, continues to taper from the stop, with the channel between its two raised sides markedly rounded in appearance, with a rounded end where it joins the stop. One of these sides is badly damaged and almost missing. However, when viewed from the side, these two sides create a triangular shape which tapers to its narrowest angle at the butt. The butt is damaged. Possible casting lines are visible, suggesting the palstave may have been unfinished when it was deposited. 



Matt Knight has commented on a similar example: ""Palstaves of this type are typically found across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, as well as further eastwards in Dorset and Wiltshire. One particularly comparable example is a single find from Ashburton, Devon (Pearce 1983, 432-3, No.184, pl.23), though examples with varying decorations are also present in several hoards from Somerset (e.g. Sherford, Taunton Union Workhouse and Edington Burtle).""

The axehead has a long slender butt, tapering gently to the flared blade. It is rectangular in cross section, although the blade narrows to its original cutting surface. It appears undecorated but the surface is pitted and marked across the dark green shiny patina. There is a small area on one side near the blade which has decayed in a different manner, and is now a far brighter green and much more corroded, although there are no signs of bronze disease or ongoing decay. 



It is similar to CORN-68C636, the record for which states that:

1002966,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1550,350,"An incomplete piece of copper-alloy casting waste of middle Bronze Age to early Roman date, c.1550 BC – c.AD 350. It is likely to be from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould.



The object has an irregular sub-circular dished plate with the remains of two curved ovate jets projecting from one side. Both jets taper to faceted terminals which suggest they were cut transversely. A seam extends between the two jets.



The upper surface of the dished plate is pitted and rough. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. 



The metal has a dark brown patina and is worn. The object is 18.8mm long, 16.7mm wide, 3.4mm thick (11.1mm thick including jets) and weighs 4.9g.



Due to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from the Iron Age to Medieval period (c. 800 BC - AD 1500). Casting waste is difficult to date in isolation but the patina and form are suggestive of a Bronze Age - Roman date. The survival of casting waste in this period is relatively rare as it is usually recycled as a bi-product of casting.

1003430,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"Description: Penannular ring of probable Bronze Age date, probably from a composite ring. It is C-shaped in cross-section, with a convex outer and a concave interior. The width of the ring is very consistent but the two ends do not sit quite in line, as if the ring has been slightly bent out of shape. There is a c. 1.5mm gap between the two ends, one of which is slightly incurved and the other slightly outcurved, as if they once joined. The top and bottom edges are neat and parallel, but one is more highly polished than the other, which has a narrow roughened strip by its edge, perhaps keying for solder or perhaps the remains of gold solder.



Dimensions: Diameter 12.7mm, width of ring 5.3mm, thickness of ring 2.1 to 2.4mm, weight 2.8g. 



Discussion: Although penannular rings are well known Bronze Age finds, they normally have circular cross-sections, or sometimes D-shaped. C-shaped cross-sections are unusual, and are normally found on composite rings made from multiple bands soldered together; there is some evidence that this ring may once have been part of a soldered-together composite ring. Although the band widths on composite rings are usually much thinner than this example, the widest composite rings recorded on the PAS database are WILT-788C7B (2019T253) and ESS-71DFE4 (2014T169), where the individual bands are respectively almost 4mm wide, and 4.5mm wide. 



Date: Penannular rings belong to the middle Bronze Age, c. 1300-1150 BC.","As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.",3,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,2018-05-30T23:00:00Z,2020T369,,2.8,,12.7,2.4,,1,Helen Geake,Helen Geake,Eastern,Norfolk,South Norfolk,Caistor St. Edmund,TG2503,,52.57823439,1.31937422,NMS-E93EBA,,59730_E93EBA_BA_Ring.jpg,Bronze Age pennanular ring,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/59730_E93EBA_BA_Ring.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1110162.jpg

1003893,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy&nbsp;flat axehead, dating to 2350-1600 BC.&nbsp;

The axehead is convex on both the front and reverse, creating a pointed oval profile.&nbsp; In cross-section, the cutting edge and butt are also pointed oval, whilst the body is rectangular.&nbsp; The axe is narrowest at the butt and&nbsp;gradually expands into the body before widening abruptly to meet the cutting edge, which is curved with splayed outer sides.&nbsp; Overall, it has a&nbsp;yellowy-brown patina&nbsp;with green mottling and patches of dark red-brown.&nbsp; The axe has&nbsp;extensive pitting on all faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Measurments:&nbsp;length: 84.16mm, width of head: 47.92mm, width of terminal: 15.64mm, maximum thickness: 9.42mm, thickness of blade edge: 2.05mm, thickness of terminal edge: 1.47, weight: 96g.

1004329,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-950,"A complete copper-alloy Middle Bronze Age late looped palstave axehead dating to the Wilburton Industry (Needham Period 6, 1150-950 BC). 



The body of the axhead is roughly sub-rectangular in shape before flattening and flaring outwards to form a wide rounded blade edge and blade tips with slight cutting bevel along the blade edge. A pronounced stop ridge divides the haft from the blade end. Below this the edges narrow slightly and both faces are decorated with three raised longitudinal ribs that extend approximately a third of the way along each of the blade faces. The haft comprises just under half the length of the axehead with pronounced raised edges on either side, sections of which are broken or damaged in palces, that widen in profile to join the stop ridge. The flanges and end of the butt are broken but would have formed an H-shape cross-section. The result is a broadly sub-lozenge-shape profile that expands at the stop-ridge and arrows along the length of the blade. The casting flashes extending along the centre of each side are pronounced at the butt end and visible on each side of the blade but are much more worn. The loop, bridging the stop-ridge on one side, is lozenge-shape in cross-section and sits in line with the casting flash that extends along its surface.



All surfaces of the axehead have a relatively consistent mid-green and brown patina.



The axe measures 140mm in length. The blade is 40mm wide and 1.8mm thick at the cutting edge. The stop is 23mm wide and 30.5mm at its thickest, and the butt is 22.2mm wide and 7.5mm thick. The entire object weighs 353 grams.



This palstave has features causing it to sit between several types. For example Schmidt and Burgess (1981: plate 59, no 815)  illustrate a similar example defined as a group 3 low flanged palstave sleaford type, which has a flared broader blade than this example, the short but narrow form is also similar to transtional types, although these tend to have plainer, if any decoration, while a very similar late example (plate 67 no.928) is identical albeit this example lack the diagnoasic projecting stop ridge typical of late palstaves. It maytherefore appropriate to suggest that this form may date from the as early as group 3 palstaves (c.1400 cal BC) into the Late Bronze Age wilburton period (1200-1000 cal BC) until a parallel within a hoard is identified. Rowlands (1976) does not illustrate any similar examples but focusses primairly on Middle bronze age forms which support a transtional/Late Bronze Age date.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-11-02T00:00:00Z,2019-11-02T00:00:00Z,,,353,,,30.5,140,1,Matthew Fittock,Matthew Fittock,South East,Oxfordshire,South Oxfordshire,Clifton Hampden,SU5395,GPS (from the finder),51.65130221,-1.23532693,BH-4CDE5E,,AxeHead.jpg,Middle Bronze Age late looped palstave axehead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/AxeHead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1106468.jpg

The object is triangular in plan and in cross-section forms a shallow triangle.  It consists of two portions: a pointed blade tip that widens into the remaining small portion of the body and a terminal end, formed by the body then narrowing to a short neck before expanding out to form a sub-circular terminal end; it is not discernable whether the neck and sub-circular terminal are designed features e.g. notches or due to extensive corrosion.  The reverse of the object is flat but the front has as central rib with a bevelled edge either side, which meet the long edges of the blade.

1006105,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy Middle Bronze Age socketed spearhead, in two conjoining pieces, dating to the period 1500-1150 BC. The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade that tapers towards the tip and bevelled wings that gradually expand from the tip before tapering inwards towards the socketed shaft. The wing edges are very worn and damaged in several places, and a circular cross-sectional rib extends from tip to base. 



The shaft is broken where it connects to the head. It is broadly sub-conical in shape, being square in cross-section beneath the head before transitioning gradually to circular in cross-section as it increases in diameter towards the open-ended terminal. There are small loops either side of the shaft, each measuring 13mm in length and with perforations 3mm long. A circular hole perforates the body of the shaft next to one of the loops and there is a parallel semi-circular notch of damage extending into the lower edge of the socketed terminal.



The spear has an even dark-brown patina with small patches of green where pitting occurs across both faces of the blade and the body of the socket.



The spear, when conjoined, measures 79mm in length. The blade is 16mm wide, a maximum of 7mm thick at the axial ridge and 1.2mm thick along the blade edge. The socketed shaft is 7.5mm wide and thick underneath the head. The socketed terminal is 15.6mm diameter and 1.8mm thick.



This looped spearhead is part of the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions and is dated to the Middle Bronze Age between c. 1500 - 1150BC.

1006222,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2400,-2200,"Early Bronze Age copper flat axehead, c. 2400 – 2200BC



The cast flat axe is fragmentary, represented by a butt fragment (with a surviving length of 63.4mm and a weight of 160.6g) and would have been from a large axe. The butt is wide and straight (with a width of 50.3mm and a thickness of 4mm). The sides of the axe were near-straight as far as the break and are gradually divergent (with a maximum width at the break of 58.7mm where the axe has a maximum thickness of 8.8mm). The sides are slightly rounded across their depths, producing a sub-rectangular body section. The axe faces are flat across both their lengths and widths, gradually becoming thicker but with no suggestion of a median bevel or similar feature. 



The surface has a mid-dark brown coarse corrosion with some pale-green corrosion products, possibly indicating copper rather than bronze. 



The axe form is broad butted and is likely to have been a large example. The axe has few developed features but the thinned butt would perhaps suggest an axe of Type Growtown, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p. 23). The fragmentary condition of the axe makes its exact typological identification using Needham’s (2017) classification uncertain. However the suggested copper metallurgy and wide but thinned butt would suggest a lenticular long-profile and indicate a Class 2 axe and the wide, straight butt would indicate a Class 2A or 2B axe. Chalcolithic axes of Class 2 A / B can be dated to Period 1, c. 2400 – 2200BC and are amongst some of the earliest metal objects recorded from Wales.  



A study by Needham (2017) listed four axes of Class 2A or B from Wales and the marches, from Shropshire, Flintshire and Powys.

1006333,Votive Model,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1000,-500,"A complete Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age copper alloy votive model of a miniature wheel dated to c. 1000-500 BC.



The wheel is circular in plan and D-shaped in cross section with each elements of the wheel (its spokes, rim and centre) being convex on the front and flat on the back. The wheel has a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate, narrowing as they do, before joining the outer rim. The holes between each of the axel are sub-oval, almost pointed ovals. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle (c.3.0mm diameter) this shows little sign of ware.



The wheel has a dark brown patina with some thicker patches of dark green patina.



The wheel is 20.3mm in diameter, 2.0mm thick and weighs 2.37 grams



There are a growing number of examples of votive wheels on the database. Particularly similar examples to this object include GLO-E82DE1, KENT-9348EE, KENT-70F063, SF-987EE3 and NMS-1CDC66. However,  SWYOR-0B3992, whose additional hole may suggest it was a pastry jigger, and NLM-B563BC, which has an Iron axel suggesting it is the wheel for a toy cannon, demonstrate that such a form is shared by artefacts of other dates and purposes. Later Prehistoric examples can also take different forms including three spokes (e.g. SOM-C30265) or be more bulbous (e.g. HESH-C53CF4).  



A tin example of a wheel, not dissimilar to this example, has been found at Flag Fen (Pryor 2001: 272-273, No.154) which cites parallels found in Late Bronze Age contexts in Switzerland (Pryor 2001: 291). A further example of this type is held by the British Museum (accession No. 1989,0601.21) found in an Iron Age Hoard while a more bulbous example is held by the British Museum (Accession NO. 1864,0501.11).

Description: The parallel sided strip of gold has twelve (possibly thirteen) embossed longitudinal lines visible on both faces, giving a corrugated effect. Both ends appear to be breaks, and the strip has broken into two pieces post-recovery. Both long edges are folded making a thicker edge. About 2.6mm - 2.8mm of the sheet is folded over on each edge. This flange is damaged and partially missing on one long edge, and partially unfolded. There is some modern damage on the outer face of the larger piece, in the form of transverse scratches across the face. The whole object is bent and creased and was probably more crumpled when first found, the modern break appearing to be along a previous fold. 



The finder took the object to be tested by a jeweller who reports that it is 20ct and 5g. Short piece: 29.9mm long, 14.2mm wide, 1.3mm thick as folded. The sheet is 0.3mm thick. Larger piece: 47.6mm long, 14.7mm wide, 0.6mm thick as folded. The sheet is 0.4mm thick. 



Discussion: Several ribbons of Bronze Age date have been previously reported as Treasure. Many of these have incised decoration on one face only, rather than the ribbed and corrugated effect seen on this piece. An example is WAW-C0C0B3 (2007 T672) which is published as number 38 on page 47 and 303 of the 2007 Treasure Annual Report.



Examples with embossed linear decoration include WMID-3CBCF0 (2013 T471) for which the record by Teresa Gilmore and Neil Wilkin notes that ""Similar multi-grooved strips of a Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48) [this is mentioned above and is only decorated on one side]. A very similar strip from Sproxton, North Yorkshire is recorded on the PAS database as LVPL-83FE92 [2010 T664]. There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England."". Another similar examples is WMID-FE3C28 (2016 T1039).



The embossed rather than incised decoration makes an early Bronze Age date seem more likely, but a date in the middle to late Bronze Age cannot be entirely discounted.","This object is made of precious metal and is more than 300 years old, so it appears to meet the requirements of the 1996 Treasure Act.",4,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2020-04-30T23:00:00Z,2020-05-30T23:00:00Z,2020T516,,5,,,1.3,76.5,1,Amy Downes,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,Doncaster,Doncaster,Askern,SE5713,Generated from computer mapping software,53.6104616,-1.13994135,SWYOR-DBF058,,SWYORDBF058UnknownUnidentifiedObjectikw.jpg,SWYOR-DBF058 Unknown Unidentified Object,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYORDBF058UnknownUnidentifiedObjectikw.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1120891.jpg
1007535,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed knife of Thorndon Type and of Ewart Park metalworking, corresponding with Needham’s Period 7, dated to c. 950-750BC



The cast knife is near-complete, but in two fragments, broken across the slightly distorted blade (with a distorted length of 134.4mm and a weight of 37.7g). The socket has a sub-oval mouth (21.8mm x 12.7mm external, 17.6mm x 10.0mm and 33.2mm deep) and has gently concave, waisted sides (with a minimum width of 18.6mm). The socket faces are gradually convergent towards the blade and have two perforations to secure handle, the upper perforation is central and larger (at 5.1mm – 5.9mm diameter) and the lower is towards one side, smaller and somewhat irregular on one face (at 4.4mm – 6.5mm) and may be a secondary attachment attempt. One side of the socket sides has a sub-linear opening (18.8mm long 2.5mm – 5.2mm wide), probably a casting flaw. The socket and the blade have a near-linear junction, helping to define the knife as Thorndon type. The blade is both widest and thickest beneath the socket (with a width and thickness of 19.9mm and 4.2mm respectively and a minimum thickness above the tip of 0.8mm). The edges are convergent and concave below the socket (for 18mm) before being straight and gently convergent until just above the tip (14mm). The blade has a flattened midsection (8.8mm wide at the socket and 3.2mm wide above the tip), flanked by gently concave blade facets and giving a hexagonal blade section.  Both blade edges have considerable damage and nicks, all of which have patinated surfaces, suggesting, they may be contemporary with the use of the knife, or may have occurred post deposition but some time ago. The blade has a shallow S-shaped bend, at the top and mid blade, which is likely to have resulted in the break. The surface on one face is heavily-pitted around both the bend and break. The surface has a pale to mid green patina with no clear evidence for sharpening striations on the blade edge. 



Thorndon Socketed knives have a distribution perceived as being concentrated in Southern England. As of 2006, there were seven recorded socketed knives of Thorndon type know from south- western Britain, and specifically Wales (Gwilt, 2006, p 54)[1] , with a largely North Wales distribution and with only one outlier in South Wales, recovered within the St Nicholas hoard from the Vale of Glamorgan. Since then a hoard from Glascoed in Monmouthshire also contained a fragment of a Thorndon type socketed knife and another two examples have been recorded with PAS[2] from Bridgend and Newport in South Wales. There are no examples recorded with PAS from Gloucestershire at the time of writing. The Thorndon type knives from the South Wales hoards are associated with Ewart Park metalworking but both hoards also contain an element of the Carp’s Tongue complex.



The two fragments were found approximately 3.5m apart and were at a depth of approximately 0.12m, seemingly within ploughsoil and separated by the plough.

The axehead is complete (with an overall length of 97.0mm and a weight of 261.8g). The mouth is sub-rectangular (52.3mm long and 43.7 wide) and the four casting runner stubs are evident and raised, positioned on the inner lip of the mouth. There is some damage around one of the runner stubs, with a crack which extends down the face (for 17mm). The socket is rectangular (34.3mm x 30.5.0mm and 71.3mm deep).&nbsp; The mouth moulding has a rounded step (6mm &ndash; 7mm long) well-defined on one face, with a prominent step to the face. The oval sectioned loop springs from the moulding (5mm wide, 6mm thick and 35mm long), enclosing a D-shaped loop (15.9mm x 6.5mm). The sides are gently concave with a minimum width below the loop (40.0mm) before widening to a moderately expanded blade edge (52.3mm wide). The blade edge survives and is gently curved at the centre before curving out to the blade tips. There are a series of nicks at the blade edge, mostly in the central area and appear to be beneath the patina. One side has some damage, which has cut through the patina. The casting seams are prominent and raised (up to 2mm high) but have been neatly finished. The sides are slightly bevelled towards the central seam but are comparatively straight for the type, producing a near-rectangular body section. Both faces are decorated with three near-parallel ribs, which extend a little over half the length of the face (for 55mm). The ribs on one face are interrupted and poorly cast. The edges of the faces appear slightly developed to resemble weak ribs. The faces are gently convex across both their lengths and widths, with one face being more convex in both plains than the other and there are no blade facets. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running off the blade. The blades on both faces have a marked colour difference to the remainder of the faces (12mm from the edge). The axe has a black patination, probably of tenorite, as observed on other contemporary axes. The pale-green patination on the blade end, suggests that the tenorite was removed during the axe finishing. The probable tenorite is also evident over the top of the runner stubs. Numerous small hammer facets are also evident on the blades, below the ends of the ribs. 

The socketed axe is typical of the South Wales (Stogursey) Type, although the near-rectangular body section is a little unusual. The clear patination difference on the end of the blade is of interest to the research informing the deliberate colouring of Late Bronze Age metalwork.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,261.8,,,,97,1,,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Pont-y-Clun,ST0580,,51.5109127,-3.3703334,NMGW-07EA87,,201919copy1.jpg,Bronze Age South Wales type Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/201919copy1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1110105.jpg

The cast chisel is near-complete with a slightly distorted tang (with a length of 50.8mm and a weight of 15.9g). The tang (32.6mm long) is square to rectangular sectioned gradually narrowing to the end (6mm square at the collar and 3.0mm x 1.4mm at the end). There is a perpendicular step to the collar (2mm deep) of sub-oval form (11.1mm long and 9.3mm wide) and narrows below the flanged shoulder (with a minimum width of 7.8mm). The sides of the blade are curved and divergent to the slightly damaged blade tips and the blade edge is near-straight, curved at the ends (giving a blade width of 20.5mm). The original blade edge has been lost with no definite evidence for differential wear across the blade edge. The blade faces are near-flat and thin gradually towards the edge (with a thickness of 7mm below the shoulder and 0.8mm above the edge) and with no evidence for blade facets. There are striations beneath the patina on both faces, running both along the blade and up the blade. The surface is pitted with a mid-green patina and areas of surface loss. 



Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Earliest Iron Age. An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the many may be dated to the Ewart Park phase (c.950-700 BC) and into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt 'C' sword.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,15.9,,,7,50.8,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Bremhill,ST9875,,51.47395858,-2.03018701,NMGW-E96F08,,NMWPA201926.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/NMWPA201926.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1110779.jpg
1008175,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1000,"Middle to Late Bronze Age socketed axehead of uncertain type, possibly related to Type Wallington (Schmidt &amp; Burgess, 1980, p. 175-6)[1] of Wilburton Wallington metalworking dated to c. 1300 &ndash; 1000BC

The cast axehead is complete (with a length of 102.6mm and a weight of 242.2g). The interior of the mouth is oval (27.2mm x 190mm) and the top irregular with the suggestion of four-runner casting. The exterior of the mouth is sub-rectangular (39.6mm x 27.5mm) with a prominent rounded mouth moulding or collar (3mm &ndash; 6mm thick and 10mm -13mm long) and has a noticeable shelf on the sides. The corners of the moulding are noticeably angular. The loop (19.4mm long, 11.0mm high and 7.0mm wide) springs from the base of the moulding. The sides of the axe are straight and near-parallel on their upper half and flat across the depths, producing a rectangular body section to the axe. The lower half of the axe sides are divergent, with the unlooped side being near-straight and the looped side gently concave. The flattened casting seams are evident on both sides and are both off-centre. The axe is widest across the expanded blade (with a blade width of 46.8mm) and has a moderate curvature (6mm deep).&nbsp; The faces are near-flat across their widths and convergent but convex across their lengths with no blade facets or ribs present. The surface is corroded with a rough corrosion product and dark-green patina. There is a clear discernible black surface beneath the corrosion on the upper two-thirds of the axe, probably tenorite.

The interior of the socket has at least two small fragments of copper alloy wedged at its base. One fragment appears to be plate bronze and may be an axe wall fragment or similar, the other fragment below is thicker with a right-angled corner, possibly a blade.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The axe appears to share some characteristics of early socketed axes, principally it&rsquo;s slender rectangular body section, mouth moulding and parallel sides. This axe also has some more developed features, such as the expanded blade with divergent sides above the blade. The angular corners of the moulding may be seen as similar to Amorican axes of Llyn Fawr metalworking but the mouth is clearly not of front-back form. An early, Wallington is possible but a later Ewart Park (c. 1000 &ndash; 700BC) date is perhaps more likely.

Discussion: Penannular rings are not uncommon finds reported Treasure and recorded on the PAS database. Other examples featuring similar ‘tiger striped’ decoration include: 2019 T1091 (HAMP-BE4072) and 2020 T780 (NLM-59A99B). The report and PAS database record for 2020 T77 (OXON-FFD016) notes that ring “appears similar to a class of artefact which have in the past been given various terms such as 'hair-rings' (Eogan 1997) and other monikers such as ‘Ring Money’ (Green 1988) which are now no longer supported (Taylor 1980, 65; Varndell 2001). Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003 opinion cited, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange”.","In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

Awls are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.31,,,3.85,91.94,1,Denise Wilding,Denise Wilding,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Broad Chalke,SU0223,,51.00638245,-1.97286895,WILT-BC913A,,WILTBC913A.jpg,Bronze Age awl,Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/denisewilding/WILTBC913A.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1111612.jpg

It comprises a crumpled strip of sheet or ribbon gold around 63.7mm in length, decorated with around 10 parallel ridges running along its length across one side; the reverse is undecorated. There is a partial tear across the mid section, probably from post depositional damage. The object has a rounded terminal with a ragged pierced oval hole. The other end of the object tapers into a narrow square-sectioned hook which curves under the plate and ends up 2mm wide. The surface of this terminal is smooth and undecorated, with the ridged decoration stopping short of it.  



Length: 63.7mm; Width: 9.8mm; Thickness: 0.3mm; Weight: 3.5g.","This appears to be a flattened item of personal adornment, originally secured in a loop using the hook and piercing and perhaps used as an earring, or finger ring. The presence of these features places this example into a less common group of Bronze Age ribbon gold artefacts found with fittings. Eogan (1994) has categorised these objects as ‘Tress’-rings, including them in his discussion of gold working in the mid to late Bronze Age. More generally, there are a range of comparable ribbon gold ornaments known from the duration of the Bronze Age, particularly from the 'ornament horizon' of the Taunton and Penard phases of the Middle Bronze Age (Roberts 2007).  This object also however finds parallels in its form within the earlier Bronze Age sheet gold tradition and an excavated example found in Oxford in a sealed alluvial deposit along with a Beaker period flint scraper and pottery (Palmer 1980) suggests that an early Bronze Age date for this type of artefact is entirely possible.

1008904,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-750,"A complete gold penannular bar bracelet, dating to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1400BC-750BC).

Description:&nbsp;The bracelet is composed of a cylindrical bar, curved to create a sub-oval shape in plan. The terminals of the bar are slightly expanded and, from the photograph,&nbsp;appear sub-circular in section with short, incised linear decoration.

1010372,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,950,750,"A cast bronze (copper alloy) faceted socketed axe of late Bronze Age date (950 &ndash; 750&nbsp;BC). The axe is relatively short and stubby and is known as &lsquo;baggy axe&rsquo;. 

The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with concave sides and a flared convex cutting edge. The mouth of the socket is broadly oval. The mouth of the socket has a moulded collar, although some of the original surface is missing. Visible on one side only below the collar are two moulded ribs as decoration. At the base of the collar, on one edge are the remains of a loop. All that remains now of the loop are two circular incomplete projections with well-developed patinas. 

The two long sides of the axe are concave at the centre before expanding to a crescent shaped blade. The casting seams are visible on both long edges.&nbsp;The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge, although much of the original surface has been lost from abrasion and corrosion. Therefore it is difficult to establish how well used and worn the original blade edge was in antiquity.

The socketed axe head has a dark brown coloured patina across all surfaces with some areas of active corrosion around the socket. There are many areas where the original surface has been lost especially around the blade and on the socket mouth. There is no evidence of organic residue within the socket of the axe. 

Thanks are given to Peter Reavill for his help in identifying this type of axe. He has recorded a similar example discovered in Shropshire (HESH-07A7E3) Here he explains the parallels&hellip;.

These axes have been discovered in associated with the late Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase XI) and the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham&rsquo;s (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-700 CAL.&nbsp;BC. This axe is of a type which is known as Type Gillespie, which Burgess and Schmidt suggest is associated with later Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase XI) and Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). They are also discovered in Ireland and are associated with the Dowris tradition. It has been suggested that this form of facet axe continues production into the Llyn Fawr tradition (which is the transitional period between the metalwork of the Bronze and Iron Ages). Similar axes have been illustrated in Burgess and Schmidt and the best parallels are cat no 1101 Kilkerran, Scotland, 1109 Graham&rsquo;s Mount, and 1112 Hatton, Angus. A more local example can be seen in the Savory Welsh catalogue from a small hoard of axes discovered at Llandaff, Glamorganshire (cat no 282). This Welsh axe had been analysed and the metal content was comparable with axes from the second phase of the Late Bronze Age (LBA&nbsp;II) which Savory dates 750-600&nbsp;BC&nbsp;but would actually be better described as Ewart Park 950-750&nbsp;BC.

The axe measures 77.8 mm length, 49.7 mm width, is 40.2 mm thick, the thickness of the walls of the axe measure 6.8 mm on one side and 6.4 mm on the other.

1010922,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy / bronze ribbed socketed axe of later Bronze Age / Ewart Park date (c. 950-800 BC). 



Description: The axehead is relatively robust with a square shaped mouth and relatively straight sides which expand at each end. The blade ends expands to a short cutting edge. The mouth of the axehead is fairly worn but appears to be poorly finished with casting flash seam lines still prominent along the sides and continuing down the body of the axehead towards the blade edge. The mouth moulding / collar around the mouth is swollen with a prominent bulbous or convex external ridge. Beneath this is a slight transverse moulded rib which extends across both faces and sides and is aligned with the upper edge of the side loop. The side loop is relatively small and wide being set in a tight position beneath the collar in line with this horizontal rib. The loop is D shaped in cross section.



On the front and rear faces of the axe, six parallel longitudinal ribs descend from the lower edge horizontal rib. The ribs are complete on one side and terminate in blunt points halfway along thebody. One wide face near the socket is incomplete having been broken in antiquity. The external edges of the axe are also slightly raised giving the impression of six descending ribs. The cutting edge is also straight and may have been heavily reworked. Overall the axehead has a mid-green patina towards the blade and dark grey-green towards the socket particularly on the sides. Most damage seems to have been heavily patinated indicating it occurred in antiquity. 



Measurements: 100.82mm long, 43.75mm wide (including loop, collared mouth 39.53mm wide), 27.3mm thick and 178.88g in weight. 



Discussion: The axehead dates to the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age 950 - 750 BC and due to the straight sides the date range may also fit with Bronze - Iron Age transition period known as Llyn Fawr which extends the date range to c. 650 BC. Needham (1996) period 7-8 Metalworking stage XII - XIII.  The form roughly fits the South-Eastern types illustrated in Schmidt & Burgess (1981).

The objects comprise:





1)    An incomplete socketed axehead with a single side loop. The tip is missing from what appears to be an ancient break. The socket is irregular in shape, somewhere between sub-rectangular and sub trapezoidal with a thick moulded rim. The cross section of the blade is rectangular at the break; the sides are parallel, suggesting that the cutting edge was relatively narrow.





Length: 101mm; width: 48mm; thickness: 32.7mm; weight: 240.82g.





2)    A fragment of the butt end of a palstave axehead. The corroded remnants of flanges are present on both sides, suggesting it was a long-flanged type; the cross section is H shaped with flat faces between the flanged sides.





Length: 40.6mm; width: 26.6mm; thickness: 13.6mm; weight: 46.42g.





3)    Two fragments of plano-convex copper alloy “bun” ingots: 56.6mm by 46.5mm by 24.8mm, 292.18g; 54.6mm by 55.4mm by 21.2mm, 226.11g. Both are square in plan, with one curved and one flat face and a wedge-shaped side profile.","These objects are all heavily corroded as a result of deposition in acidic greensand soils. The socketed axehead is a typically later Bronze Age type (c 1150 - 600 BC), whilst the flanged palstave is more typical of the middle Bronze Age (c 1500-1100 BC), but is also a common type of inclusion in later mixed assemblages. The bun ingots, with characteristically plano convex surfaces suggesting an origin in a bowl furnace, are also typically a product of the later Bronze Age and are often found in hoards with axeheads such as these and other implements. Due to the degraded nature of the break edges it impossible to say whether these ingot fragments belong to one or multiple ingots.  

The very close proximity of the findspots and overlapping date ranges of the finds strongly suggests that they were originally deposited as a coherent group. The composition of the assemblage is suggestive of a metalworker’s hoard, with the mixture of socketed axehead and copper ingots seen here being most common in the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2020-06-06T23:00:00Z,,2020T781,,,,,,,4,Simon Maslin,Simon Maslin,South East,Surrey,Guildford,Shere,TQ0849,From finder,51.22997929,-0.45460018,SUR-C8315D,,SURC8315D_palstave2.jpg,,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURC8315D_palstave2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1124176.jpg

Description: The axehead has relatively straight sides which expand towards the base to form a neat cutting edge. The blade edge has a nick out of one corner but is relatively complete and short typical of the type. The axehead is fairly worn but appears to be poorly finished with casting flash and seam lines still prominent along the sides.

It has a rectangular cross-section and one half tapers from the centre towards a chisel shape end, while the other half, with a slightly more rounded section, tapers towards a pointed end. It is in good condition, has a dark grey-green colour and a prominent casting seam along both sides of its length. Plain copper alloy awls are hard to date precisely but examples of this form are thought to have been introduced in the Bronze Age and they have barely changed throughout the centuries. They were used as leather and wood working tools.

1013309,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1100,-800,"A heavily worn fragment of cast Late Bronze Age copper alloy socketed axe head, probably dating to 1100-800 BC.



Description: The fragment represents part of the blade end of the long rectangular socketed body of the axehead. No edge remains intact so over all shape is based on known more complete examples. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips likely flared slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible . The axehead is patinated dark green and mottled light brown to green across the abraded edges.

Discussion: Although, due to completeness it is not certain but this axehead probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,19.37,,,10.42,23.67,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Dover,Eythorne,TR2749,GPS (from the finder),51.19510472,1.24755845,KENT-5D01D6,,KENT5D01D6.jpg,Socketed axehead fragment,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT5D01D6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1118945.jpg
1013388,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A cast copper alloy fragment of a Late Bronze Age sword dating to c.1000-800 BC. The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-oval in section with both ends terminating in old damage. The fragment is a small section of the blade with a convex/raised midrib (14mm wide, max 8.8mm thick) flanked by a pair of parallel longitudinal grooves on either side c.3mm from the long edge on both faces. The grooves do not appear to narrow on the fragment and the distance is the same between the lines at the upper and lower section of the fragment (14mm) although the long edges of the blade are damaged from corrosion so the cutting edge has been lost.



The tip of the object is rounded and pitted with bright green corrosion. The other end has a central concentric depression c.3.5mm in diameter in profile. One side of the blade has 3 small holes, likely corrosion products. 



The fragment is small and lacking diagnostic features so it is difficult to ascribe a type with certainty. A similar sword fragment of Carp’s Tongue type with two longitudinal grooves is illustrated in Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015:99 pl. 26 no. 325) from West Knighton, Dorset. Burgess (1968:22 fig. 13) also illustrates a sword from the River Thames dating to the Carp’s Tongue complex of the Late Bronze Age. The fragment is likely from a Carp’s Tongue type sword of the Ewart Park phase of metalwork.



The object is a medium green patina with patches of bright green corrosion and measures 27.8mm long, 21.5mm wide, 8.8mm thick and weighs 16.05kg.

1013449,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-700,"An incomplete copper alloy socketed axehead dating to the Late Bronze Age (c. 1300-700 BC). The remains of the object consist of the blade edge and part of the body, which terminates in an uneven worn break leaving part of the socketed interior visible. The break is slightly higher on one side of the axehead than the other, thus the tapered sides of the body of the axehead are visible. The blade edge is curved but very worn and chipped. The axehead has a thick dark reddish brown patina in patches across its surface (c. 30%), however much of this has been chipped and abraded away revealing a brown patina underneath. It is not possible to identify whether the axe has been sharpened or whether a casting seam existed due to most of its patina being chipped away. 



The lack of diagnostic features from this axehead fragment prevents a more exact type or parallel for its form being cited, however socketed axeheads are believed to date from the Middle Bronze Age (c.1300 BC) to the Earliest Iron Age (c.700/600 BC).

This axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, with some slight recurving.



Shallow ovate cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a lenticular side profile.



There is a raised transverse stop-ridge running half way down the butt length. 



The metal is brown in colour with areas of light blue active copper alloy disease on both faces, predominant on one face but present on the other.

Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, ""...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembelleshed faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature. Decoration...becomes a commonplace...""



Schmidt and Burgess (ibid.) explain that these developments were in part a function of changing hafting methods - the knee handle, with forked angled end required a narrower shape to fit snugly between the prongs of the fork. Furthermore, dished faces and raised edges made the seating more secure, and the median bevel reduced the tendency of the axe to be driven up into the fork, (WMID-143A14).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,439,,,25.84,134.42,1,Ellie Cox,Ellie Cox,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,South Northamptonshire,Hartwell,SP8051,From finder,52.15149812,-0.83215728,NARC-24B0E9,,NARC24B0E9.jpg,NARC-24B0E9 : Axehead : Early-Middle Bronze Age,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC24B0E9.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1122002.jpg

Incised longitudinal grooves are present on at least one side of many of these examples. Some are plain strips whilst others exhibit one or two perforations. Furthermore, the design is redolent of two examples from the multi-period site of Ranvecliffe Cave in Derbyshire, held within the British Museum Collections 1906.1224.1 and 1906.1224.2. These examples were postulated to date to the period between circa 2500-800&nbsp;BC, providing a broad Late Neolithic to Late Bronze Age date. Other dates recorded within the Treasure cases suggest a narrower period between circa 2200-800, encompassing the entirety of the Bronze Age, whilst 2014T777 suggests a Middle to Late Bronze Age date of between circa 1600-800&nbsp;BC. As a result, a broad Bronze Age date is offered here of between circa 2300-800&nbsp;BC.

It is broadly sub trapezoid in plan, although the axe has lost too much of its original shape to confidently assign it to a type using Schmidt and Burgess (1981). No. 270, pg. 50, Plate 22 has a generally similar shape apart from its smaller, flatter butt. The axe itself has a fairly narrow and rounded butt (36.5mm wide) and appears to have relatively straight sides although one is slightly convex- again it is difficult to tell the original side shape due to the heavy corrosion. The cutting edge is strongly curved and unexpanded. The axe is flat lenticular in profile, and rectangular in section. 



The axe is heavily corroded, with much of the surface covered with active corrosion and corrosion products. This corrosion has led to the total loss of the original surface, changing the shape of the axe. The parts of the axe not covered by corrosion bear a dull red brown patina of uneven, pitted texture. The dull red colour may suggest that the axe is made of copper rather than copper alloy, which would date it to the chalcolithic, the earliest part of the Bronze Age (c. 2500-2200 BC).",,4,Copper,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,253.6,,,10.2,107.8,1,George Whatley,George Whatley,Wales,Carmarthenshire,Carmarthenshire,Llandyfaelog,SN4316,,51.82050768,-4.27932397,NMGW-3B328A,,FlatAxe.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/FlatAxe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1122847.jpg

The object is sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is narrowed and rounded in profile. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. There are no traces of a stop ridge present. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade are abraded as is the blade edge itself.

These are thin and rectangular in cross-section: flat on the internal and external edges of the loop. However, there is a concave bevelled constriction in the middle of both sides, just above the junction with the shank (best viewed from the top).

The shank is oval in cross-section and emerges from the head with a significant concave taper over the first five millimetres of its length. Over approximately this same distance, the longest axis of the oval cross-section is parallel with the plane of the head. After that, the taper is much more subtle and the shank twists so that its long axis is oblique to the plane of the head. It maintains this orientation and taper throughout the rest of its length. The tip is blunt and probably represents a worn break. There is a slight bend in the shank, at just over halfway along its extant length from the head. Most of the shank has a dark green patina, becoming dark brown near and on the stumps of the head. See NMS-3D6677 on this database for a more complete example. c.1400-1250 BC.

1018446,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"A copper alloy long flanged flat axehead of Needham (2017) Type 4d or e dating to the Early Bronze Age c. 2050-1700 cal BC.



Description: This axe head has a rounded arched butt, a body that starts narrow but increasingly widens, a crescentic blade edge and long low flanges. The low flanges are worn to the point they are barely discernable  From this point the body of the axe (the septum) thickens regularly to a point just further than half way along its length (c.45 mm from the butt). At this point there is a shallow, almost imperceptible, thickened ridge, which may indicate the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. 



After the proto stop-ridge the body of the axe thin gradually to the blade edge of the axe. Concurrently the body of the axehead widens in a smooth curve so that the wings at the side of the axeblade are almost perpendicular to the body of the axe. The blade edge itself is crescent shaped and slightly more angled than the narrowing body. One corner has been damaged. The blade edge is slightly bevelled indicating it has been sharpened at least once. The surface of the axehead is heavily patinated and surfacely pitted. It has a mottled dark green through to light grey-green colouration



Measurements: 99.39mm long, 50.82mm wide (at blade end, 23.1mm wide at mid point, 17.82mm wide at butt end), 12.67mm thick and 156.59g in weight



Discussion: This is a low flanged axe of Early Bronze Age date. The lack of developed stop ridge suggests it most likely dates to the later stages of the Early Bronze Age. Needham (1983, 2017) has produced a typology of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age flat and flanged axeheads that defines them based on the ratios of their physical form (Needham 2017, 4, Table 1). This axe meets all the criteria for a Type 4e Axehead and most closely corresponds to a Type 4E Withington form (Needham, 2017, 27-29, 55-56). Needham places the date of this type of axe to between the 20th and 18th centuries cal BC c. 1900-1700 cal BC (ibid 45, fig 16).



These axes are traditionally assigned to the Long Flanged or Developed Flat Axe of Aylesford type (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) that fit with Burgess’ metalworking tradition phase IV, and corresponds to Needham’s (1996) Period 3 (circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC)

1018995,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-950,"A complete cast copper alloy (bronze) palstave axe with side loop and decorative rib of Bronze Age date, most probably from the period 1050-950 BC.



Description: The axe is broadly rectangular in plan and ovoid in profile. The blade of the palstave has straight sides that flare to form a crescent shaped cutting edge. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The two sides flare progressively from the butt to the raised and thickened stop. The flanges are fused to the stop and the septum of the axe is relatively plain and undecorated. The casting seams and associated flashes on either side (long edge) have been trimmed and hammered almost flat. An integrally cast side loop descends on one edge; it is positioned immediately below the stop towards the blade. The loop is D-shaped in cross-section.  Below the stop ridge of the axe on the upper blade is a central rib which continues towards the cutting edge of the blade, tapering to flatness at about 25mm from the cutting edge. The rib is present on both faces - although better defined on one. Each face has two further ribs which run from the butt to join the central rib at 20mm towards the blade - again one side is more defined. The palstave has a well-defined polished dark green/brown coloured surface patina which is pitted and broken in places, exposing areas of corrosion, particularly along the external and raised edges.



Measurments: length: 170mm; width (across the blade): 61.63mm; width (across the butt): 20.8mm; thickness (across the stop): 25.22mm; thickness (of the septum in the mid point of the butt): 7.14mm. The side flanges raise to a height of 9.2mm above the septum. The axehead weighs 387.6 grams.

The palstave has a high, stop with high flanges on both sides. The blade has flattened flanges running on each edge with irregular facets and flares to a curved cutting edge. A central rib runs down the middle of each side of the blade from the stop. The axe is heavily corroded and missing the butt and half of the cutting edge.

1019074,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-800,"Bronze Age bronze double-edged tanged and riveted knife of Middle to Late Bronze Age date



The cast knife blade is fragmentary by the tang and top of the blade (with a surviving length of 85.0mm and weight of 14.2g). The tang (48mm long) is narrowest and thinnest at the butt (10.6mm wide and 0.9mm thick) which has a slight indent at the centre. Below the butt is a sub-circular perforation (4.0mm – 4.3mm diameter positioned 5.3mm below the butt). The sides of the tang are straight and gently divergent towards the top of the blade (reaching a width and thickness of 14.9mm and 2.8mm respectively). Both tang faces are convex across their widths, producing a sub-rectangular section. The knife widens to the blade at the shoulders, where the knife has a maximum width (of 18.8mm), below which it narrows (for 20mm) before the blade edges appear to have been near-parallel sided (with a minimum width at the break of 8.9mm and a thickness of 1.5mm). The blade has a mid-ridge at the break, producing a lozengic section. Towards the top of the blade, the mid-ridge bifurcates to form a triangular panel, corresponding with the widening of the blade edge to the shoulders. The blade edge is damaged but blade facets are partially preserved on both sides. There is no clear evidence for blade damage that is contemporary with the use of the blade. The blade and tang now have a gentle bend across their length. The surface has numerous linear striations beneath the patina, running across both tang faces (at an angle of 20° – 40° to the vertical axis of the tang) resulting from coarse finishing. The blade have coarse, irregular striations running along the top of the blade and the suggestion of finer striations running off the blade edges. There is a possible punched mark at the top of the mid-ridge and a corresponding dent at the same position on the opposite face, suggesting that the blade was punched while resting on edge. The surface has a dark-green to black patina with a white deposit on the tang, concentrated around the perforation.   



Tanged and riveted knives are recovered in a variety of forms from the Middle Bronze Age onwards, though western British examples are not common. Studies (Pearce (1983), Knight et al. (2015) and Rowlands (1976, Pl.35)) illustrates two shouldered tanged knives with single rivet holes from Southern Britain, one from the River Thames, Berkshire, and another from Horningsea, Cambridgeshire. Rowlands considers tanged and riveted knives as belonging to the later Middle Bronze Age (Penard phase c.1275-1150BC). Comparable examples have been closely linked with Late Bronze Age material. Examples are present in the Grays Thurrock hoard, Essex (Turner 2010, No.02/134), and the Reach Fen hoard, Cambridgeshire (Smith 1956, GB.17 3(3) No.43), both of which are part of the Carp's Tongue complex in the Ewart Park phase (1000-800BC).

The casting jet is of two-runner type and is likely to be complete, after removing from the tool or weapon (with an overall length of 36.0mm and a weight of 91.4g). The upper face of the jet is sub-oval (37.8mm x 23.9mm) and has an undulating surface, as cast. The sides of the jet are divergent (to 12mm below the surface) before becoming more parallel sided (15.4mm thick). One of the runners is significantly larger than the other (18mm x 12mm compared to 9mm x 5mm) but both are similar lengths before being cut (14mm long).

1019089,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-750,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze palstave fragment of indeterminate type 



The cast looped palstave fragment has lost the blade, butt and loop and is represented by the stop fragment (with a surviving length of 46.6mm and a weight of 106.4g). The sides of the palstave are straight for their short lengths, either side of the breaks. The butt end is sub-rectangular sectioned at the break (17.8mm x 12.2mm), slightly concave across the width of the septum and has lost the flanges. One side has a prominent raised stub (giving a maximum surviving width of 26.4mm) from the remains of the loop. The stops are truncated slightly (with a height above the septum of 5 -6mm and a thickness of 24.0mm) and are straight and vertical. The top of the stops are bevelled to the blade, which is of sub-rectangular section at the break (20.9mm x 15.4mm), with convex faces, across their widths. There is the suggestion of ribs at the top of the blade faces but now lost to corrosion. Both breaks occurred in antiquity and the position of the breaks may suggest deliberate damage to the palstave. The surface is worn and corroded with a dark-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion.



The fragmentary state of the palstave makes typological identification indeterminate but the slender form with a loop would suggest Low Flanged.

1019111,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1500,"Blade fragment from a Bronze Age axehead of uncertain type, probably of Early Bronze Age date, c. 2000 – 1500BC



The cast axehead is fragmentary, represented by the blade and is comparatively small (with a surviving length of 32.3mm and a weight of 18.2g).The body is rectangular-sectioned at the break (with a width of 17.8mm and a thickness of 5.1mm) and the sides are straight and moderately divergent, before diverging more sharply to the expanded blade edge, now worn (with a blade width of 26.6mm).  The sides are heavily-corroded and pitted but there is the suggestion of a casting seam evident on both sides. The faces are largely flat, before converging to the blade edge with a discernible blade facet (7mm from the blade edge). There is a slight bend across the length of the blade, suggesting the axe was bent prior to breaking. The corroded and pitted surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright-green surface loss. 



The small and corroded blade fragment is difficult to identify in relation to typological features. The form is perhaps best paralleled with Early Bronze Age flat axes or Developed axe types and the narrow straight sided form and with a blade facet is suggestive of Developed types. The diminutive size may suggest an ‘axe-chisel’.  Flat and Developed axe types are associated with Metalworking Assemblages II – VI, corresponding with Needham’s (1996)[1] later Period 2 –to Period 4 but Developed types are of Periods 3-4, c. 2000 – 1500BC

1019114,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1200,"Copper alloy socketed fitting of uncertain function and date, possibly Bronze Age



The fitting is cast and is fragmentary broken in antiquity at one end (with a surviving length of 39.5mm and a weight of 38.6g). The mouth is irregular and sub-circular (with an internal diameter of 15mm – 18mm and a maximum thickness of 3.2mm) before a bulbous collar (with a maximum diameter of 26.3mm). The fitting gradually narrows before being near-parallel sided, gently convergent to the break (with a diameter of 16mm – 177mm). Immediately beneath the break are integral lugs now truncated (8mm -9mm long, 4mm thick with a surviving height of 2.3mm). The lugs had a circular perforation, suggesting both may have been loops. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a dark, olive-green patina and areas of pale-green surface loss. Where the surface survives, beneath the loops, there are irregular striations from finishing.



The identification and date of the object is uncertain. The looped lugs on opposite sides of a socket is similar to socketed spearheads of Early to Middle Bronze Age date, of Davis’ (2012) Group 2 – 7 of Arreton, Acton Park and Taunton Metalworking, corresponding with Needham’s (1996)[1] Periods 4 -5, and dated to c. 1700 – 1200BC. However a bulbous mouth on a socketed spearhead would be very unusual and is difficult to parallel. Additionally, the narrow looped lugs with thin circular perforations would by unusual.

The blade is fragmentary, represented by the incomplete butt and top of the blade (with a surviving length of 61.5mm and a weight of 40.0g). The butt is of irregular trapezoidal form and is thinnest at the end (with a maximum width of 45.6mm and a minimum thickness of 2.3mm). There are no obvious rivet holes surviving on the butt although a slight recess near the centre of the top edge may possibly be the remnants of a rivet hole. A central ridge is evident just before the end of the butt and develops as a prominent mid-ridge on the top of the blade. The butt is asymmetric, with three edges on one side and two on the other, although the maximum width of the butt from the central ridge is consistent on both sides. The butt both narrows and thickens to the top of the blade (with a width of 31mm and a thickness of 4.9mm). The blade narrows further towards the break (to 24.0mm wide and 5.2mm thick). The prominent mid-ridge along the blade creates a lozengic blade section. The blade edges have been lost on both sides. There are a number of striations running at different angles off the edges of the butt that appear to be preserved beneath the patina and are discernible on both faces. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of grey-green surface loss and bright-green corrosion.



The fragmentary state of the blade and loss of diagnostic features makes identification difficult. The trapezoidal butt form and prominent mid-ridge on the blade may tentatively suggest a Group II – III blade but the lack of rivet holes further complicates any identification. The butt is comparatively substantial, possibly suggesting a larger weapon, perhaps a Group III rapier ‘with damaged butt’. If the suggestion of a Group II – III blade is correct, then the weapon is likely to relate to Acton Park to Taunton metalworking, dating to c. 1600 – 1300BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,40,,,2.3,61.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Jeffreyston,SN0506,,51.71873558,-4.82439822,NMGW-455AE4,,201719new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/201719new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126209.jpg
1019120,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1900,"Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe of uncertain type, probably an axe-blank perhaps related to Type Migdale, c. 2,100 -1900BC



The cast flat axe is incomplete somewhat truncated and with considerable peripheral damage (with a maximum surviving length of 141.3mm and a weight of 356.0g) and has no developed features, comprising a sub-triangular bronze slab. The damaged butt is narrow and arched (with a width of 20mm and a thickness of 5.2mm). The sides are somewhat damaged but appear to be near-straight and divergent or gently concave, before widening more sharply near the blade (with a surviving blade edge width of 64.2mm and a thickness of 6.1mm) but not expanded. The straight blade does not have an edge and it is unclear whether the edge is truncated or was unworked. Both faces are flat (10.6mm 50mm from the blade end), although one face more so and suggests it was in contact with the mould during casting. The original surface has been lost and the surface is heavily-pitted and has a bright-green and light-brown corrosion. Damage at the sides (54mm) from the butt exposes a lamination running along the axe and evident from both sides and probably the result of the casting process. 



The axe has few diagnostic or developed features and has lost most of the edges, making any identification uncertain. The ‘as-cast’ face suggests that the axe is unworked and therefore may be interpreted as an axe blank. The general form with narrow butt and broad blade is perhaps closer to Migdale axe forms and suggests a contemporary date Visual analysis suggests the metal is a bronze, rather than copper but it has not been possible to scientifically test the alloy. If possible, analysis later may provide further evidence for the date of the axe.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,356,,,6.1,141.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,New Moat,SN0721,,51.8541318,-4.80382799,NMGW-457F5C,,2017159new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017159new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126210.jpg
1019121,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1450,"Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group I, Primary Shield Pattern type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981)[1] and of Acton Park 1 metalworking Industry corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 4 and probably dated to c. 1600 – 1450BC



The palstave is near-complete, missing the top of the flanges and with some surface damage (with an overall length of 157mm and a weight of 316.0g). The butt (with a width of 24.0mm and a thickness of 5.0mm) is straight and is slightly angled. The sides are straight and near-parallel to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 26.2mm, where the axe has a depth of 31.6mm). Below the stop (13mm below) both sides have a transverse rib or nicked-sides. The sides are moderately divergent beneath the nicks, producing a comparatively narrow and unexpanded blade edge (with a blade width of 52.0mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly finished. The flanges rise from the butt and have a straight top edge, the tops are now truncated but probably reached their maximum heights above the stop (16mm above the stop and with a maximum surviving height of 29.7mm). The septum is flat and is near-perpendicular to the flanges and stops (with heights of 11.4mm and 12.9mm). The stops have a slight curve across their width and are very slightly under-cut. The stops are also raised above the faces (with a height of 8.6mm and a thickness of 4.0mm - 6.8mm). The flanges extend onto the faces (for 20mm), before converging together as a shield moulding, enclosing a shallow depression. Both faces also have a midrib beginning below the stop and forming a trident decoration with the shield. The faces have a sub-rectangular section but slightly convex and with a midrib.  There is no obvious blade facet on the unexpanded edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina, which has laminated to a mid-brown surface above a green-brown surface.



This palstave does not closely correspond with the two subtypes proposed by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) but is closer to their Type Acton Park but is considerably smaller than most palstaves of the type and also has a trident decoration, rather than a shield.

1019123,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1600,"Blade fragment from an axehead of uncertain type and date, probably a Developed Flat Axe of Early Bronze Age date.



The axehead is fragmentary and heavily-corroded (with a surviving length of 52.5mm and a weight of 72.7g). The break occurred in antiquity and at the break, the axe body is slender and of sub-rectangular section (with a width of 22.3mm and a thickness of 8.9mm). The sides diverge moderately (for 24mm) before expanding sharply to produce an expanded blade edge (with a width of 50.0mm and an expanded edge length of 17mm). The faces are flat across their widths and also their lengths before a curved blade facet (19mm from the blade edge), positioned at the point where the blade is expanded. The edges of the faces appear to have slight ridges, seemingly the remnant ends of corroded flanges. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with no original surface surviving. But has a mid to bright green corrosion. 



The probable presence of flanges on the edges of the face would suggest the axehead was of a developed type. The fragmentary condition of the axehead makes further typological identification difficult and speculative. The slender body expanding sharply to a possible recurved blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 65-8)[1]. Developed Flat axes relate to Metalworking Assemblages IV -V and date to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, dated to c. 2050 – 1700BC. Type Bandon Axes probably relate to the Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V) with a proposed date range of c. 1900 – 1600BC.

1019124,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe fragment of indeterminate type and of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries dated to c. 1,150 – 600BC



The fragmentary cast axe is represented by a blade fragment only (with a surviving length of 27.3mm, a blade edge width of 50.6mm, a maximum thickness of 12.3mm and a weight of 44.6g). The base of the socket is evident at break and is rectangular form (38.7mm x 7.0mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 14.6mm). The axe has broken above the blade tips with no surviving blade side remaining on the fragment.  The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded but has a moderate curved edge (with a surviving depth of 12mm). The surviving blade face fragments are convex across their widths and slightly convex across their short surviving lengths. The surface has remnant patches of a dark-brown patina and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion. 



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base would imply a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries.

1019146,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of South Wales (Stogursey) Type and of Ewart Park metalworking industry dated to c. 950 – 750BC



The cast socketed axe is incomplete and damaged, missing the blade, an area of the mouth and is also perforation through one face (with a surviving length of 66.0 and a weight of 151.9g). The incomplete mouth is sub-rectangular to oval (48.5mm x 34.4mm (surviving)) and similarly the top of the socket is sub-rectangular (32.0mm x 26mm (incomplete)). The top of the mouth is moderately flat and has the suggestion of two, possibly three of the casting runner stubs, now corroded and worn. The mouth moulding is ‘lip-like’ and is short (5mm) and rounded. The loop springs from the base of the moulding (26mm long, 11.2mm high, 6.5mm wide) and is complete, enclosing a rounded D-shaped aperture (8.5mm x 6.1mm) with low casting flashes evident on the interior. The sides are near-straight for their surviving lengths, narrowing beneath the mouth before beginning to widen towards the missing blade, above the break (where the axe has a width of 40.0mm and depth of 13mm). The casting flashes are evident on both sides but are finished and rounded. The axe has broken above the socket base, leaving a slender oval aperture (24.0mm x 5.8mm) at the base. The sides of the axe are gently convex across the widths, giving the axe a near rectangular body section. The faces are straight and gradually convergent for the surviving lengths. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs and there is the suggestion that the face sides have also been enhanced to suggest ribs. Both faces were damaged during antiquity.  A pointed implement has been used to punch through the upper part of one face and the missing part of the opposite face is likely to be a result of the same action. Additionally, it seems likely that the blade has been removed. The surface is heavily-worn and corroded with a mid-green patina and may have been heat-affected, as evidenced by the coarse and crystalline-like surface condition. There is the suggestion of a black patina, partially preserved, possibly tenorite.



The damage on the axe appears to be deliberate, suggesting deliberate destructive treatment of the axe prior to deposition. Blade removal of the axe is unlikely to have occurred during normal use and experimental archaeology has indicated that an axe has to be heated to a high temperature to remove the blade, possibly resulting in the suggested heat-affected surface.   



The axe is of clear South Wales type but also has minor variations to the typical form, specifically the lipped mouth moulding, the suggestion of ribbed edges to the face and a more rectangular, rather than hexagonal body section.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,151.9,,,34.4,66,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Powys,Powys,Talybont-on-Usk,SO1123,,51.89841221,-3.29488981,NMGW-481C47,,NMWPA201942.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/NMWPA201942.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126301.jpg
1019150,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of uncertain type probably South Wales (Stogursey) or allied Type and of Ewart Park Metalworking, dating from c. 950 &ndash; 750BC

The cast axe is fragmentary, missing the mouth, one side and much of the faces (with a length of 78.1mm, a maximum surviving breadth of 26.2mm and a weight of 86.4g). The better preserved side has a small area of the mouth surviving, which is slightly out-turned (with a thickness of 4.8mm) with no discernible evidence for a collar moulding. The socket is of rounded rectangular form (with a depth of 60.9mm). The casting seam is raised, extenuated by a slight mismatching in the mould alignment but is neatly finished. The sides are moderately angled to the central seam, giving a sub-hexagonal body section to the axe. The side is straight along its length before a gentle expansion at the blade. The blade is very slightly expanded (with a blade width of 43.2mm) and has a modest curve (with a depth of 10mm). The original blade edge has been lost.&nbsp; The better preserved face (with a thickness of 2.9mm &ndash; 3.6mm) has a gentle convexity across both its length and width, with no blade facet evident. The face has the suggestion of parallel or near parallel ribs, now worn and corroded. The surface is heavily-corroded but there is a distinct black patina, possibly tenorite surviving over much of the external surface. Otherwise, the surface has corroded pale-green. 

The fragmentary condition of the axe, lacking the mouth makes typological identification uncertain. The general form, dimensions and ribbed decoration of the axe are all consistent with South Wales (Stogursey) Type axes of Ewart Park metalworking, c. 950 &ndash; 750BC. The heavily-patinated, possible tenorite deposits on the axe are of interest, possibly indicating a deliberate black colouring of the axe[1].

1019154,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1350,-1000,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze dirk with a Group IV blade of uncertain sub-type and of Penard metalworking industry dated to c. 1350 – 1000BC 



The dirk is incomplete missing the tip and with peripheral damage and is fragmentary, now in three fragments (with a combined surviving length of 186mm and a weight of 70.7g) in addition to the separate bronze rivet. The top edge of the butt is straight and has broken around one of the rivet holes (with a surviving width of 23.6mm and a thickness of 2.0mm). The surviving rivet hole is countersunk and circular (with a diameter of 5.7mm and a minimum distance between the rivet holes of 20.9mm) and an arc of approximately one-third from the damaged perforation is evident. The shoulders of the butt are eroded and damaged, now of uncertain form, one side is near-vertical and moderately straight, the other has the suggestion of widening before narrowing to the blade (with a maximum surviving width of 48.8mm where the butt has a thickness of 2.6mm), perhaps suggesting a butt of trapezoidal form. The top of the flattened midrib is evident at the base of butt, widest at its apex (at 34mm). The top of the midrib corresponds with a possible hilt mark, which appears straight and horizontal. There is also a straight horizontal mark on the opposite face but higher on the butt (14mm below the top edge, as opposed to 27mm). Both blade edges have been lost to erosion making the original form of the dirk uncertain. The flattened midrib is discernible along all of the surviving length and is widest at the top of the blade with straight convergent sides, becoming a narrow rib above the tip. The dirk reaches its maximum thickness (of 4.8mm) at its approximate mid-point, near the upper part of the central fragment. There is no decoration on the dirk. Striations are evident on the surface; there are deep vertical striations at the top of the butt, probably preserved from the finishing. Less prominent striations are evident running along the blade edge from sharpening. The surface has a dark-brown patina, with bright-green corrosion on damaged areas.



The rivet is near-ncomplete (with a length of 14.4mm and a weight of 1.7g), missing one end and has a slight bend. The surviving head is of sub-oval form (7.2mm x 6.3mm) and the shaft is of near-square section (4mm square) but with faceted corners. The surface has a dark-green patina



The erosion to the edges of the butt and blade makes typological identification uncertain, however the straight top edge of the butt, the two rivet holes, perhaps notched and the flattened mid-rib on the blade may suggest a Group IV blade, as defined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p. 62-112)[1]. The suggestion of a trapezoidal butt form, may suggest the butt was of ‘Archaic type’. Group IV blades are of Penard metalworking industry dated to c. 1350 – 1000BC

1019156,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-700,"Bronze Age blade, from a sword or rapier of Middle to Late Bronze Age date, c. 1300 – 700BC



The blade is incomplete and fragmentary, now in three conjoining fragments (with a combined surviving length of 418mm and weights of 146.7g, 130.3g and 15.0g (292g combined)). The upper fragment has broken through a central rivet hole (of 3.6mm diameter, now 7mm from the damaged hilt top). The blade is thickest (at 10.0mm) across its hilt and appears to have been of rounded, sub-rectangular section. The hilt has lost both sides and therefore the ricasso and beginning of the blade are not evident. On one face there is a clear change of patination from a green-brown dull patina to a dark-brown ‘glossy’ patina. The difference is straight with an apparent step towards the blade edge and may represent a hilt mark. The variable patina is not evident on the other face. The blade is of lenticular section, with a rounded midsection but with a clear blade facet, where it survives on one short section (20mm long, 144mm below the top, where the blade has a width of 27mm and a thickness of 8.6mm). The blade form cannot be determined because of the loss of the blade edges on both sides but there is the impression that the sword narrows before widening again and perhaps, tentatively suggesting a leaf-shaped blade profile. The blade appears to be narrowing towards the lower section and may have been approaching the tip. Despite the considerable peripheral damage to the blade, much of the surface is well-preserved with sharpening striations evident, mostly running along the blade but also diagonally off the blade. There are no grooves evident along the blade. The hilt has deeper short grooves below the patina. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of brown surface loss and powdery, pale-green corrosion. 



The extensive peripheral erosion has removed nearly all the diagnostic features, making typological identification difficult. The comparatively substantial and thick blade would suggest a sword rather than a rapier. Additionally, the surviving rivet hole would further suggest a sword, the earliest sword types which have central rivet holes through the hilt are of Balintober Type, of Middle Bronze Age date and Penard metalworking, c. 1300 – 1150BC but the hilt arrangement continues through the Late Bronze Age, of Wilburton and Ewart Park metalworking, and is also present on Gündligen Swords of Earliest Iron Age date and Llyn Fawr metalworking (c. 800 – 600BC). The majority of swords recovered in both Wales and Britain are of Ewart Park Type (c. 950 – 800BC) and the surviving features are consistent with the type. The extent of the erosion and damage may suggest that the sword was complete when deposited.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,292,,,10,418,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Merthyr Tydfil,Merthyr Tydfil,Bedlinog,SO1002,,51.70948966,-3.30395997,NMGW-49B5F1,,2017104new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017104new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126317.jpg
1019157,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1000,"Bronze Age bronze axehead, blade fragment probably from a Developed axe, cast flanged axe or palstave of Early to Late Bronze Age date, probably c. 1700 – 1000BC



The axehead is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 47.5mm and a weight of 98.0g). The break has occurred in antiquity and the axe is of sub-rectangular section at the break (with a width of 34mm and a thickness of 11.1mm). The sides are somewhat straight and divergent (for 20mm) before flaring outwards to the blade tips to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 52.4mm). Any casting seams on the sides are no longer evident, probably masked by corrosion and surface loss. The original blade edge has been lost and the blade edge is now asymmetric, differentially worn on one side and has a comparatively deep curve.  The blade faces appear moderately flat before converging to the edge, with a possible subtle blade facet (16mm from the edge). There is a prominent mid-ridge evident on both faces but more noticeable on the better preserved face. It is possible that the mid-ridge may be the distal end of a midrib but may also have had a consistent ridge along the length of the blade. The surface is partially preserved on one face with a dark-green to brown patina and has been lost on the other. There are a number of scratches or striations on the area of preserved surface and appear to be beneath the patina. 



The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification difficult, the central blade ridge suggests an axe of Developed Type or palstave blade, suggesting a the axe belonged to Arreton tradition at the earliest, dated from c. 1700BC to and probably through to Wilburton at the latest, c. 1000BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,98,,,11.1,47.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Caerphilly,Caerphilly,Darran Valley,SO1105,,51.7366159,-3.29025869,NMGW-49DA31,,2017150new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017150new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126318.jpg

The cast spearhead is incomplete, missing the base of the socket and the basal parts of both blades (with a surviving length of 103.3mm and a weight, including sediment in the socket of 78.0g).  At the break the spearhead is sub-circular sectioned (with a maximum diameter of 16.4mm) and the internal socket is sub-circular to oval (10mm x 11.5mm). The socket is considerably thicker on one side (5.0mm thick compared to 0.8mm) causing a weakness in the socket wall and probably resulting in the break. There is no evidence that the socket has broken through perforations for attachment. The damaged blades are present at the break across the socket (giving a surviving width of 19.5mm). The blades are largely damaged and truncated, surviving on one side (with a length of 51.6mm and a thickness of 1.6mm) and has a moderate convex curve to the tip. The blade edge is evident over short areas but has largely been lost. The socket is conical, gradually narrowing to the tip (where it has a diameter of 3mm). Striations are evident where the surface survives, running along the socket and adjacent blade. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a dark-brown patina and some patches of green corrosion.



The fragmentary condition of the spearhead where the diagnostic features have been lost, makes typological identification indeterminate. Socketed spearheads begin in Arreton phase towards the end of The Early Bronze Age and continue to the Ewart Park Phase of the Late Bronze Age. The form of the spearhead probably suggests that it is unlikely to be from the types found in the Arreton phase and is likely to date from Acton Park to Ewart Park, dated to c. 1550 – 800BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,78,,,16.4,103.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Willersley and Winforton,SO3147,,52.11699475,-3.00911745,NMGW-5B950C,,201943.jpg,bronze age socketed spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/201943.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126435.jpg

The palstave is near-complete, with minor damage to the blade edge and some surface loss (with an overall length of 166mm and a weight of 361.8g). The butt (with a width of 22.8mm and a thickness of 3.2mm) is straight and perpendicular to the sides. The sides are straight and slightly widening to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 32.4mm, where the stops have a height of 24.5mm) before prominent side mouldings or ‘nicked sides’ (giving a width of 36.5mm). The sides are gently curved along the blade, before flaring out to the blade tips, producing an  expanded and rounded blade edge, slightly damaged at the blade tips (with a blade width of 77.1mm and a blade depth of 22mm). The casting seams are barely evident on both sides and have been neatly finished, particularly on the sides of the blade. The flanges rise from the beneath the butt (17mm beneath) and have a gentle curve reaching their apexes above the stop (20mm above where the flanges have a height of 34.6mm and a thickness of 24.4mm at the stop). The septum is near-straight and slightly rounded across its width (33mm long and 18 – 19mm wide). The stops have a slight curve across their widths, are vertical sided (with a stop height of 8.4mm - 8.8mm and are raised above the faces (with a height of 4mm-5mm and a thickness of 5mm). A single rib extends from the stop on each blade face (for a length of 44mm and 49mm). The faces are slightly hollowed each side of the rib to suggest raised blade edges. There is a subtle rounded blade facet evident on both faces (19mm - 20mm from the blade edge). No obvious sharpening striations are discernible on the blade. The surface has begun to laminate at the blade edge and is damaged on one flange, otherwise the surface has a mid to dark-red brown patina.  



The palstave is of Early Midribbed Type and its broad form with subtle ‘flange extensions’ and prominent nicked sides, all indicate Type Chepstow, which corresponds to Acton Park metalworking and can be dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.

1019198,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-700,"Bronze Age spearhead, probably of Late Bronze Age date



The spearhead is fragmentary, represented by the top end but with the tip missing and has broken in antiquity (with a surviving length of 55.5mm and a weight of 42.3g). The spearhead has broken through the central circular socket (with an internal diameter of 11.1mm and a surviving depth of 19.6mm). The position of the socket is marked by a prominent, rounded midrib (with a width of 11mm, a height of 3mm and giving a maximum surrounding overall depth of 12.0mm). The midrib gradually narrows as it approaches the tip (with a width of 7mm at the break) but retains its height. The blade edges are lost but the surviving edges suggest they may have been straight and gradually convergent to the tip, producing a triangular form to the upper part of the spearhead. If the straight blade edge continued to the tip, some 49mm of the tip have been lost. The spear is solid at the upper break (with socket terminating 33mm below the break and with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 8.6mm). The blade edges had prominent facets, preserved over much of the blade. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running along the blade, partially preserved on both faces.  The surface is has a dark-green patina, possibly with tin surface enrichment in areas.

1019257,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-800,"A fragment of cast copper alloy spearhead of Middle to Late Bronze Age date (1400- 800 BC). The spearhead is broadly triangular in shape with both long edges and the tip well preserved. A strong narrow mid-rib is present terminating near the tip. The mid-rib does not divide the fragment evenly suggesting that the blades had been sharpened on a regular basis with one edge being worn away more than the other. Blade bevels on both long edges are present. The break is patinated suggesting that it is due to old damage rather than something more recent in the burial environment. It is possible that the break was a deliberate one prior to deposition when the weapon was ‘decommissioned’. This is more likely as the depositional landscape is dominated with streams and drained / improved wetland fields with poor drainage (further indicated by the iron staining from soil mineralisation / panning present on the lower blade). The blade is a mid-green colour with a well formed surface patina. A direct parallel and date cannot be attributed due to the undiagnostic nature of the fragment. It is most likely to be later Middle Bronze Age (1400-1150 BC) in form due to its strong lozenge sectioned.

1019373,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze tanged chisel, known as a trunnion tool, probably dating from 1500BC to 800BC



The trunnion tool is near-complete, heavily corroded with peripheral erosion (with a length of 164mm and a weight of 119.4g). The butt is narrow, thin and rounded (with a width of 9mm and a thickness of 3.9mm). The sides are straight and gradually divergent to the two trunnions. The chisel is thickest at the position of the trunnions (63mm  - 78mm from the butt, where it has a maximum thickness of 10.3mm). The trunnions are now of rounded form (giving a maximum width to the tool of 33.1mm, protruding by 2-4mm and are 15mm wide). The sides of the blade are also straight and divergent towards the blade edge, now eroded (with a surviving width of 21.5mm). The blade edge has been lost and the edge is damaged, longer on one side. One face of the tool is more convex across its length than the other and both faces are flat across their widths, becoming gently convex along the blade. The surface of the tool has largely been lost, with a pale, bright-green corrosion underlying a grey-brown corroded surface. There is one surviving patch of dark brown patina surviving on one face near the position of the trunnions. 



Trunnion tools are a long-lived form of chisel spanning from the Arreton tradition at the end of the Early Bronze Age (1700-1500BC) to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800BC) (Brailsford 1953, 34, Fig. 12[1]; Burgess & Cowen 1972, 169-74[2]). A number of trunnion tools have been recovered from along the northern Marches and in north-east Wales. Examples have been found in the Broxton (Cheshire), Ebnal (Shropshire) and the Meol Brace (Shropshire) hoards. The former was associated with two Group III low-flanged palstaves and a basal-looped spearhead dated to the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1275BC) (Davey & Forster 1975 Cat. 66[3],; Longley 1987, 96-103[4]).  The latter, associated with two transitional palstaves of the Penard phase. A rich hoard from Burton, Wrexham contained two palstaves of Transitional type along with a number of gold ornaments dating to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. (Gwilt, Lodwick & Davis 2004)[5]. Single finds of trunnion tools have also been made at Talerddig (Powys), Llandudno (Conwy) (Hemp 1925)[6] and Llangynog (Carmarthenshire)[7]. While some trunnion tools can date from the end of the early Bronze Age, most associated examples are recovered from hoards dated to the Middle Bronze Age.

1019383,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1800,"Early Bronze Age bronze butt fragment from an axe of uncertain type but of Flat or Developed Axe form 



The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end in antiquity (with a surviving length of 50.2mm and a weight of 51.0g). The butt end is evenly rounded (with a width of 20mm and a thickness of 0.9mm). The sides are straight and divergent for their lengths to the break (where the axe has a width of 28.0mm and a thickness of 8.6mm).  The axe butt has a near-rectangular body section, with one face flatter across its width than the other. There is no suggestion of flanges present on the fragment. The corroded surface is heavily-pitted with a dark-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion and surface loss. . The surface condition and patina suggest a bronze rather than copper composition, although it has not been possible to analyse the composition. 



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult and uncertain. The slender, rounded butt form, absence of flanges and the presumed bronze composition would be consistent with axes of Needham’s type 3 and in relation to Schmidt and Burgess (1981)[1] typology may have been of Migdale, Aylesford or allied types. Axes of these types are likely to be date to the Early Bronze Age, perhaps between c. 2200 – 1800BC.

1019391,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe, probably of South Wales (Stogursey) Type and of Ewart Park metalworking, dated to Needham’s (1997) Period 7, c. 950 – 750BC



The socketed axe is fragmentary, missing the upper part of the axe and the loop (with a surviving length of 58.3mm and a weight of 76.9g). The break occurred in antiquity and does not appear to have been the result of an evident weakness (at the break the axe has dimensions of 33mm x 23mm and with a maximum surviving socket depth of 43.6mm). One of the faces has impacted damage, forcing the face into the socket and possibly suggests deliberate damage. The other face has a crack extending from the break down the face (for 14mm).  The more complete side has the stub from the lower attachment of the loop. Beneath the loop the side is moderately straight, before flaring slightly to the gently expanded blade edge (giving a blade width of 39.00mm), slightly truncated. The blade edge has a shallow curve (with a depth of 9mm). The sides of the axe are bevelled towards the centre, where the casting seam is evident but has been neatly finished. The faces appear to have been moderately flat across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the blade edge. The faces were probably decorated with three convergent ribs and additionally sides of the faces appear to have been enhanced with ribbed mouldings. Deep striations are evident on the better preserved face, running diagonally from the blade edge and extending to the break. The striations appear to be beneath the patina and are too extensive to be sharpening striations. The surface is corroded and pitted with a dark-green patina and patches of bright-green corrosion.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,76.9,,,43.6,58.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llanarth,SO3721,,51.88398433,-2.91671538,NMGW-C33C2D,,20171562new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20171562new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126919.jpg
1019419,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Early to Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group I, Primary Shield Pattern type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981)[1] and of Acton Park metalworking Industry corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 4 and probably dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC



The palstave is near-complete, with some damage to the flanges (with an overall length of 138.3mm and a weight of 361.8g). The butt (with a width of 23.2mm and a thickness of 4.8mm) is near-straight lower at the centre. The sides are straight and near-parallel to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 15.8mm, where the stops have a height of 24.0mm and the flanges have a height of 27.9mm). The sides have a linear divergence along the blade, before flaring out to the blade tips, producing a moderately expanded and rounded blade edge (with a blade width of 55.0mm and a blade depth of 18mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly finished but there is no ridged or ‘nicked’ sides evident. The flanges rise from the butt and would have had a straight top edge but are now damaged, giving the suggestion of a rounded lozenge form to the sides of the axe.  The flanges reached their maximum heights just above the stop (16mm above the stop and with a maximum surviving height of 32.8mm). The septum is gently rounded across its width but near-perpendicular to the flanges and stops (with a maximum flange heights of 13.1mm and a stop height of 7.8mm - 8.6mm). The stops have a slight curve across their widths and both stops extend above the faces (with a height of 4.2mm and a thickness of 5mm - 6mm).Because of a hollowing at the top of the blade the flanges have the impression of extending onto the faces. Both faces have hollowing beneath the stop, although appearing rounded, related to a ‘shield’ form on one face and more squared on the other. There is the suggestion of a weak midrib on one face, through the shield-shaped hollowing and extending onto the blade (with a length of 36mm). No rib is discernible on the other face. There is a clear rounded blade facet on both faces (20mm from the blade edge). The surface is heavily-pitted with much of the original surface lost and with a dark-brown patina. The surface is magnetic, suggesting deposition within iron rich deposits, possibly boggy. 



The palstave is of an early form and has a depression below the stop rather than a shield moulding. The suggestion of a subtle midrib may indicate similarities to ‘Early Midribbed palstaves’. Primary Shield Pattern and Early Midribbed palstaves are likely to both be of Acton Park metalworking, dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.

1019424,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-900,"Late Bronze Age socketed spearhead of uncertain type, possibly pegged or side-looped, probably of Wilburton Metalworking, dated to c. 1200 – 900BC



The cast spearhead is fragmentary, missing the basal end and was comparatively large (with a surviving length of 141.0mm and a weight of 75.8g). The blade appears to have been of lozenge of kite-shaped form and has broken on one side near its base and on the other side near its widest point. The socket interior is evident at the break (with a maximum surviving depth of 114.6mm, ending 35mm from the tip) and there is also a blade edge facet discernible, suggesting the blade has broken at its start. There is no suggestion of a loop-hole, suggesting the spearhead was not of a Basal Looped type. The blade edge appears to widen with a linear edge (for 43mm, where the spearhead has a maximum surviving width of 42.5mm), the blade edge then has a near-linear convergence to the tip. The socket position is marked by the circular-sectioned midrib on the faces (with a thickness at the break of 1.0mm and a maximum depth through the midrib of 12.6mm), which gradually narrows and thins towards the tip. The blade wings thin slightly towards the edge (with a maximum thickness at the midrib of 5.0mm and a thickness before the edge facet of 3.4mm).  The stepped blade bevel or blade facet is preserved along much of the surviving blade edge (with a maximum width of 5.7mm). Some of the damage to the blade edge may be contemporary with its use but much of the edge, particularly the shorter side is more recently damaged. The surface is somewhat pitted and corroded with a dark-brown patina. Linear striations running along the blade wings are preserved beneath the patina. There is a bend just above the widest point of the blade but a loss of patina and green corrosion at the bend may suggest that the damage occurred more recently.



The absence of the socket makes typological identification uncertain and the lozenge or kite-shaped blade form is also a little unusual. The more commonly–recovered types consistent with the form of the fragmentary spearhead are pegged, of Davis’ generic Group 11 (2015)[1], or possibly of a side-looped type, Davis’ (ibid) Group 6, although the blade would seem to be too large for a Group 6 spearhead. Socketed Spearheads of Davis’ Generic Group 11 can be dated to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated by Needham et al (1996)[2] to c. 1200 – 900BC.

1019427,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-11500,-600,"Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe fragment of indeterminate type and of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries dated to c. 1,150 – 600BC



The fragmentary cast axe is represented by a blade fragment only (with a surviving length of 25.4mm, a maximum thickness of 11.5mm and a weight of 42.6g). At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket, now worn and corroded but probably of sub-rectangular form (29mm wide and with a maximum surviving depth of 2mm). Little of the either side of the axe survives (with a maximum surviving length of 18mm) but the short length are straight and divergent (producing a blade width of 44.9mm and a width of 40.8mm at the break). The blade edge is not expanded and has a gentle curve. (7.1mm deep).  The surviving blade face fragments are convex across their widths and near-straight across their short surviving lengths with no evidence for ribs present on the fragment. The surface is pitted with a corroded dark-brown patina and areas of green corrosion. There are probable casting flaws at the break, which are likely to have weakened the axe.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base would imply a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.

1019435,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axehead, probably of Ewart Park Metalworking and of Needham’s Period 7 



The cast socketed axe is incomplete, broken in antiquity and is missing the upper part of the body, including the mouth and loop (with a surviving length of 45.5mm and a weight of 51.0g). The axe body is of sub-rectangular section at the break (with dimensions 28.9mm x 16.4mm). The socket is oval sectioned (22.3mm x 12.8mm and 8.5mm deep). The wall thickness is variable, considerably thicker on the sides (at 2.6mm) compared to the faces (at 0.9mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel, before expanding sharply to the slightly recurved blade tips (giving a blade width of 38.9mm) and producing a curved blade edge. The casting seams are evident on both sides but have ben neatly fettled. There are no discernible ribs on the either face. There is a point impact depression immediately below the break on one face and a rounded indent at the break on the other face. Both faces are moderately straight and convergent before converging more sharply at the blade but with no obvious blade facet. The surface is pitted and corroded with a dark-green patina. 



The missing mouth makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively small size of the axe suggests that it is not of South Wales type but the form is consistent with axes of Ewart Park metalworking, dated to c. 1000 – 750BC.



The axe was reported with the socketed containing sediment which was removed at AC-NMW. At the base of the socket was loose organic fibrous deposits, possibly the remains of the wooden haft.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,51,,,,45.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llantilio Crossenny,SO4014,,51.82138675,-2.87191739,NMGW-C52206,,2017291new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017291new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126979.jpg
1019477,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Bronze Age bronze Early Short-Flanged axe, possibly of Type Bannockburn as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.76-7)[1] but of Acton Park 1 metalworking industry, straddling the end of the Early Bronze Age to beginning of the Middle Bronze Age; c. 1600 – 1400BC



The axe is complete with minimal corrosion and is comparatively large (with a length of 184mm and a weight of 678.7g). The butt is straight (with a width of 16.2mm and a thickness of 2.3mm) and is slightly angled across its width. The sides are straight and gently divergent as far as the ‘nicked’ ridges, below the stop (with a width at the stop of 32.9mm, a width of 35.8mm above the nicks and a width of 40.0mm across the nicks). Below the nicked ridges, the sides are concave and divergent to produce a splayed blade edge (with a blade width of 81.7mm). The blade edge has an even rounded curve. The casting seams are barely discernible and have been neatly and carefully finished. Beneath the nicks on the sides of the blade are decorative hammer facets.  The flanges are comparatively low, beginning at the butt and reaching their zenith just above the stop (with a maximum height of 25.2mm and a maximum height above the septum of 8.9mm) and continue onto the blade, ending at the position of the nicked ridges. The flanges are angled or bevelled inwards and converge slightly on the blade to incorporate the shield-pattern moulding. One of the flanges has an additional facet near its top edge not evident on the other three flanges. The septum (16mm long and 9mm wide) is flat and is near-perpendicular to the flanges and stop. There are hammered recesses and transverse ridges across the septum on both faces, immediately above the stop. The bar ledge stop is vertical (with a maximum height of 11.4mm above the septum and 7.3mm above the blade and is 3.3mm thick) and in side view, projects slightly above the flanges. The shield decoration is formed by a raised moulding and extends from the base of the flanges (with a length from the stop of 52mm). The blade is rectangular sectioned but the faces are gently convex across their widths. The blade faces are also convex across their lengths and convergent with no discernible blade facets. The blade appears to be more finished than are area within the shield, which shows hammer marks and casting flaws. Neither hammering facets nor sharpening striations are evident on the blade. The unpatinated surface has some pitting and some small patches of pale-green corrosion. 



The axe is of interesting form and should perhaps be considered as transitional between flanged axes and early palstaves. The long and low flanges extending into the shield pattern moulding, the faceted flanges and hammer-decoration on the nicked-sides are all features common to flanged axes. The axe form can be paralleled in an example recorded by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 77, pl. 55, no. 431) as Type Bannockburn. The prominent bar ledge stop however perhaps relates to primitive shield palstaves. Needham (1996, p 133)[2] and others have argued that there is considerable overlap for ‘final EBA and earliest MBA’ types and this axe form would appear to relate to this overlap of types.

The incomplete socket is sub-circular (with a maximum internal diameter of 13.5mm and an external diameter of 14.5mm - 15.9mm). The socket has a depth of 30, possibly with concretions or corrosion at the base. There is a subtle groove around the socket above the mouth (3mm above the socket). The sides of the socket are near-straight and gradually convergent. One of the loops is complete 



and is flat-topped of linear form (20mm long by 3mm wide), which begin 20mm from the socket mouth. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval (4.0-5mm long and 2mm high). Both sides have a ridge, running between the mouth and the base of the loop. Between the top of the loop and the base of the blade are five to six short horizontal incised lines, perhaps referencing or accommodating the binding. Only a small part of the blade survives (with a surviving length of 18.6mm and maximum surviving width of 45.6mm) but the gentle curve may suggest a leaf-shaped blade. The damaged blade edge with a blade facet is evident and survives on one side. Above the loop, the socket becomes increasingly oval-sectioned and defines a prominent midrib along the blade, as far as the break (with a thickness at the break of 9.5mm). The break occurred in antiquity and the socket (4.9mm diameter) is off-centre at the break (with a minimum thickness of 0.4mm). The spearhead has been neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is partially-preserved with a dark brown patina. Sharpening striations are evident beneath the patina running along the blade on the better preserved face. 





Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. A side-looped spearhead of Davis’ (2012) Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London[4], and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31)[5] to 1680 – 1400BC (with 95% confidence).

1019670,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"Middle Bronze Age bronze socketed spearhead of Davis’ (2012)[1] Group 6: Developed side-looped, unclassified (Greenwell and Brewis (1909)[2] Class IV (or socket-looped)) spearheads and of later Arreton, Acton Park, Taunton or early Wilburton metalworking (c. 1500 – 1100BC), of Needham’s (1996)[3] Periods 4-5 



The spearhead is incomplete missing the tip, much of the blade edge and with some damage to the socket mouth (with a surviving length of 150.1mm and a weight of 45.6g). The truncated socket is sub-circular (with a maximum internal diameter of 14mm and an external diameter of 17.6mm - 18.5mm). The socket retains some of the sediment and has a depth of 75, possibly with sediment or corrosion at the base. The socket has two clear ridges, which develop into prominent mid-ridges on along the blade. The sides of the socket have integral loops, only one of which survives and is flat-topped of linear form (13mm long by 3mm wide), which begin 28mm from the socket mouth at present. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval (5.5mm long and 2.8mm high). There is a weak ridge on both sides running from the loop to the blade, giving the top of the socket a sub-lozenge section. Only a small part of the blade survives (with a surviving length of 88mm and maximum surviving width of 5mm) but the slender convergent form may suggest a flame-shaped blade. No detail survives on the small fragment of surviving blade edge. The tip is missing and is likely to have broken in antiquity. The spearhead has been neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is partially-preserved but with the surface now flaking and with a mid to dark brown patina. 



Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. A side-looped spearhead of Davis’ (2012) Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London[4], and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31)[5] to 1680 – 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 – 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (Davis 2012, ibid. p 7). Most Group 6 spearheads however are likely to date from Acton Park and Taunton industries. Damage to the spearhead makes typological identification uncertain but the comparatively long and slender form with a suggested flame-shaped blade may suggest a Group 6C spearhead, which have a largely South-Eastern British distribution.

1019677,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy Socketed Spearhead with side loops of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1150 BC). The object has a leaf-shaped blade and is sub-circular in cross section with a central rib running down to the blade and extending into the shaft and socket. All edges of the blade have portions missing due to breaks and abrasion and there is a transverse break approximately half way down the length of the blade. The socket is circular and hollow and tapers in from the base to the blade. There are two loops on opposing sides of the socketed end, in line with the casting seams. These loops are slightly flattened on the outside to make them appear lozenge shaped. There is a break across the mid-section of the socket and loops. 



Length: 122.64mm, Width (socket): 13.34mm, Width (blade tip): 4.57mm, Thickness: 10.02mm, Weight: 32.1g



The metal is dark green in colour with areas of light green corrosion. The object has a predominantly smooth patina. 



A similar spearhead is illustrated by C. N. Moore and M. Rowlands (1972) in the Salisbury Museum Bronze Age metalwork catalogue (plate XI, no. 57) and recorded as Greenwell and Brewis Class IV. 



Similar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (1500 - 1150 BC).This object is therefore likely to be of a similar date.

1019766,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,600,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of indeterminate type probably of Ewart Park metalworking Industry, dated to c. 950 &ndash; 750BC but possibly of Wilburton-Wallington through to Llyn Fawr Industries, dating to c. 1,150 &ndash; 600BC

The axe head is fragmentary missing the upper part and is represented by approximately half of the original (with a maximum surviving length of 61.4mm and a weight (containing sediment) of 111.9g). The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 42.8mm and 13.2mm respectively). The axe is likely to have had a sub-rectangular section at the break but both faces are now dished as a result of battering the socket from both faces. The battering appears to have occurred at the base of the socket, although this cannot be demonstrated because of the sediment within the socket. The surviving part of the side is straight and near-parallel before diverging gently to a slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 47.9mm). The sides of the axe are rounded across their thickness with the casting seam evident running along the centre and neatly finished. The blade edge is comparatively straight, rounded near the tips. Both faces are dished beneath the break and suggest considerable force was applied; one face has a linear indentation from the more complete side, while the other face has a rounded depression. Beneath the break on one face is the base of a decorative rib, suggesting three parallel or near-parallel ribs. No ribs are now discernible on the other face. Beneath the impact damage on the blade, the faces are slightly convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facet evident. The surface is damaged and torn around the impact area but has mid &lsquo;olive&rsquo; green patina surviving elsewhere. 

The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 &ndash; 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form and ribbed decoration are likely to suggest Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC) and possibly of South Wales or allied axe type. The damage to the axe is deliberate, perhaps as an attempt to close the socket, as seen on other axes with deliberate damage.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,11.9,,,13.2,61.4,1,,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Peterston-super-Ely,ST0877,,51.4844426,-3.32633314,NMGW-076CC1,,20161251.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20161251.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127641.jpg
1019776,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1850,"Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe, probably of Needham’s Class 4 and probably relating to axes of later Class 3 or earlier Class 4. 



The axehead is complete with a broadly lenticular profile but with subtle bevels and is comparatively small (with a length of 91.2mm and a weight of 152.4g). The thin butt has a gentle curve (with a width of 19.5mm and a thickness of 2.0mm). One side is near-straight, slightly convex and diverging gently towards the bade (with a width at the top of the blade of 29.5mm), before diverging sharply to the recurved blade edge (with a blade width of 44.0mm). The other side has a noticeable bulge below the butt, giving the axe an asymmetric appearance. The blade edge was crescentic, now asymmetric, perhaps slightly eroded or worn on one side. The sides are convex across their thicknesses’ but without faceting and without a practical flange, although there appears to be a lip or low flange from the side-working. Although the faces give the axe a lenticular long profile, two curving bevels present: the median bevel is subtle and is positioned comparatively low on the axe (54mm from the butt and where the axe has a maximum thickness of 11.9mm). A more pronounced blade facet is evident (23mm from the blade edge). There are irregular incised marks on the blade, below the patina but unlikely to sharpening striations. The surface has a dark-green patina with some bright green damage on one face. 



The presence of a subtle median bevel, blade facet and ‘lip’ flanges all suggest early developed features, probably indicating an axe early in the sequence of class 4 or the last of Class 3 axes of the Mile Cross Assemblage. The dimensions and ratios do not correlate directly with Needham’s subtypes, although are perhaps closest to 3G, Type Knapton but do not closely confirm to the type. The form broadly corresponds with Type Aylesford, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess’s (1981, p. 60)[1] as a ‘primitive’ developed flat axe. The form would suggest a date at the earlier part of Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, probably dating to c. 2050 – 1850BC.

1019906,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze fragment, possibly of Bronze Age date but of uncertain artefact type



The fragment has broken on one end (with a surviving length of 47.2mm and a weight of 29.0g) and the other end is of irregular sub-rectangular section (13mm x 7mm) and is corroded and heavily-pitted. The sides of the terminal are straight and near-parallel as far as a stop (17mm from the terminal where it has a width and thickness of 15.0mm and 9.0mm respectively. Above the stop the sides are straight but more divergent to the break (with a width and thickness of 18.8mm and 7.0mm respectively). The septum is longer on one face (with a surviving length of 20mm and 24mm, a thickness at the break of 1.8mm and a maximum width of 12.5mm) and the side flanges end in a rounded stop. The stop is comparatively shallow on both faces (at 1.5mm). The surface is heavily-corroded with a dark-green patina preserved on the septum. 



The object has the flange and stop features in common with palstave axe types, generally of Middle Bronze Age date. It is possible that the terminal is incomplete and originally ended with a blade, perhaps suggesting a chisel or similar. If the end is relatively intact, it may be possible to suggest a small hammer that may have been hafted in a similar form to Middle Bronze Age palstaves and therefore earlier than socketed hammers. However flanged hammers of this form are difficult to parallel.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,29,,,9,47.2,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Longtown,SO3430,,51.96454255,-2.9620237,NMGW-56BFDE,,2017232new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017232new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127853.jpg
1019940,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-750,"Bronze Age blade fragment of uncertain type, probably from a rapier or sword of Middle to Late Bronze Age date c. 1500 – 750BC.



The blade is fragmentary, represented by a slender fragment, broken at both ends in antiquity (with a surviving length of 31.9mm and a weight of 18.1g). The blade has no clearly defined midrib and is of lenticular section of consistent thickness (of 5.8mm – 6.3mm). The blade is comparatively slender and both original blade edges have been lost. The blade edges were straight and convergent to one end (with a maximum surviving blade width of 20.4mm and minimum width of 17.8mm). The short blade fragment has a gentle curve across its length, with the suggestion of bending prior to breaking. The surface is very heavily-corroded and much of the original surface with a dark grey-green patina over red-brown areas of surface loss.



The fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively slender form of the blade may suggest that it’s derived from just above the tip of a sword although a rapier fragment is also possible. Rapiers date from the Middle Bronze Age while leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,18.1,,,6.3,31.9,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Cardiff,Cardiff,Pentyrch,ST0979,,51.50258281,-3.31245204,NMGW-587A08,,201738new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/201738new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127908.jpg
1019944,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1150,-600,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe mouth fragment of uncertain type and of Wilburton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries of c. 1150 – 600BC date



The axe is represented by a mouth fragment from the top of one face only (with a surviving length of 17.1mm, a surviving width of 30.8mm and a weight of 7.3g). There is a rounded protrusion on the top of the mouth where the mouth is also thicker (at 5.0mm, compared to 3.9mm), possibly the remnants of a casting runner stub, which has been well-finished. One end of the mouth has a slight curve and is likely to be approaching the axe side. The mouth has a lip above a moulding (9mm long), below which the tops of two ribs are evident immediately above the break. The axe is likely to have had three ribs originally. The lip at the mouth is also present on the inside of the socket but no other features are evident inside the socket.  The surface is heavily-pitted with a dark-brown patina. 



The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. Axes of Ewart Park tradition are more commonly recovered.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.3,,,3.9,17.1,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Steeple Ashton,ST2956,,51.29867918,-3.01975314,NMGW-58A358,,2017391new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017391new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127913.jpg
1019964,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1900,-1600,"Early Bronze Age developed flat axe of Needham’s Class 4 but of uncertain sub-type, probably dating to Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V), the later part of Needham’s (1996)[1] Period 3 to c. 1900 – 1600BC



The axehead is near-complete but has lost all of its surface, except at the blade edge and is a comparatively small axe (with a length of 80.5mm and a weight of 101.8g). The axe is likely to have had a lozengic long profile but the surface loss has eradicated any median bevel. The butt (with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 1.7mm) is straight and angled to one side. The sides are straight and near-parallel, gently divergent, before diverging more sharply at the blade (52mm from the butt, where the axe body has a width of 25.5mm). The blade is now asymmetric, differentially worn or corroded on one side. The blade edge is moderately expanded, producing a curved blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 38.2mm). The flanges appear to have begun just below the butt and probably reached their maximum heights around the midpoint of the axe (with a surviving maximum depth of 11.3mm and a height of 2.1mm), which was likely to have corresponded with the median bevel. The sides are convex across their thicknesses and there is the suggestion of a central ridge. The flanges are likely to have been hammered, rather than cast. The faces are now gently convex across their lengths, with no surviving evidence for a median bevel or for blade facets. The blades also have a gentle convexity across their widths. The surface survives near the blade edge with a dark-brown green patina. Sharpening striations running along the blade are discernible on one face. Elsewhere the surface has been lost and has corroded bright-green. 



The loss of surface detail makes typological identification difficult. The low flanges indicate a developed form and the straight butt and straight, near-parallel sides, only more divergent at the blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 65-8)[2], furthermore, its comparatively small size would seemingly indicate the variant Swinton.

1019969,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Bronze Age bronze early palstave or Early Short-Flanged axe, sharing features with Bar-Stop axes (Stegbeile) as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.89-90)[1] and of Acton Park 1 metalworking industry, straddling the end of the Early Bronze Age to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age; c. 1600 – 1400BC



The axe is near-complete but is heavily-corroded (with a length of 144.5mm and a weight of 321.7g). The butt appears slightly eroded and is of irregular shape (with a width of 20.4mm and a thickness of 4.5mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the top of the blade, to a point just below where the flanges end (where the axe has a width of 26.4mm). There is no suggestion that there was a side loop but there is the suggestion of possible nicking on the sides where the flanges end, although corrosion has removed any detail. Below the flanges the sides diverge more sharply to produce an expanded blade with a crescentic blade edge (51.3mm wide), damaged on one side. The sides are flat across their thicknesses. The flanges are truncated through corrosion or damage and begin just beneath the butt, rising with a gradual curve to reach a maximum height above the stop (with a maximum surviving height of 23.5mm). The flanges appear comparatively thin (at 2.5mm – 3.7mm thick) and are perpendicular to the septum.  The septum is flat across its length and has a gentle concavity across its width (with a thickness of 6.5mm, a length of 57mm and a width of 16mm – 18mm). The ledge stop is perpendicular to the septum (with a height of 11.0mm) and has a slight concavity across its width. There is a casting flaw at the base of the stop on one face. On one face, the stop projects above the blade faces, highest at the centre (5.1mm high) but near level to the blade at the sides and giving the impression of the stop being detached from the flanges. The stop on the other face (with the flaw) is less raised above the face and here the flanges are more damaged, making any distinction poorly defined. There is no shield pattern or midrib now evident below the stop, there is however the suggestion of a D-shaped depression at the top of the blade and it is possible to tentatively suggest an enclosing moulding, where the surface is better preserved on one face. The blade faces are subtly convex across both their lengths and widths with no discernible blade facets but giving a near-rectangular body section. There is a curved ridge evident on both faces (19mm from the blade edge) and is likely to define the position of a blade facet, now lost to corrosion.  The original surface has largely been lost but with occasional surviving remnants of dark-brown patina over the pitted, pale-green surface.



The axe appears to be somewhat transitional between flanged axes and early palstaves. The prominent bar ledge stop relates to ‘primitive’ palstaves, perhaps of Shield Pattern type, if the suggested shield-pattern decoration is correct. The separation between the stop and flanges, perhaps relates to Early Short Flanged axes and the suggested nicked sides would also be an early feature. The loss of more subtle details of the axe makes precise typological identification difficult. Needham (1996, p 133)[2] and others have argued that there is considerable overlap for ‘final EBA and earliest MBA’ types and this axe form would appear to relate to this overlap.

The weapon is fragmentary, represented by the lower part of the hilt and the top of the blade (with a surviving length of 67.1mm and a weight of 11.9g). The hilt has broken through a rivet-hole, positioned off-centre (with a diameter of 4.2mm). The hilt has a lenticular section at the break (2.0mm thick at the break and 3.2mm thick at the shoulders), becoming lozengic at the shoulders. The sides of the hilt are moderately straight and diverge slightly towards the shoulders (with a width at the break of 12.6m and 15.0mm above the shoulders) and both sides appear to have been blunted (with a thickness of 1.3mm). The shoulders are expanded (where the blade has a maximum width and thickness of 16.9mm and 3.4mm respectively). Below the shoulders, the blade narrows sharply to produce a rapier type blade profile (with a width and thickness at the break of 6.0mm and 1.6mm respectively). The top of the blade has a defined mid-ridge, with the suggestion of a flat-topped ridge near the break. The original blade edge has been lost and it is now uncertain whether any of the damage relates to its contemporary use.  A curve at the break indicates that the blade was bent prior to breaking. The surface has surviving remnants of a mid-brown patina over a darker-brown corrosion



The comparatively long hilt with central rivet placement does not correspond with typical wide and trapezoidal butted dirks and rapiers, usually secured with side rivets or notches. The blade width is also unusually slender. The fragmentary condition of the weapon makes a definitive identification problematic, however it is possible to suggest that the weapon was reworked from an earlier blade.

1020012,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of Ewart Park Metalworking Industry, dated to c. 950 &ndash; 750BC

The axehead is complete and is a comparatively small example (with a length of 62.6mm and a weight of 86.6g, including sediment in the socket). The mouth is oval (33.0mm wide and 27.4mm deep external and 23.8mm x 17.8mm internal). The top of the mouth has a lip-ridge from casting and appears to have been a four-runner casting, now with two stubs evident. The collar is rounded and bevelled to the face. The loop springs from the base of the moulding and is of rounded, sub-lozenge section (with a length of 21mm, 9.0mm internal, 4.8mm wide and 4.3mm thick). The sides are moderately straight and near-parallel (with a width below the loop of 28.2mm) before diverging sharply to produce an expanded and curved blade edge (with a width of 37.6mm). Both sides have a clear ridge from the casting seam, which has been neatly finished. The casting seam on the unlooped side is notably flattened opposite the loop, perhaps from the binding. The blade edge has some post depositional damage. Both faces are decorated the three converging ribs, with the side ribs beginning at the corners of the faces. The faces are convex across their widths and also have a gentle convexity across their lengths, before converging sharply below a blade facet (19mm from the blade edge). The body of the axe has a rounded, sub-rectangular section. Sharpening striations are evident on both on faces, running along the blade. The surface is corroded with a patchy dark-brown patina over a mid-brown surface.

The ribbed socketed axehead with no moulding beneath the collar and probable four-runner casting is likely to indicate an axe allied to the South Wales (Stogursey) type. However, the axe is considerably smaller than would be expected and also has a rounded body section with a blade facet and recurved blade, which are all features atypical of the type.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,86.6,,,27.4,62.6,1,,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Pont-y-Clun,ST0681,,51.52006907,-3.35619487,NMGW-5AB6F2,,20161491.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20161491.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1128016.jpg
1020095,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Copper alloy blade, probably corroded remnants of an Early Bronze Age dagger



The leaf-shaped blade is truncated and heavily-corroded (with a surviving length of 47.9mm and a weight of 6.1g). The butt is evenly-rounded, giving the blade a maximum width at the base of the blade of 18.9mm). There are small rounded indents beneath the start of the blade edge, possibly remnants of rivet notches to secure the handle. The butt is thinned (with a minimum thickness of 0.8mm) and reaches its maximum thickness (of 2.5mm) near the midpoint of the blade. The butt is flat across its width, while the blade appears to have had a rounded central ridge. The original blade edge and tip have been lost. The surface is very-heavily pitted and has a pale to mid-green patina.



Metallurgical analysis was undertaken[1] using X-Ray fluorescence, which demonstrated the alloy is a tin-bronze with trace elements of iron, lead, zinc and arsenic detected.

1020257,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1600,1450,"Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group I, Primary Shield Pattern type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981)[1] and of Acton Park 1 metalworking Industry corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 4 and probably dated to c. 1600 – 1450BC



The palstave is near-complete, with some damage to the blade edge (with a length of 145.9mm and a weight of 475.5g). The butt is moderately straight and undulates slightly (with a width of 24.5mm and a thickness of 3.1mm). The flanges end just below the butt and rise to their highest point above the stop (with a maximum depth of 36.6mm and a maximum height above the septum of 14.5mm). The flanges have a slightly convex profile across their widths. The septum is concave across its width and the stop is of bar ledge form and is near-straight (with a maximum height above the septum of 12.5mm and 14.4mm). The sides of the palstave are straight and near-parallel, slightly divergent as far as the stop (with a width of 30.4mm), below which, they gradually become more divergent before expanding sharply to the splayed and recurved blade tips, now slightly damaged(producing a blade width of 62.0mm). There are subtle transverse ridges or ‘nicks’ on the sides below the stop (where the blade has a width of 32.2mm). The blade edge is asymmetric, partly through wear but with some damage at the centre. The casting seams are discernible but appear to have been carefully removed and finished on both sides. The flanges extend onto the top of the faces, flanking a central hollowing below the stop. The hollowing is coarse and unfinished but has a broadly ‘shield-pattern’ form. The axe faces are flat across their widths and their lengths before converging more sharply below a blade facet (17mm from the blade edge). The blade edge is corroded, with no surviving evidence for sharpening striations. One of the blade faces has striations running up the blade evident above the facet but beneath the patina, possibly finishing marks. The surface has a mid to dark-brown patina, largely preserved but damaged at the blade.





The palstave demonstrates the characteristics of Primary Shield Pattern palstaves, but has a shallow depression rather than a moulding for the shield-pattern. This example with the recurved blade edge, slender body and of a smaller size the many Acton Park type examples, would suggest Type Colchester as defined by Schmidt & Burgess, (1981, p. 117).

The axe head is fragmentary missing its upper part and is represented by approximately half of the original (with a maximum surviving length of 56.6mm and a weight (containing sediment) of 143.6g). The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 42.3mm and 22.3mm respectively). The axe has a sub-rectangular section at the break and is of variable wall thickness (1.8mm – 4.3mm).  The surviving parts of the sides are straight and near-parallel before diverging gently to a slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 48.3mm). The sides of the axe are rounded across their thickness with the raised casting seam evident running along the centre and finished. The blade edge has a gentle curve, rounded near the tips. There is the suggestion of a central rib on the more complete face. The faces are slightly convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facets evident. Both faces have deep striations running diagonally along the entire surviving lengths beneath the patina. The surface has dark-green patina surviving elsewhere. 





The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form and suggested ribbed decoration are likely to suggest Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC) and possibly of South Wales or allied axe type.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,143.6,,,22.3,56.6,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Goetre Fawr,SO3205,,51.73956157,-2.98620223,NMGW-9B610B,,2016183.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2016183.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1128787.jpg
1020400,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age bronze blade fragment from an axe of indeterminate type, probably of Early or Middle Bronze Age date



The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade end only and has broken across its width in addition to its length (with a surviving width of 51.1mm, a surviving length of 31.5mm, a maximum surviving thickness of 10.7mm and a weight of 73.0g). The break occurred in antiquity and there is no socket base evident on the sub-rectangular body section. The surviving side fragment is convex, widening to the blade tip, now truncated but indicating an expanded blade edge. The original blade edge has been lost but the current edge suggests a moderate curve (with a depth of approximately 14mm). The side is widest at the edges, possibly as a result of hammering. The blade faces have a slight convexity across both their widths and lengths but with no obvious blade facet. The original surface has been lost and the current surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-green to brown patina.



The fragment condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain.

The tip is rounded and worn and a central, raised midrib runs vertically down the middle of both sides of the blade. There is a worn break at the base with knicks and worn areas on both edges of the blade. The fragment has lost all its diagnostic features and so the classification cannot be further refined.

1020432,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Copper tanged gouge of uncertain date possibly Bronze Age 



The cast tanged gouge is complete (with a length of 86.2mm and a weight of 24.7g). The tang is pointed at its apex ad below is square to rectangular sectioned, with straight sides gradually diverging towards the blade (reaching a maximum thickness of 5.6mm at the top of the blade, where the gouge has a width of 9.8mm). The sides of the blade are also straight and diverge more markedly to the blade edge. There are no lugs or mouldings on the sides. The blade edge is straight (with a width of 23.4mm and, a depth of 4.2mm). The flute gradually both deepens and widens along the blade (with a length of 37mm). The surface is heavily-corroded and is stripped to the red-brown metal with traces of pale to dark-green patina. 



Metallurgical analysis was conducted on the gouge using X-Ray Fluorescence and suggested that the metal composition is largely copper. 



The gouge is of an unusual form and cannot easily be paralleled in Bronze Age metalwork. Gouges generally are of socketed form and date to the Late Bronze Age. Very few tanged gouges are recorded, with one of the few instances in the Carlton Rode (Norwich) hoard[1] of Ewart Park metalworking, although the examples are of significantly different form, being slender and collared. Tanged chisels are easier to parallel and also date to the Late Bronze Age but also generally have a collar or side lugs. Simple ‘chisels’ of similar form have been recovered, including the ‘axe-chisel’ from Llandyfan (Anglesey) associated with an Early Bronze Age Food Vessel urn (Savory 1980, no. 334)[2]. The suggested copper composition would be very unusual for Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts and if Bronze Age, a Late Bronze Age date may be expected for the gouge. Therefore it is perhaps unlikely that the gouge dates to the Bronze Age but cannot be discounted.

1020460,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe probably of Needham’s Class 3 axes but of uncertain subtype



The axehead is incomplete, missing the butt end and with some truncation to the blade tips and edge (with a surviving length of 93.6mm and a weight of 199.2g). The axe is rectangular-sectioned (with a width and thickness at the break of 28mm x 10.0mm), with no suggestion of hammered flanges or developed edge features on the intact areas of the edges. The sides are straight and divergent before expanding more sharply to the blade tips, now damaged and truncated (with a surviving width of 69.1mm). The original blade edge has been lost (with a minimum thickness at the blade edge of 3.2mm) and the current edge is comparatively straight with a shallow profile, although the original edge was likely to have been deeper and with at least a moderate curve. The blade faces are flat across their widths and the blade becomes more convergent but there is no discernible facet and there is no median bevel evident. Hammering marks are evident on the blade and there is the suggestion of a blade facet (7mm deep from the current blade edge) with sharpening striations running along the blade facet. Large areas of the surface survive with a dark-green to brown patina, elsewhere the surface has a pale-green corrosion. 



Metallurgical analysis was conducted on the axehead using X-Ray Fluorescence and suggested that the metal composition is a leaded bronze. 



The fragmentary and truncated condition of the axe makes detailed typological identification uncertain. The lack of any developed features but the bronze composition would suggest a Needham Class 3 axe and generally perhaps corresponds to the Migdale type as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981)[1] of Metalworking Assemblage III and dated to c. 2200 – 1900BC.

The socketed axe is fragmentary, missing the mouth and one face (with a surviving maximum length of 104.0mm and a weight of 234.0g) and was damaged in antiquity. The more complete face is likely to have broken just below the mouth but with no mouth moulding surviving. The socket has a moderately consistent rectangular profile (29mm x 19mm and with a surviving depth of 67.5mm). The longer side has the stub of the loop surviving just below the break (with a surviving height of 9.0mm). The sides are near-straight, gently convex and divergent before a moderate out-turning at the blade tips (giving a blade width of 54.3mm). The sides are perpendicular to the faces and straight across their thickness. The casting seams are discernible and were finished but the detail has been removed through corrosion. The blade edge has a slight curvature with some damage. The faces are gradually convergent with no blade facets and have a shallow convexity across their length and are near-flat across their widths, producing a rectangular body section (with a maximum surviving body width, below the loop of 38mm). The faces were decorated with vertical parallel ribs and the more complete face appears to have had 6 ribs, with the two outermost ribs following the edges of the face. Striations are evident running between the ribs.  The surface has a dark-brown patina partially preserved, with pale-green corrosion elsewhere.





The missing mouth makes any typological identification uncertain, the form and size of the axe would suggest the axe type to be a Southern English ribbed axe, which Needham (1990, p 32)[2] called Class B and if the axe also had a double-mouth moulding may have been similar to his B1 axe but with a less expanded blade edge. Southern English ribbed axes are not commonly recovered from South Wales and together with occasional Carp’s Tongue components in Ewart Park hoards, perhaps begin to suggest a degree of contact between western and South Eastern Britain at the start of the 1st millennium BC, which may be observed proportionately less in South Eastern Wales.

The axe is represented by one corner of the blade (with a surviving length of 20.0mm, a surviving blade width of 28.8mm and a weight of 13.1g). The axe has broken in antiquity, at a position just above the base of the socket (with a surviving depth of 6mm, where the axe has a thickness of 9.9mm, the faces have a thickness of 2.8mm and the side if 5.5mm thick). A small length of the side survives, which is flat across its thickness with a raised but hammer-finished casting seam running down the centre. The blade tip is prominent and out-turned. The blade edge has a moderate curve for its surviving length. The blade edge has impact damage (5mm long), probably contemporary with is use or breakage, adjacent to the break.

The axehead has been damaged and is incomplete missing its mouth and loop (with a maximum surviving length of 88.9mm and a weight of 232.8g). The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 43.0mm and 27.6mm respectively, a surviving socket depth of 60.9mm; a face thickness of 2mm – 3mm and a side thickness of 3mm – 5mm) and has a sub-rectangular section at the break, with a stub on one side, presumably from the loop. One face and part of the side have been hammered inwards, over the socket and suggests deliberate contemporary damage. The sides are near-straight parallel before diverging more sharply to an expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 55.0mm). The sides of the axe are bevelled towards their centre, where the raised casting seam is evident running along the centre. The casting seam has been neatly hammer-finished. The blade edge has a moderate and even curve. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, with the central rib slightly more pronounced.

The flat axe is incomplete with considerable peripheral damage surface loss and likely truncation at the butt (with a surviving length of 89.7mm and weight of 121.98g).  Although damaged the axe appears to have a lozengic long-profile. The original butt does not survive (but with a surviving width of 15mm). The better preserved side is unusually straight for its preserved length (of 43mm) and is bevelled towards its mid-axis.  There is the suggestion that the side may be beginning to curve outwards before the surface has been lost. The side of blade faces have a slight lip for the flange and corresponding hammer facets are discernible on the sides.  The original blade edge has been lost (with a surviving blade width of 35.8mm) and the original form is no longer evident. Both blade faces have a clear median bevel, which has a gentle curve and is positioned close to the damaged butt end (32mm from the butt where the axe has a maximum thickness of 12.0mm and a surviving width of 25.3mm), producing a lozengic long-profile. The blade faces have a gentle convexity across their both their widths and lengths, with no discernible blade facet. There are striations running along the blade near its end, suggesting only a slight loss to edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of powdery grey-green corrosion. 



The unknown scale of truncation to the axe, particularly the butt makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively high position of the median bevel would suggest that the butt end may be significantly eroded. If the current very narrow and straight-sided form of the axe, is representative or near-representative of its original shape, then the axe would perhaps suggest a Class 4 axe-chisel. The axe may possibly be of similar form to Developed Axes of Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 65-7)[1] and if correct may correlate to Needham’s Class 4E.

1020801,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1800,"Early Bronze Age bronze butt fragment from an axe of uncertain type but of Flat or Developed Axe form 



The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end in antiquity (with a surviving length of 28.1mm and a weight of 23.1g). The butt end is rounded at the corners and is moderately straight (with a width of 25mm and a thickness of 2.7mm). The sides are straight and divergent for their short lengths to the break (where the axe has a width of 30.5mm and a thickness of 6.0mm).  The axe butt has a sub-rectangular body section, thickest at the centre and with no suggestion of flanges present on the fragment. The corroded surface has been stripped to brown metal with remnants of the mid-green. The surface condition and patina may suggest a copper rather than bronze composition, although it has not been possible to analyse the composition. 



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult and uncertain. The butt form, absence of flanges and possible copper composition would be consistent with axes of Needham’s type 1 and in relation to Schmidt and Burgess (1981)[1] typology may have been of Ballybeg /Roseisle or allied types. Axes of these types are likely to be date to the Early Bronze Age, perhaps between c. 2200 – 1800BC.

The socketed axe is incomplete, missing the upper part of one face and side and the loop and is comparatively small (with a length of 52.6mm and a weight of 56.9g). The mouth is incomplete, with a little less than half surviving and appears to have been sub-rectangular (with surviving external dimensions of 33.0mm x 24.5mm and internal 22.6mm x 14mm, with socket depth of 40.0mm). The surviving part of the top of the mouth is irregular and two of the probable four casting runners are evident. There is a slight lip discernible at the mouth, above the rounded mouth moulding (with a length of 6mm and a depth of 4mm - 6mm). The loop springs from the moulding, just above the break and the stub of the lower return is evident (giving a loop length of 18.6mm). The sides of the axe are moderately straight, before diverging to the slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 33.2mm). The blade edge is largely straight (with a depth of 4.4mm) with minimal expansion. The sides of the axe are bevelled towards the centre, where the casting seam is evident but has been neatly finished. The faces appear to have been flat across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the blade edge. Both faces display evidence of damage from battering, possibly deliberately and the battering on the fragmentary face is likely to have removed its upper part. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, convergent on the complete face and near-parallel on the incomplete face but with irregularly placed. The blade edge has a distorted lip on the incomplete face, possibly from impact and is also suggestive of abuse.  The surface is corroded with a dark-green brown patina where it survives and elsewhere has corroded pale to mid-green.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,56.9,,,,45.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,,Swansea,Swansea,Pennard,SS5587,,51.56318393,-4.09328584,NMGW-1C82A7,,20172439.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20172439.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1130340.jpg

The axehead is near-complete, missing the loop (with an overall length of 107.5mm and a weight of 436.0g, including some sediment in the socket). The flat-topped mouth is sub-oval (56.8mm x 50.3mm) with a sub oval socket (36.9mm x 32.4mm and with a maximum depth, containing sediment of 41mm). Three of the four casting runner stubs are evident on the face but have been carefully removed. The mouth moulding has a prominent lip on most of one face but the other face has the usual bevelled-steeped moulding. The sub-circular loop (with a length of 37mm) springs from the moulding on one side and has broken just above the moulding. Both breaks on the loop appear to be recent. The sides have a gentle concavity long their lengths and are bevelled to the centre across their thicknesses. The casting seams are clearly discernible but have been neatly finished. The sides diverge to the gently expanded blade edge (with a width of 58.0mm), which has a very gently curvature. The original blade edge has been lost. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, which descend from the moulding and continue for most of the faces (with a length of 66mm). Additionally the edges of the faces are raised, suggesting further ribs. The faces are otherwise gently convex across their widths and near straight across their length, before converging more sharply at the blade, below the ribs but with no blade facet. Hammer facets are discernible on both blades. The surface has a dark-green patina and traces of probable tenorite survive on the upper part of the faces and along the length of both sides. 



There are crude incised marks on both blades, lying beneath the patina and seemingly deliberate, the marks generally extend from the ribs, including the sides and end before the blade edge. There are addition incised marks running across the blades crossing the verticals. Some of the marks are doubled in areas, suggesting a secondary attempt on the same alignment and implying a deliberate design was attempted. A number of sharpening striations are also evident running both along and perpendicular to the blade edge.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,436,,,,107.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South West,Gloucestershire,Forest of Dean,St. Briavels,SO5505,,51.74188522,-2.65313695,NMGW-1D56C4,,2017110new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017110new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1130095.jpg
1020916,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age bronze butt fragment from an axe of uncertain type but of Developed Axe or Palstave form 



The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end (with a surviving length of 15.6mm and a weight of 8.4g). The butt end is comparatively straight with some damage and thins to a blunt edge (with a width of 19.0mm and a thickness of 1.5mm). The sides are straight and slightly divergent for their short lengths to the break (with a maximum width of 24.4mm and a thickness of 4.7mm). The sides are rounded and convex across their thicknesses with the suggestion of a finished casting seam on the corroded and pitted surface. The flanges begin just below the butt and are just emerging before the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 7.2mm with a height above the septum of 1.3mm). The break occurred in antiquity. The surface has a dark-green patina with patches of pitting and corrosion. 





The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with slender-butted Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981) from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,8.4,,,4.7,15.6,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Fyfield and Tubney,SP4100,,51.69725659,-1.40818013,NMGW-2E8EC1,,2015111.jpg,Bronze Age Palstave or developed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2015111.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1130025.jpg
1021081,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group III, Low Flanged, Broad Blade form and possibly of Sleaford variant type, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p136) [1].



The palstave is near-complete, missing much of the loop the butt-end and a blade tip and is a small example (with a surviving length of 106.5mm and a weight of 173.1g). The butt is damaged (18.5mm wide and 3.7mm thick), now pointed at the centre but is unlikely to have been much longer. The sides are straight and near parallel to below the stop (where the axe has a width of 19.9mm below the loop). The sides of the blade are divergent with a moderate curve before diverging more sharply to the blade tips, one of which is lost (giving a surviving blade width of 42.1mm). The blade edge has a moderately deep curve (with a blade depth of 15mm). The sides are flat across their thickness with the casting seam clearly evident but neatly finished. The loop is damaged (with a length of 18.8mm, a maximum thickness of 6mm and a surviving height of 5.6mm) and positioned near the position of the stop. The flanges are truncated but appear to have begun at or below the butt and have a linear top edge, reaching their maximum height at the stop (where the axe has a thickness of 25.6mm). The septum (with a surviving length of 39.5mm, a width of 14mm and a thickness of 5.5mm) is flat across its length and gently concave across its width. The stop is also gently concave with near vertical sides (with a height of 10.4mm). The faces are bevelled from the top of the stop to the face and are decorated with three ribs, a prominent linear central rib, flanked by weaker side ribs, curving from the edge of the sides towards the central rib before petering out by the mid blade face. The curved converging ribs perhaps suggest a trident variant design. The central rib extends all the way along the blade, reaching the prominent blade facet (12.6mm long). The original surface with a dark-brown patina has been lost over much of the surface and is fragile with a tendency to flake. 



The palstave is of unusual form, particularly in relation to its small size but also with the curving ribs. The form may be best paralleled in Low-Flanged palstaves, perhaps a variant of Type Sleaford, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p136). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1500 – 1150BC.

1021087,Wedge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,,,"Lead axe-shaped wedge, possibly a miniature votive axe of uncertain date, possibly Bronze Age to Roman



The axe-shaped object has been hammer-shaped and is complete (with a length of 28.7mm and weight of 8.1g). The butt is thickened and of rectangular section (8.4mm wide and 5.2mm thick). The sides are straight and divergent before flaring to the expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 16.6mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The faces are somewhat irregular but generally flat and gradually convergent from the butt to the blade. There is no applied decoration to the object.



The wedge-shaped piece of lead has few diagnostic features, making any identification speculative and uncertain. The expanded blade edge is similar to axes of Bronze Age and later date, however a rectangular-sectioned block, hammered at one end would produce a similar ‘blade’ profile. The thickened squared butt is best paralleled in shaft-hole axes of Iron Age and later date but there is no suggestion of attempts to represent a shaft-hole. While miniature votive axes are recorded, these generally are of copper alloy and often represent socketed axe forms. Copper alloy shaft-hole axes are known, generally of Roman date but often include the handle in the representation.",,4,Lead,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,8.1,,,,28.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llancarfan,ST0773,,51.44832263,-3.33967676,NMGW-81C2E4,,miniature.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/miniature.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1130390.jpg
1021201,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 8.8 mm (thickness: 2.5 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (5.6 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 19.7 mm (thickness 2.0 mm).



It measures 48.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 19.7 mm, width at the butt is 8.8 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 5.6 mm. It weighs 18.5 grams.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

1021286,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group I, Primary Shield Pattern type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981)[1] and of Acton Park 1 metalworking Industry corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 4 and probably spanning the end of The Early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 – 1400BC).



The palstave is near-complete but heavily corroded and eroded at the edges (with a length of 124.2mm and a weight of 245.4g).  The butt (with a width of 24.6mm and a thickness of 4.8mm) is damaged and its original form uncertain. The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the position of the stop (where the axe has a width of 27.2mm and a thickness of 18.1mm). The sides of the blade have an even and gradual curve to the now damaged and eroded blade tips (with a maximum surviving blade width of 49.4mm). The sides are corroded and no transverse ribs, or ‘nicked-sides’ are evident.  The original blade edge has been lost but suggests a moderately deep curve (with a depth of 17mm). The flanges are truncated but appear to have low, beginning from beneath the butt and reaching their maximum heights (with a surviving height of 17.4mm and a maximum height above the septum of 5.5mm) above the stop. The septum is straight and flat across both its length and width and has a few small casting flaws. The stops are vertically sided and slightly concave (with a height of 5.5mm). Corrosion has removed much of the surface detail on the blade faces but there were depressions below the stops, suggestive of the shield-pattern. It is also possible to suggest a midrib, indicating a trident design. The blade faces have a gentle convexity across their widths and are straight but gradually convergent across their lengths, with no obvious blade facet surviving. The original surface has largely been lost with remnants of a dark-brown patina and elsewhere is pale brown with patches of pale green corrosion. 



The corroded surface has removed much of the diagnostic detail but the palstave appears to be of an early form, with a depression below the stop rather than a shield moulding. The suggestion of a subtle midrib may indicate similarities to ‘Early Midribbed palstaves’. Primary Shield Pattern and Early Midribbed palstaves are likely to both be of Acton Park metalworking, dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.
