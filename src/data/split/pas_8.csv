1059451,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1000,-700,"An complete cast copper alloy socketed axehead. The mouth of the socket is square with a thick exterior beaded collar around it. The body of the blade tapers from the mouth towards the blade in one plane, whilst it flares in the other into a curved, crescentic cutting edge. At one side, below the collar, is a large side loop on the longitudinal axis. The loop is D-shaped with an oval aperture. There are clear casting lines along the sides of the axehead. The sides of the body have two longitudinal facets flanking the casting ridges, giving the body an irregular hexagonal exterior profile. On one side (the one without the loop) there is pitting on the surface, perhaps as the result of slight mis-casting.

1059938,Votive Model,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1000,-500,"A copper-alloy wheel probaby a Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age votive model of a miniature wheel dating c. 1000-500 BC.



The openwork wheel is circular in plan and sub-rectangular in cross section. The wheel has a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate, narrowing as they do, before flaring slightly where they join the outer rim. The apertures between each spoke are sub-oval and slightly pointed. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle (c.1.0mm diameter) this shows signs of ware on one face. The wheel has a dark green surface with red areas. 



Measurements: external diameter: 20.48mm; thickness: 2.23mm and weight: 2.17g. 



There are many similar examples recorded on the database which are recorded as late Bronze Age or early Iron Age/Roman votive wheels e.g. OXON-5C8F8B; GLO-E82DE1, KENT-70F063, SF-987EE3; NMS-1CDC66. However, this example has a very small central perforation and rectangular cross-section more akin to NLM-B563BC, which suggests it is the wheel for an 18/19th century toy cannon.  An example of an 18th century toy cannon with its wheeled carriage in (Forsyth and Egan 2005, page 85 no. 1.17); has similar wheels but notably with only three spokes rather than four. SUR-A965C0 is another example recorded as a toy on the PAS database, but again with three spokes.

1060880,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete miniature flax axehead or chisel dating to the Late Bronze Age c.1150-800 cal BC.



The object has a very narrow butt that is slightly rounded, 3.7mm wide and 1.5mm thick. From this point it widens in a smooth concave curve down its length to reach it maximum width of 23.7mm at the blade's corners. The blade corners are damaged such that it is not possible to say it they were rounded or out-turned. The blade is a shallow crescent shape and is bevelled possibly suggesting it has been sharpened although the edge now is abraded and chipped. The axe is lenticular (a pointed oval) in cross section reaching it maximum thickness (3.1mm) approximately half way along its length. It's sides are very slightly upturned into almost imperceptible flanges. There is a casting floor close to its centre which exaggerates their size.



The object has a dark green patina which is chipped in pieces where it has a medium green patina.



The object is 43.7mm long, 23.7mm wide, 3.1mm thick and weighs 6.8 grams.



There are several very similar objects recorded on the database described as either chisels or miniature axeheads (LIN-9CD5CA, LEIC-90F47D,  BH-5D8656, WAW-353C3E, IOW-C695CB, SOM-589161). Many Late Bronze Age chisels share a similar form to this example although these often have projecting collars at their midpoint which this lacks however an example of a chisel from Netherhampton in the British Museum Collection (1998,0901.172) shows how these need not always be present. A similar find is also illustrated from Priory Farm Cave (Savory 1980, p.179, 265 nr. 2). As such a Late Bronze Age date and suggested use as a chisel is appropriate for this object. It should be noted however that while copper alloy woodworking tools are known from the Bronze Age such tools continue in use to the Post Medieval period for finer woodworking.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2022-03-06T00:00:00Z,2022-03-06T00:00:00Z,,,6.8,,,3.2,43.7,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South East,Buckinghamshire,Wycombe,Bledlow-cum-Saunderton,SU7999,From finder,51.68421301,-0.85868259,OXON-ECB45F,,OXONECB45F.jpg,Bronze Age chisel,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXONECB45F.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1178329.jpg

The fragment is triangular in plan, tapering to the spear's point. It has a lozenge shaped midrib that is solid and runs to the point of the spear from which the flat blade edges of the spear extend these narrow in width to meeting the point. The fragment has a dark green patina that is chipped away in places. 



The fragment is 24.2mm long, 14mm wide, 8.5mm thick and weighs 5.1 grams.

1060978,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1600,"A near-complete cast copper alloy developed axehead of Needham’s Class 4E (Type Whittington), dating to the early Bronze Age, probably specifically to the Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V), c. 1900 – 1600BC. Needham’s Class 4E (Type Whittington) relates to Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 65)[1] and probably dating to Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V), the later part of Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, c. 1900 – 1600BC.



The axehead is near-complete, missing only the cutting edge of the blade, the blade tips and part of the butt. There is no decoration visible on any of the axe’s surface. The axe has a lozenge profile with a stop ridge, a damaged straight butt and near-straight, gently diverging sides. The sides only start to diverge more strongly until well below the stop ridge, at which point they flare strongly to produce a heavily expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 64.2mm). The curvature of the sides and the quite strongly curved blade edge is slightly asymmetric, with one of the blade tips more expanded than the other. 



The sides of the axe are convex and undecorated- the flanges stand upright and are not beveled inwards compared to the septum; the flanges stand a maximum of c. 2mm above the septum. The sides are smooth where the original surface remains- any trace of casting flash has been carefully removed. The stop bevel is straight and subtle (with a maximum thickness of 11.2mm excluding the flanges). 



The axe has undergone chemical degradation but is still in relatively good condition. The majority of the original surface remains, with a dark brown patina. The original surface is smooth and even glossy in some patches, preserving some toolmarks including sharpening striations on the blade. There are patches of rust-coloured corrosion product on the original surface. Degradation has led to the delamination of the original surface, which has likely lost much of its copper content and is in a fragile state. This has led to the loss of areas of surface, revealing a light grey powdery core underneath. Cracks in the original surface suggest that this delamination is affecting much of the object. Areas where the surface has been lost entirely include one corner of the butt and a section of adjoining side, parts of the flanges, and one blade tip as well as the entire blade edge.



This axe clearly fits into Needham’s Class 4E (Type Whittington)/Type Bandon: it is comparatively small with a straight butt, a clear stop ridge, straight and near-parallel sides producing a narrow mid-blade, below which it curves sharply to form expanded blade tips.

It is rectangular in form, partly hollow, tapering from an oval mouth to a vertical cutting edge. It does not have the usual loop, instead it has a circular hole through the upper part of the blade itself, perhaps to allow it to be suspended and worn.



Dimensions: 13.2mm in height; 14.1mm in length; 8.5mm thick; 5.1g in weight



This resembles Robinson's Type IVa 'Miniature axes with parallel vertical sides - essentially square' (nos. 16-18), although as the edges flare a little it also has some similarity with Type IIb 'miniature axes with an expanding straight sided profile - short stubby axes' (nos. 8 and 9). Robinson does, however, note that no. 9 of Type II can be compared with no. 18 of class IV, and, therefore, Type IV is suggested for this miniature axehead. Similar objects on the database are WILT-669E9D and WILT-B9731D, which both exhibit the same sub-square form as this example.



The dating of miniature axeheads is from the late Bronze Age to Roman periods, but they are more common from the Roman period. Robinson dates no.18 to the Roman period, although does not give an explanation for this dating. No. 16, however, was found with a hoard of Bronze Age and Iron Age objects. A wide date range is therefore suggested for this example.



Miniature socketed axeheads possibly functioned as amulets or votive offerings (Robinson 1995, 60).

1061674,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A fragmentary cast copper alloy axe head of Late Bronze Age date. The type is uncertain, but probably South Wales (Stogursey) Type of Ewart Park metalworking industry dated to c.950-750 BC, but possibly of Wilburton-Wallington through to Llyn Fawr industries dating to c.1150-600 BC. 



The axehead is represented by the end of the blade only with a straight transverse break across its width resulting in a surviving length of 32.3mm. The break happened in antiquity and is likely evidence for deliberate breakage of the object prior to deposition, or ‘ritual killing’. The width at the break is 33.2mm (11.8mm thick) with traces of the hollow ovoid socket surviving (internal dimensions of the remaining socket 23mm x 6.9mm ). The sides are bevelled toward their centre with casting seams running along their surviving centre, terminating c.6.6mm before the blade edge. One casting seam has been damaged by corrosion, but the surviving seam suggests that it was finished. The blade edge has a slight expansion and possibly uneven curve, although damage to the original surface makes it difficult to tell for certain. The blade edge has a medium curvature (max width 36.3mm) with some damage to the original surface edge. The faces of the axe are gradually convergent and very slightly convex with the end of a single raised rib decoration preserving on one face (surviving rib length 7.8mm from the break). Some striations from sharpening are suggested, mostly concentrated on one face. The surface has a dark brown patina with areas of damage revealing bright green bronze corrosion beneath. The fragment weighs 39.72g.



The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form indicates a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form, scale and ribbed decoration suggest the axe to be of South Wales or allied type and of Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC). The inward hammered at the break would suggest deliberate damage prior to deposition.

A similar arrowhead is recorded in database record SUR-D9AFD8, where Dr Simon Maslin notes:



Bronze Age flat barbed and tanged copper-alloy arrowheads are known from Britain, though they are rare finds.

This appears to be the fourth recorded example from Wiltshire.



In contrast there is only one example known from a secure British Bronze Age archaeological context (the Penard hoard, Archaeologica 71, page 138). At the time of its discovery, it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import on the basis of a range of previous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France. PAS recorded finds have since demonstrated that these bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age, the Penard find was dated to 1275-1140 BC, suggesting at least a Middle Bronze Age date for copper alloy examples such as this one.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,4.4,,,3.05,34.41,1,Ellie Cox,Ellie Cox,Eastern,Cambridgeshire,South Cambridgeshire,Meldreth,TL3846,From finder,52.09514038,0.01308184,NARC-7ED438,,NARC7ED438.jpg,NARC-7ED438 : Arrowhead : Bronze Age,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC7ED438.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1180058.jpg

A moderate double twist at a point where the rod is bent appears to be a deliberate feature, but elsewhere very slight twists are likely to be due to distortion. There are no cut-marks, nor any crushing at the breaks.





Maximum dimension (in contorted state) 55 mm; approximate extended length 200 mm; thickness 2.5 – 3.1 mm; weight 14.4 g","In its fragmentary state it is difficult to definitively identify the Risby-cum-Roxby object. Twisting is a regular feature of Middle Bronze Age gold bar ornaments in Britain and Ireland, and in general this may offer the best context. Although most commonly of square section, such ornaments can occasionally have a triangular section (Eogan 1994, 53-7). Also unusual is the intermittent nature of the twisting, but very occasional parallels can be found. It is possible that intermittent twisting may in some cases indicate that an ornament had not been finished. The hoard from Cappeen, Co Cork, is particularly relevant to the Risby-cum-Roxby fragment in containing these two unusual features, albeit on separate objects: a fully twisted neckring of triangular section and an intermittently twisted bracelet, or rod, of square-section (Eogan 1994, 63 fig. 27A).



This can be accepted as a probable fragment from a Bronze Age ornament, although not necessarily from a finished piece. Consequently, in terms of age and as the item contains a minimum of 10% gold it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

A complete and well crafted penannular bracelet with a band of thin, ‘C’ section. The section is, however, thickest at the centre, thinner, rounded and highly polished along the edges. The band tapers gently towards the squared off terminals, which are defined by a narrow beading created by turning the metal outward slightly. 



The bracelet has many dents and scratches visible under magnification. Slight compression of the band around the middle has caused limited distortion and misalignment of the terminals. One of the latter is damaged by a small nick.



Diameter 78 x 67 mm;  width band at terminals 15.5 mm;  maximum width band (undistorted) 18.5 mm;  thickness edges c. 0.7 mm;  weight 47.3 g



Bracelet 2



A complete and highly polished penannular bracelet with band of near ‘D’ section, but the inner face is marginally hollowed. The band tapers gently towards either end then expands into oval, buffer-like terminals with flat ends; the expansion is slightly asymmetric, bulging externally. There are many tiny dents and scratches visible under magnification.



Diameter 68.5 x 54 mm;  width band 7.0 – 5.5 mm;  thickness band 4.3 – 3.2 mm;  terminals 8.5 x 6 mm, 8 x 6 mm;  weight 53.1 g","Both may be compared with Late Bronze Age styles of bracelet, but of very different types. No 2 is the more regular type and is widely distributed in Britain. Bracelet no 1 is much more unusual; its closest British parallel is a new find from Donhead St Mary, Hampshire, which is a reworked bracelet slightly thickened at the terminals rather than out-turned (Treasure case 2005T1). A group of three C-section bracelets in a hoard from Matignon in Brittany are similar (Eluère 1982, 181 fig.169). The Tisbury hoard, Wiltshire, includes two bracelets again with broad C-section bands, but these have large tongue-shaped terminals very different from the vestigial ones at Gisburn (Eogan 1994, pl.11 nos 4&5). 



In addition to having an unusual form, bracelet no 1 has an unparalleled composition. Taking account of the specific gravity of the piece and the preferential loss of copper at the surface due to corrosion, the scientific work makes it clear that this object had either an extremely low gold content throughout, or a thickish coating of gold around a base-metal core. Neither of these compositions has been encountered in Bronze Age goldwork before.



These two bracelets broadly conform to types known in the Late Bronze Age of Britain and north-west Europe, one (D-section) being more common than the other. Certain typological details and the composition of bracelet no 1, however, cannot as yet be matched among Bronze Age metalwork. Without cutting a section for full metallographic analysis, it is not possible to be more specific about its internal composition, but even the surface composition is highly unusual.

1063661,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1150,"Circumstances of discovery: Four Bronze Age bronze implements were found during a metal-detecting rally. Three have been reported as potential Treasure; the fourth, made by a different finder, should also be submitted for consideration. The three submitted were located at depths between 1 and 4 inches (2.5 &ndash; 10 cm) on cultivated land. They were found in an approximate line at intervals of about 25 feet (8 m) &ndash; hence 50 feet overall. The alignment was noted to be that of the direction of ploughing.

Descriptions: Condition of the palstaves (nos 1 &amp; 2) is good, the socketed axe, less so. Deep green to blackish patinas are largely intact, but there is scattered pock-scarring.

1. Looped palstave: Patina intact over part of butt and much of flange crests; cutting edge and blade tips totally corrosion chipped. Flanges triangular; stop projects beyond a little and has convex-profiled underside. Stout trident-rib motif &ndash; the outer ribs slightly bowed and point of convergence low on blade; stem below is diffuse. Strong edge bevel with slight blade tip hollows. Hammer-dimpling on faces and sides.

Extant length 154 mm ; extant width cutting edge 51.7 mm; breadth at stop 36.8 mm; width butt 24.5 mm; thickness septum base 12 mm; thickness edge bevel 12 mm; depth edge bevel 18 mm; weight 485.5 g

2. Looped palstave: Butt corner intact &ndash; adjacent notch may be due to poor casting. Two flanges intact, two corrosion damaged. Stretch of cutting edge retains patina, but is rounded rather than sharp. Flanges convex-triangular in shape; stop projects beyond a little and has convex-profiled underside. Stout trident-rib motif &ndash; the outer ribs slightly bowed. Strong edge bevel, hammering having caused blade tip hollows; however, tips have then been neatly squared off in finishing. Some hammer rippling, especially on edge bevel.

Extant length 149.5 mm; width cutting edge 47.8 mm; width butt 24.5 mm; breadth at stop 32 mm; thickness septum base 11.5 mm; thickness edge bevel 12.8 mm; depth edge bevel 11 mm; weight 418.8 g

3. Socketed axe: Half of one face and of one side missing - ?eaten away by corrosion. Cutting edge and blade tips totally corrosion chipped. Flat deep mouth-moulding. Corroded lump on one side of moulding, 4 mm across, likely to be stump of a loop. Both faces and sides have convex profile, but they still meet at well defined body angles. Intact side shows light linear features parallel to fine central casting flash remnant. Inner edge of mouth top also carries thin casting flash. Diffuse edge bevel. Socket tapers steadily and asymmetrically to wedge-like end.

Extant length 111 mm; extant width cutting edge 37.6 mm; extant width mouth 33.8 mm; breadth mouth 29.5 mm; depth socket 79 mm; weight 217.9 g.

Discussion:&nbsp;Of the three submitted objects, the two palstaves are of the Transitional type typical of the Penard metalworking assemblage, circa 1275 &ndash; 1150 BC. The socketed axe is an early flat-collar form; it does not have the gracile proportions of the Taunton-Hademarschen axes and instead is entirely in keeping with Penard socketed axe styles. A good parallel may be found, for example, in the Wallington hoard, Northumberland (Burgess 1968, 13 fig. 9.14), now datable to the Penard phase.

The three reported bronzes can therefore be attributed to the same phase of the Bronze Age and could well have been deposited at the same time. Although well separated, their linear alignment admits the possibility that they were plough dispersed from close proximity to one another.","It is likely that the objects form a single find of Middle&nbsp;Bronze Age&nbsp;date, which&nbsp;qualifies the group&nbsp;as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002).",3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2004-09-01T00:00:00Z,2004-09-30T00:00:00Z,2004T401,,1122.2,,,,,3,,,Eastern,Norfolk,King's Lynn and West Norfolk,Thornham,TF7343,,52.95647202,0.57396722,BM-297D6C,,00064445_001.jpg,"Middle Bronze Age base-metal hoard, looped palstave, Thornham, Norfolk, Treasure, 2004T401, no1side",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mrainbow/00064445_001.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1181232.jpg

Description: The butt end is rounded. The flanges begin about a third of the way along the butt's length. The cleft between the flanges is relatively smother perhaps from use. There is a significant casting fault in one side of the butt, rectangular in shape. The casting seem is visible along the sides of the axehead, though some effort to reduce it appears to have taken place. The stop is pronounced and overhangs a little which accentuates the wasting effect of the blade's flare. The stop has right-angled corners with the flanges. The loop is on one side which arcs over the position on the stop. The blade is long, thin and narrow and extends extensively before flaring out at the blade end. There is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade.



The axehead is has a heavily mottled patination. Within the flanges it has a dark grey-green patination, towards the butt end and along the flanges it has a much lighter green-white corrosion cause by wear and corrosion. The blade end is a medium mid green colour. There are some areas of historic damage across the blade indicated by their patination.

Edward Caswell comments: At the broadest interpretation this could be the blade of a palstave or a flat axehead dating c.2400-1150 cal BC. Being a bit more risky I’d lean towards palstave and probably a later variety due to its width (c.1400-1150 cal BC) based on the dimensions and blade shape, but that’s very much a feel thing based on the ones I’ve seen.



Peter Reavill comments: I agree with Edward Caswell but I might be even more cautious and suggest that it is a tool blade, given the narrow width and thicknesses involved. With those dimensions I wonder if we might be dealing with a tanged chisel. The break is noteworthy - from the profile it has either been used as a lever and broken through use (the equivalent of using a screwdriver to open a tin of stubborn paint) or possibly more likely, evidence of deliberate destruction.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2022-01-01T00:00:00Z,2022-01-31T00:00:00Z,,,111.6,,,11.2,46.8,1,Jenny Durrant,Jenny Durrant,South East,West Sussex,Chichester,Lurgashall,SU9330,From finder,51.06181564,-0.67426599,HAMP-3DEA84,,HAMP3DEA8402.jpg,AXEHEAD - An incomplete Bronze Age copper alloy axehead.,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/HAMP3DEA8402.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1204118.jpg
1063914,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1900,"A complete but worn, decorated Early Bronze Age developed flat axehead dating to c.2000-1900 cal BC.



The axehead has a narrow butt (c.27mm wide) which has a rounded terminal. From this point is widens in a smooth concave curve to its point of maximum width and its blade tips (c.83mm). The blade is a shallow crescent shape and appears to have been bevelled on one side from sharpening. The opposite surface’s patina is too chipped to determine whether it too was sharpened or whether the blade has marks from use.



The axehead is lozenge shaped in profile thickening from its butt and blade to a proto stop bevel that is placed c.69mm down its length from the butt. The bevel is shallow but clearly visible.



Both surfaces of the axehead have traces of worn incised decoration. On both sides this consists of incised dashes placed in a zig zag lines running down the length of the blade creating a shallow transverse herring bone design. These lines fill the width of the body where they are placed. On the least damaged surface this pattern is visible from 43.6mm after the butt and ends 56mm before the blade. The opposite surface may have covered a similar extent but is too pitted, chipped and worn to be certain.



The axehead has a glossy light green, sometimes brown patina that is abraded and chipped in several places.



The axehead is 170mm long, 83mm wide, 12.8mm thick at the bevel and weighs 419 grams.



The dimensions of this axehead have been recorded following the protocol established by Needham (2017). The ratios of these dimensions match that of class 4C Type Mount Pleasant and whose depictions match the form of this example. This form is suggested to date to c.2000-1900 cal BC (Needham 2017: 26).","Appendix 1: Measurements to Needham’s (2018) specifications and associated ratios

1063942,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete copper alloy, tip from a spearhead, probably of Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1500 to c. BC 1150.



The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a blunt point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There are traces of small sides loops. There is damage to both edges of the blade.



It measures 59.8 mm in length, 14.2 mm wide (base), 11.6 mm wide (tip) and 11.8 mm thick. The walls are 2.5 mm thick. The side loops are 14.6 mm long by 3.0 mm wide. They extend 2.5 mm away from the body of the spear head. The socket has a surviving depth of 53.7 mm. It weighs 18.5 g.



The spear head is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



This object has lost most of it's diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult. However similar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including SWYOR-1F74C1, SF-C557DC and WMID-270D2F.

1063976,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-1500,"Fragment of the blade end of a Bronze Age axehead, probably a flat axehead. The cutting edge is convex and complete, apart from a small fragment missing from a non-recent break. At the other end the object terminates in a non-recent transverse break. The side edges are transversally convex and longitudinally concave as they flare out to meet the tips of the cutting edge. The axehead is necessarily thicker at the break than at the blade. Viewed side-on, the edges taper convexly to meet at a point at the cutting edge.



The surface of the metal is patinated dark and mid-green, and is also notably crazed (covered with a network of fine cracks) on both faces and side edges, probably as a result of burning. The cracks on one face are patinated bright green. On the face of the transverse break there are traces of red-brown patination. c. 2350-1500 BC

The socket is oval in&nbsp;cross section and measures 23.76mm in width. The object tapers in&nbsp;thickness from its socket to a flat &#39;blade&#39; end that is sub-triangular in form and measures 43.35mm in width,&nbsp;with one side diagonal and one side straight, now broken,&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;that this end widened outwards either side to form a trapezodial or crescentic shape. The patina is a green - dark green in colour with some areas of lighter copper-alloy corrosion which fits with an earlier Bronze Age date.&nbsp;

The object is highly unusual and very rare. There are no comparable axes in the corpus of axes covering northern Britain by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and neither are there comparable socketed chisels in the corpus of woodworking tools in southern England by Lee (2014). However, Eogan (2000, 215-16 and Plate 111) highlights the few examples found in Ireland with one parallel with the provenance only of &quot;County Armagh&quot; being the closest (No. U15).. A similar object can be seen in&nbsp;SUSS-CA3F71 which is dated to the Late Bronze Age. Similar objects have also come up in hoards from&nbsp;this period. See&nbsp;LANCUM-A5AF1B object number 5 for a similar comparison from a Late Bronze Age hoard from Lancaster.&nbsp;

1065444,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-801,"Copper-alloy awl, probably of late Bronze Age date. It is circular in cross-section for just over half its length, and then flattens to a rectangular cross-section. The circular-section area&nbsp;tapers gently and smoothly from 5.0mm in diameter in the centre to 3.8mm in diameter at the end, which has a worn break. The rectangular-section area maintains the width, flaring slightly to 5.4mm,&nbsp;but flattens to 1.5mm thick at the blunt, perhaps incomplete, chisel-like end, which is slightly curved&nbsp;in the direction of one of the larger faces. This bend has not caused any stress to the metal, so may be original. The object is in good, relatively unworn condition with&nbsp;a dark green patina and crisp, sharp arrises.

*( To nearest 5g.)","Background to Discovery. 





In 1947 a local farmworker found a looped and socketed axehead whilst engaged in agricultural work. The location is approximately 2 kilometres SW of another the LBA hoard found in the 1990s. 



     The find was reported to a local historian, who recorded the axehead. Subsequently this gentleman facilitated the donation of the axehead to Colchester Museum, which acquired it in 1961, accession no. 280.61. The museum has since lost the find.



     At some time in the 1990s, the historian directed a local metal detectorist, to the location and with the consent of the landowner a metal detector search was made of the area. A further complete axehead together with several fragmentary ones and a number of ingot pieces were consequently recovered. Subsequently the detectorist died, and no further searching of the field was carried out. It is however believed that treasure hunters also accessed this field, and thus it is probable that diagnostic metalwork has been removed without record.



     Of the pieces that do survive, and which are detailed in the following catalogue, it is clear that the find represents another of the now ubiquitous Ewart Park Phase scrap hoards. It should be noted that the material as shown to the writer was loose in a box with other metal detector finds, and with nothing to indicate the original association of any of the finds. All that were clearly or apparently of LBA date were outsorted, but it follows that the items illustrated are only presumed to be associated and a part of the same deposit. 





LBA Hoard Catalogue, Earlier Finds





001. Axehead, socketed with loop. 140g.* 111x48x32. Plain mouth, slight chamfer to edge with vestige of casting flash on top of rim. Slight horizontal moulding coinciding with loop top. Upper body of slightly rounded octagonal section. The blade is asymmetrical, with one tip being some 5mm higher than the other. The middle section of the blade is blunted, possibly in antiquity. Both casting seams are evident, and are amplified by the mould halves having been slightly offset. Cf Schmidt & Burgess 1981 ‘Meldreth’ type.



002. Axehead, socketed with loop (upper section only). 104.61g. 50x42x36. Mouth with rounded moulding, two narrow horizontal mouldings below coinciding with the loop top. Two indents are evident in the inner rim at 12 and 3 o’clock, and possibly corresponding characteristics at 6 and 9. Both casting seams evident. The axehead has been broken by repeated blows to the mid-body section on both sides, using an implement that has produced round impact pits of 3-4mm width.



003. Axehead, socketed (upper body fragment). Probably looped. 46.61g. 70x44x9. Mouth with narrow rounded moulding, two narrow horizontal mouldings below. Two moulded opposed crescents below. Horizontal moulded cross rib on internal face 62mm below top. The axehead has been subjected to heavy crushing impacts to the rim resulting in cracking and flattening.



004. Axehead, socketed (upper body fragment). Probably looped. 23.01g. 68x24x13. Mouth with rounded moulding, rounded horizontal moulding below. Narrow casting seam amplified by slight offset of moulds.



005. Uncertain object (fragment). 16.38g. 27x25x17. Square section with hole in one face, probably a casting flaw. Patination consistent with other items in the group, so presumed to be associated.



006. Ingot (fragment). 245g.* 58x38x28. From a plano-convex ingot.



007. Ingot (fragment). 210g.* 52x38x24. Probably from a plano-convex ingot. One surface is heavily pitted, deriving presumably from an aspect of the casting process.



008. Ingot (fragment). 55.01g. 33x22x22. Possibly from a plano-convex ingot.



009. Ingot (fragment). 28.29g. 32x25x11. Rim section of a small plano-convex ingot.



010. Ingot (fragment). 22.74g. 27x25x14. Rim section of a plano-convex ingot.

The blade of the palstave is broadly sub-triangular in plan with relatively straight (but with slightly expanded) sides and a expanding convex cutting edge (fantailed). In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Directly below the stop ridge on both sides is a concave depression which is divided vertically in the centre by a raised rib. The rear part of the axe, from the stop ridge to the butt, is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge, it has a central rectangular shaped septum. The object has a dark green patina. The blade of the axe is quite worn.

It is fairly sharp at one end and blunter at the other; the blunt end may be a worn break. The thickest and widest point is just over a third of the distance from the blunt to the sharp end.

A probable type Lissett metalworking phase (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981,100; plate 48, numbers 616-620).The axe is subrectangular, with a square butt which has been damaged. There is differential wear on the axe blade indicating that the axe has been used. The septem, the area between the flanges, terminates in a faint shield like depression. The casting flashes or seams have been removed and hammered flat. There is an notable casting line on the profile of one side , which could be a flaw or something reproduced from in the mould. These are more common in northern areas of the UK, while palstave axes are more frequent in the South. This axe has a long blade with a slightly divergent sides.



The patina of the axe - its bronzy colour - could be from cleaning, however the attached photograph shows the axe directly after discovery and suggest that the object has been buried in anerobic conditions for at least part of the time it has been buried. This is further evidences by its findspot which indicates a marshy area covered by hillwash.

1066939,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,EARLY MEDIEVAL,-2150,1000,"Short copper alloy awl of uncertain date. Square in cross-section throughout its length it tapers from its greatest thickness at the mid-point, to a moderately sharp point at one end, and to a chisel edge at the other. The object may have had a handle with one end functioning as the tang, but the consistent dark brown patina and hand-worn appearance probably suggest otherwise. Additionally, there is no evidence of hammering at either end; and no stop, and therefore the object was probably intended for light hand-work. Such objects are found in Bronze Age hoards- see WAW-C63EB7, but since they are commonly plain, lack diagnostic features and have simple purposeful forms that are relatively unchanged across many centuries, outside of context their dating is problematic. The landscape in which this object was found is ancient, and within a kilometre radius six Bronze Age artefacts have already been discovered, however, in recorded finds it majors in the Roman, Early Medieval, and Medieval periods. Accordingly, although a Bronze Age date is probable, for reasons given a wider date range is proffered. Circa 2150BC -AD1000.

The cutting edge is V-shaped in profile and moderately convex when viewed from either face. It becomes increasingly more convex towards one end, as it curves around to form the very beginning of one of the side edges, before meeting the break.

The break is ancient and runs broadly parallel to the cutting edge, and then finally obliquely.  No vestige of the side edge survives at the other end but symmetry suggests that it was no more than a few millimetres away. The metal is patinated dark brown on the two faces and reddish-orange on the break. c. 1500 to 800 B.C.

1068938,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"A fragmentary cast copper alloy sword blade fragment, probably of Late Bronze Age date (c.1150-750 BC), possibly of Wilburton or Ewart Park metalworking industry of Needham’s (1991) Periods 4-5, dated 1150-750 BC. The fragment is rectangular in plan and lenticular in section with an overall surviving length of 59.4mm. The fragment has straight transverse breaks on each end and there is a slight bend in the length , suggesting deliberate breakage prior to deposition (‘ritually killed’). The blade has a shallow raised central midrib c.13.5mm wide on both faces (overall object depth of 7.9mm) flanked on each side by a shallow concave section to the blade edge. The blade edge is slightly faceted on both sides (max object width 34.4mm). The fragment weighs 70.56g and has a medium to light green patina with traces of light green and azurite corrosion product.



The fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.



Similar finds are recorded on the PAS database including a very similar sized fragment with the same transverse breaks (SUR-42B7D9). Other similar finds recorded on the PAS include NMGW-FE5523, WMID-871F5F, NMGW-49B5F1, NMGW-35639F

The palstave has a triangular shaped blade in plan. The palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 22.1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;in width and 5.1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;thick.

Beneath the stop-ridge descends a shield shaped hollow, this is more visible on one side than the other. 

The blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical and shows wear. The cutting edge measures 61.2&nbsp;mm&nbsp;in width and is 3.8&nbsp;mm&nbsp;thick.

The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of much of the original surface.

This form and style of palstave fits can be classified as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250&nbsp;BC&nbsp;specifically within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. A close comparison to this palstave has been recorded from the Albrighton Area, Shropshire (HESH-D05FE3) and (WMID-755304) discovered in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

The axe has suffered from corrosion that has recovered the original patina and left a pitted surface. 



The axs fits with some of the earliest metal artefacts found in Britain, possibly associated with the Migdale Metalworking tradition.

The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. The tops of side loops are present on either side.

Middle Bronze Age spearhead, probably of Davis&rsquo; (2012) Group 6; Developed side-looped and dating to the later Arreton-Wilburton phases (c. 1600-1100 BC). 

This is the blade fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken across the socket/blade junction. The spearhead is relatively short in length, with a narrow and flame-shaped blade. The blade has a lozenge-shaped cross-section, with a narrow and prominent mid-rib. The sides of the mid-rib are straight and converging, extending up to the tip of the blade. Original blade edges no longer survive. Fine striations are visible along the original surfaces, parallel to the blade edge. The breaks along the blade edges and socket appear eroded and largely within the patinated surface, indicating damage cause prior to recent discovery, possibly during antiquity. Two glancing scrapes have exposed fresh bronze across the mid-rib, likely caused during recent discovery and retrieval by the finder.

The spearhead has a dull grey-green patina. Original surfaces have a dark grey-green patina, surviving in three small patches on one face. The inner surface of the lower socket has a blue patina, located around the lower break edge. The socket is partially blocked by orange-brown clay soil.","Although incomplete, enough survives of this artefact to suggest that it once belonged to a Group 6: Developed side-looped spearhead. Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (Davis 2012, 109). A side-looped spearhead of Davis&rsquo; Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake which had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, 62) to 1680 &ndash; 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 &ndash; 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (ibid., 7).

The butt end has rounded. The flanges begin about a third of the way along the butt&#39;s length. The cleft between the flanges is relatively smother perhaps from use and there is an irregular hole through the middle near the stop. The casting seem is visible along the sides of the axehead, though some effort to reduce it appears to have taken place. The stop is shallow and worn. The stop has rounded corners with the flanges. The loop is on one side which arcs over the position on the stop. The blade is long, thin and narrow and extends extensively before flaring out at the blade end. there is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade.

The object consists of two pointed drop-shaped elements (both points partially lost), D-shaped in cross-section and joined at their widest point, by a longitudinally recessed oval neck. There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both domed sides of the object. The two moustache tips or prongs flare slightly outwards and terminate with a small rounded knop. The central neck section of the object is plain and undecorated but the underside (between the two prongs) has a sub-rectangular perforation, believed to facilitate the attachment of the object.

There is a central rib running along the blade with a high profile and a lozenge shaped cross section that tapers towards the tip of the spear, which would mean that the fragment is likely from a Middle Bronze Age looped and socketed spearhead, similar to&nbsp;HESH-8E7894. The original blade would likely have been leaf-shaped.

The blade has lost much of its cutting edge due to abrasion in the soil.

&quot;Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV; which she dates to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham&#39;s Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150&nbsp;BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of the Nantcwnlle spear was analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200&nbsp;BC. Davis (2012) classified this form of spearhead as his Group 6 Developed side looped - Type 6 B (flame - flat blade - lozenge plates).&quot;

The chisel is comprised of the blade and a fraction of the tang with a surviving overall length of 65.5mm. The tang is 9.8mm long (terminating in an old break), sub-square in section (5.4mm wide x 4.9mm deep) and flares out to a sub-oval collar (2.9mm tall x 11.5mm wide x 10mm deep) that narrows before the flanged shoulder (with a minimum width of 7.5mm). The sides of the blade are curved slightly before straightening out at the end, reaching a maximum width of 27.4mm. &nbsp;The original blade edge has been lost and has been lost but is roughly straight and asymmetrical, possibly indicating extensive use-wear, and is diagonal in angle with a chunk missing from the corner. Traces of striations are visible on one side. The surface on the opposing side has been lost to old damage. The surviving surface is a medium-dark green patina with patches of lighter green corrosion and black staining, probably from the deposition environment. The chisel weighs 228.79g.

Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Earliest Iron Age. An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the many may be dated to the Ewart Park phase (c.950-700&nbsp;BC) and into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600&nbsp;BC).

Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65).

The object is&nbsp;formed from a pair of globular ovoid elements&nbsp;with sweeping, drop shaped ends which taper upwards and slightly outwards towards pointed tips. The pair of ovoids are&nbsp;connected with&nbsp;a narrowed bar creating a deep recess between them.&nbsp; The upper edges of the bar are&nbsp;arched with a sub rectangular hollow between the projecting tips&nbsp;suggesting the object fitted on to another object. The outer surfaces of the ovoid elements&nbsp;are smooth with three areas of worn and feint decoration visible in the form of 3 or 4 parallel, vertical,&nbsp;short grooves incised in the middle of the ovoids on either side of the arched edge of the bar. The object has a dark grey patina and the weight suggests this is probably a&nbsp;leaded copper-alloy.

1078875,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Description&nbsp;
Early to Middle Bronze Age copper-alloy flanged axehead, of Needham&rsquo;s (2017) Class 5D, Type West Drayton. &nbsp;The body is narrow and expands in width only very slightly with near-straight sides for most of its length, from the semi-circular butt end to more than halfway along the blade. It then expands more dramatically and concavely to form the blade edge and crescentic cutting edge, with tips that recurve slightly. There is a subtle stop-bevel at the centre of the body (between haft and blade) on both faces.&nbsp;

The flanges extend more or less the full length of the body, from near the butt end to the edge-bevel of the blade. Viewed from the side, the blade, flanges and butt end together form a lenticular profile. The flanges are each divided into three longitudinal facets by two subtle arrises on the outsides. The two arrises (and so the central facet) form a narrower lenticular shape. The facets are covered with multiple cast-in shallow oblique grooves. These alternate in direction from facet to facet so that there is a near-ninety-degree angle between the grooves of one facet and its neighbour (a herringbone pattern).

The two flat faces of the blade also bear shallow cast-in grooves. Beginning at the stop-bevel and continuing as far as the edge-bevel of the blade, there are five&nbsp;triplets of transverse grooves extending from flange to flange. Some are approximately straight and others are slightly curved. The fifth&nbsp;triplet (immediately before the edge-bevel) on both faces is barely and only partially visible, except at a very limited angle of illumination. The spaces between each triplet on one face is fairly constant at around four to six millimetres. On the other face there is a larger gap of about eight millimetres between triplets four and five, while triplets two, three and four are closer, at four to five millimetres.&nbsp;All surfaces are patinated a fairly uniform mid greenish-brown. c. 1700 to 1500 B.C.

Penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC), usually being gold plated around copper cores. They are commonly referred to as &#39;hair-rings&#39; and &#39;ring-money&#39; but their function remains uncertain. It is perhaps most likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. The uncertainties around their use are complicated by the fact that very few are recorded from secure archaeological contexts.

While the general form of this ring is consistent with such Bronze Age objects, the lack of a gold covering makes it difficult to be certain.

The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The axehead is broken, with the butt end missing. The break is an irregular concave in shape; the width at the break is 37.99&nbsp;mm&nbsp;(thickness:7.23 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the break to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (11.33&nbsp;mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 45.59 mm&nbsp;(thickness 7.98mm).

It measures 62.07mm&nbsp;in length, &nbsp;and it has a maximum thickness of 11.32&nbsp;mm. It weighs 145.65 grams.

The axe is a mid to dark brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. One side has a patch of light green corrosion where the surface patina is damaged, possibly from abrasion caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the original surface detail.

The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).

These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.&nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

Description:&nbsp;The fragmentary cast axe is represented by a blade fragment only and is of comparatively slender form. At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket of sub-rectangular form (22.01mm x 7mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 4mm), probably broken in antiquity.&nbsp; The cutting edge is gently curving with rounded corners.

Dimensions:&nbsp;length 34.94mm, width 35.80mm, thick 12.26mm, weight 56.22g

Discussion: The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c.1100 &ndash; 800BC. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,56.22,,12.25,12.26,34.94,1,,Steven Nye,South East,Kent,Canterbury,Barham,TR1946,,51.17128886,1.13141792,KENT-483F66,,KENT483F66.jpg,Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/lrogerson/KENT483F66.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1196939.jpg
1079698,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1250,-100,"A cast copper alloy &#39;moustache&#39; shaped object of uncertain use. The object is three-dimensional and consists of a single drooping ovoid element with pointed tips. These ovoid is decorated with multiple grooves running down the body but stopping before the tip. The base of the ovoid is flat and reveals a hollow interior; at this point at the rim is a circular hole that passes through both sides passing through both sides. 

A number of these have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database, including WMID-CA9D04, BH-037A57 and SF-520513. There is some variation in these objects. &nbsp;One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117), and as such, they are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example. Many form the terminal of a bar shaped object that has a hole passing through the centre, these are solid one piece castings and have led to the theory that they could be dagger fittings. However this example was riveted in place via a pin that passes horizontally through the mount, this type of attachment may have proven to be too delicate for a dagger. The absence of clear archaeological evidence makes the true use of these objects conjectural, but it entirely likely that this style of object may have had a number of uses.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2022-05-26T00:00:00Z,2022-07-04T00:00:00Z,,,3.36,,,9,19,1,,Kurt Adams,South West,Gloucestershire,Tewkesbury,Dumbleton,SP0336,,52.02241099,-1.95769116,GLO-49A053,,GLO49A053.jpg,,Bristol City Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO49A053.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1197221.jpg

They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). &#39;Awl&#39; is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments.

The head of the pin is globular with a hollow terminal that could have held a stone. The edge of the hollow appears to possibly have been crimped so as to enable it to be compressed and thus hold the stone in place. The head has a diameter of 8.49mm, whilst the diameter of the shaft immediately beneath it is 5.15mm. This increases to 5.67mm over a distance of 10.63mm, after which there is a central swelling decorated with alternating grooves and ridges (11 grooves, 10 ridges) that run circumferentially around the swelling, with a maximum diameter of 7.14mm in the centre of the swelling. This then tapers to 4.99mm before the break. There is the remnant of a loop that would have protruded from the shaft. The object has a Verdigris patina.

&quot;Sally Worrell (PAS adviser) says that these pins &quot;Represent a valuable addition to the small dataset found in Britain and elsewhere in the north European Plain. These pins are mostly, but not always decorated and may be perforated or looped or neither and share common features such as the shape of the head, the swelling of the neck and decoration in the form of incised linear motifs. They occur within the &#39;Ornament horizon&#39; phase of the late Taunton or early Penard phase of the later mid Bronze Age, approximately 1400-1250 BC&quot;.&quot;

1084385,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-800,"A cast copper alloy casting jet or &quot;gate&quot; with one stump&nbsp;of a sprue, possibly&nbsp;Late Bronze Age in date. The jet is made of a domed body that is D-shaped in cross section with an oval base. The single sprue is oval in cross section extending 7.5 mm before ending in a rounded break. The jet is a dark, sometimes medium, green colour.

The jet is 24.8mm in diameter on its body and 18.8mm thick.The fragment weighs 24.88 grams.

Casting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below. As they represent re-usable metal, they were often retained and regularly turn up in base metal hoards of the period. Casting waste is difficult to date, but fragments with similar shapes exist on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database (NMGW-57CD88, GLO-24BAE1, and IOW-904B38) ​​​​​​which are considered to be Late Bronze Age in date.&nbsp;Furthermore, Pearce (1983, 571, pl.10, no.82e) illustrates a similar casting jet with conical sprues from Lelant in Cornwall, which was found associated with swords fragments that are from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850&nbsp;BC) while Knight, Ormrod &amp; Pearce (2015, 82, pl.9, no.247f) illustrate a casting jet from Gussage All Saints in Dorset on which was found with a socketed axe mouth fragment.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-10-18T00:00:00Z,2022-10-18T00:00:00Z,,,24.88,18.8,24.8,,,1,,Edward Caswell,South East,Oxfordshire,South Oxfordshire,West Hagbourne,SU5287,,51.57947126,-1.25096423,OXON-7C88B5,,OXON7C88B5.jpg,Bronze Age Casting jet,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON7C88B5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1200750.jpg

1084641,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-950,"An almost complete Late Middle Bronze Age looped palstave axehead &nbsp;of the late Penard / early Wilburton&nbsp;tradition dating c. 1150-950 cal&nbsp;BC.

The axehead is almost complete with an incomplete cutting edge. The butt end terminates in a straight edge measuring: 21.71mm wide and 5.93mm thick. The&nbsp;septum is rectangular&nbsp;and measures 66.93mm long from the stop to the butt.&nbsp;The flanges extend in a straight line rising from approximately 30mm from the butt&nbsp;and&nbsp;extending to meet the projecting stop-ridge. Adjacent to the stop is a single low attachment loop, with a D-shaped aperture, the loop measuring&nbsp;26.0&nbsp;mm&nbsp;long; 9.28mm wide and 6.75mm thick. There are no casting seams.

The blade is flat slender and&nbsp;and curves up steeply at the stop to meet the projecting&nbsp;stop-ridge; below which extend three worn parallel ribs on both sides of the blade measuring approximately 17mm in length. The flange sides of the axehead above the stop are straight and taper to the narrower butt. Below the stop ridge the sides of the blade narrow&nbsp;slightly in width&nbsp;and become slightly concave, flaring out gently&nbsp;to the cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged along its length with the original profile lost.&nbsp;

Measurements: length: 150.46mm; width at stop-ridge excluding loop: 25.17mm; width at stop-ridge including loop: 36.98mm; thickness at stop-ridge: 31.91mm and weight: 353g.

This palstave was discovered in the vicinity of&nbsp;a Middle Bronze Age hoard&nbsp;SUSS-A2AE5D (2022T305); a couple of weeks after the excavation of the hoard. The notable difference in condition of this example and the later date suggest this was not&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;hoard.&nbsp;",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,353,,,31.91,150.46,1,,Jane Clark,South East,West Sussex,Horsham,Ashurst,TQ1716,,50.9315933,-0.33643094,SUSS-92DF44,,SUSS92DF44.jpg,A late copper alloy looped palstave axehead,Sussex Archaeological Society,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/janeclark68s/SUSS92DF44.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1201021.jpg

1086165,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"A complete copper-alloy short flanged Caverton type axehead of early to middle Bronze Age date, c.AD 1600 - 1400&nbsp;BC. Caverton type. 

The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a rounded butt end, and concave and wasted sides which flare to a crescentic blade.

Two integral lateral lozenge shaped flanges are present along either side, rising steadily from the butt, rounding off at the apex midway along the body, before sloping steadily back down to the mid-point of the sides. The exterior surfaces of the flanges have been filed smooth leaving no visible casting lines.

A slight steepening to the profile of the axe is present slightly above where the flanges meet the body representing a very slight stop-ridge. D-shaped panels are present below the stop ridge.

The metal has a dark brown patina with some delamintation. The axehead is 154.9mm long, 74.9mm wide at the blade, 27.2mm wide at the butt end, 33.1mm thick at the widest point of the flanges, and weighs 530g.

Schmidt and Burgess illustrate similar examples on plate 36 (e.g. No.443) which are dated to the EBA-MBA transition, c.1600-1400 cal BC (1981: 85-86).
