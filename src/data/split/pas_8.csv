544511,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is D shaped with one edge displaying a distinctive curved (domed edge) whilst the opposite is relatively flat. It is likely that this is caused by the axe being cast in an open stone mould. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.94 mm (thickness: 2.25 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there may be evidence of a proto stop ridge (median bevel) as the butt does exhibit flattening of both surfaces. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (10.11 mm). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 27.87 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.



It measures 65.79 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 27.87 mm, width at the butt is 12.94 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 10.11 mm. It weighs 56.5 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). It is closest in style to the Biggar variants of the Migdale type axes (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 46-47), although it is smaller than other recorded examples. This variant tends to have a relatively narrow butt and widened blade, straight or concave sides which diverge towards the cutting edge. Variant Biggar show a relatively narrow butt, which in many cases is characteristically flattened, less rounded than in Migdale axes. The butt therefore has a more squarish appearance. Below the butt the sides do not diverge immediately, but run parallel for at least one third of their overall length. Cutting edge is often flatter, less rounded than is the case with Type Migdale proper. It is never recurved, and very rarely strongly tipped.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

544699,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,POST MEDIEVAL,-2150,1500,"A complete cast copper alloy probable Awl, possibly of Bronze Age dating but could easily be later in dating (2150 BC to c. AD 1500).


The awl consists of a sub square sectioned artefact that gradually tapers from a wide centre, to a sharp point at both ends. No obvious tang is present. Faint grooves are present down each of the thicker sides.


It measures 51.35 mm in length, has a maximum width of 3.49 mm and has a maximum thickness of 3.24 mm. It weighs 2.4 g.


The probable awl is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.


Similar artefacts have been recorded on the PAS database as NMS-ACEA64, NMS-0F5EF3, SF-6FC795, LVPL-7E3686, GLO-9FB903, HESH-399E94 and PUBLIC-5155C5. However as awls are a functional artefact, the form changes very little from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval period. Similar awls were found during the excavations at York (Ottaway & Rogers, 2002, pages 2729-2730, fig 1338), in particular SF 11522, which exhibits a similar groove on one side like this example and has been dated to the late 11th Century AD. Therefore this example could be of any date from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval Period (2150 BC to 1500 AD).

Only the tip of the the spearhead survives; it has a rounded mid rib with narrow wings. The tip is slightly bent, probably through use, and the wings are chipped, perhaps due to thinning of the metal from corrosion which may have led to some losses from the outer edge of each wing. The surface has a stable, slightly pitted, patinated surface of green-brown colour. The surviving length is 45 mm, with a maximum width of 12mm and weight of 10.34g.

Richard Davis comments that he has not seen a fragment like this before. He notes:





1. It is not clear what type of spearhead this is - whether it had loops or pegholes in the socket, and whether it is from the Middle or Late Bronze Age.


2. Cuts in the blade edges are normally the result of combat damage or an intentional ""killing"" of the spearhead prior to votive deposition. Excellent examples of this ""killing"" is found in some of the spearheads from the Blackmoor Hoard, also from Hampshire. However, intentional cuts in blade edges are normally found in spearheads that are deposited when complete or with a large part remaining, not just as a fragment as in this case.


3. The multiple cuts on one blade edge look decorative - the upper four cuts are at regular intervals. The reworking may have been to form a tool, but this seems unlikely as the jagged edges are not sharp. The apparent barb on the other blade edge does not seem to have a particular function.


In summary,the probability is that it is a fragment of an LBA pegged spearhead, because the incidence of intentional fragments was far greater in this period. This is an interesting and unique piece, but one whose condition and damage is difficult to interpret.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,16.97,,,8.75,49.6,1,Richard Davis,Margaret Broomfield,South East,Hampshire,Winchester,Chilcomb,SU5028,GPS (from the finder),51.04918,-1.288079,SUR-0FB443,,12-1344a.JPG,Bronze age: Spear,Surrey County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/margaretb/12-1344a.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/421783.jpg

550383,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1300,"A cast copper alloy (bronze) early palstave / primary Group I - shield patterned palstave of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1300 BC) - most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.



The palstave is broadly rectangular in plan with relatively straight parallel side which flare on the lower blade and expand to form a wide crescentic cutting edge / blade. In profile the palstave is lentoid with the widest section being before and after the stop ridge - where it tapers to form the butt and blade. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 100.4mm long and the width of cutting edge is 69.0mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 2.4mm and the cutting edge is well preserved and still sharp. The maximum thickness of the blade is 17.2mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 32.7mm). The upper blade is well preserved. A poorly defined sub-triangular shaped dish is present on both faces - although it is more defined on one edge. This depression is interpreted as a form of shield pattern, although the exterior edges are not decorated / defined with raised ribs. This form of palstave is not commonly looped. However on the edges of the upper blade - slightly below the stop ridge Two raised transverse ribs / swellings are present. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and irregular in profile; the sides in profile are parallel. In section the butt has an H shaped cross section - although the raised side flanges. The rear section of the palstave measures 76.4mm length and has a maximum thickness 38.0mm. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 73.4mm long, and 17.8mm wide and 6.7mm thick. The butt of the axe is complete - it has a slight U shaped notch at the centre of the butt but this is patinated suggesting damage in antiquity. The width at the butt is 27.4mm. The flange facets are broadly sub-triangular (an irregular arc) in shape they are at their highest point prior to the junction with the stop ridge and project onto the upper blade. The stop ridge is set very low and is fused to flanges  - this forms two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. The side flange extends to a maximum height of 15.3mm above the septum and the stop ridge is 6.0mm high. The profile of the flanges on one face is slightly irregular with V shaped notches being removed - this is original to the manufacture an dis possibly a casting flaw - all the edges of these notches are patinated. The junction between the septum and stop ridge is crescentic in shape and the base of the septum is slightly hollow - has a U shaped depression. The long edges of the axe have been finished and the remnants of the casting seam have been removed by trimming, filing and hammering. The palstave measures 176.8mm long and weighs 569 grams. The relative heaviness of the axe could suggest a larger than normal degree of lead being added to the alloy.



The palstave is a mid brown colour with a thick well formed patina which covers almost all surfaces of the axe. In a number of places the patina has been removed by active corrosion - where this has occurred a roughened light green coloured metal is present. The patina has been removed on one flange and a bright metallic brass colour has been revealed - this damage is likely to be due to the axe being clipped during its removal from the soil. The axe is remarkably unabraded and the tips of the axe blade are unusually well preserved - this suggests that the axe has never been within upper / active ploughzone.



Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in: Savory, 1980; Catalogue of the Bronze Age collections in the National Museum of Wales; Figs 19-20 cat no 132 Llanfair-mathafarn-eithaf, Anglesey / Yns Mon and 139-142 Chepstow, Glos, Llanddaniel-fab (Anglesey) and Caernarvonshire respectively.

The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan and in section.

The axehead is rounded at one end, the cutting edge, and the axe then tapers towards the butt. The axe is quite thin and does not vary much in thickness although the middle is slightly thicker than the outer edges. There is no evidence for decoration on the surface of the object but that could be due to the fact that the surface has corroded away completely. The object is purpley-brown in colour with areas of a light green corrosion.


It is likely that this dates to the Early Bronze Age and metalworking stage I to II which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2, circa 2500 to 2050 CAL. BC.

Discussion



The tanged chisel (1) has other parallels in the database such as a tanged chisel from South Oxfordshire (Byard 2012) (BERK-52E8C3) and one other from Winfrith Newburgh, Dorset (Hayward Trevarthen 2012) (DOR-F18347). Tanged chisels have been found in several Bronze Age hoards and have a wide distribution in Britain and Ireland.



Burgess and Gerloff (1981, 36ff) include a blade of similar shape and size to the tanged dagger or knife from Bolton-Le-Sands (2) in their Group II ('Damaged Blades Modified for Rehafting'). It is similar to an example from Marston Trussel, Northamptonshire (Ibid, no.248), described as: ""[A t]anged blade, either a knife made in this form or possibly a dirk with butt cut down for rehafting, in which case the torn rivet hole would have been secondary."" (Ibid., pl. 32, no 248). It is also similar to two others on the Portable Antiquity Scheme database. One a cast tanged knife found in Dorset (DOR-FAC625) and the other an incomplete knife found in Wiltshire (WILT-83A428).



Both finds (1-2) can be dated on typological ground to the Late Bronze Age Wilburton and Ewart Park phases, c.1000-850 BC. Metalworking waste (3-4) is a common feature of Late Bronze Age hoards and finds.



The four objects (1-4) appear to have been associated and represent a single find.



Conclusion



In terms of their age and grouping of more than two items, this find qualifies as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage and so as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure (Designation) Order 2002.

The end of the butt is rounded, presumably by wear. The surface where this object was detached from the rest of the axe is rough and shows the pale green signs of recent corrosion. This probably represents a recent break. Suggested date: Middle Bronze Age, 1300-1150 BC.

552605,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-800,"A copper alloy object; probably an awl and probably of Bronze Age date (2150 BC - 800 BC). One end of the object terminates in a sharp point and has a circular cross section. The object widens at its centre and becomes increasingly sub-rectangular in section. The object has been flattened towards the tang end and becomes sub-rectangular in section. This end of the object is flat, however it is slightly rough which suggests it has been broken and the object is incomplete. The object appears to have been cleaned so has lost much of its patina.

A date of Bronze Age has been given for this object due to similar examples on the database. However the record for a similar object - WMID-BA89E6 - states that, as awls are functional artefacts, their form changes very little from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval period. Similar awls were found during the excavations at York (Ottaway & Rogers, 2002, pages 2729-2730, fig 1338). Therefore such example could be of any date from the Bronze Age through to the Medieval Period (2150 BC to AD 1500).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2011-11-22T00:00:00Z,2012-11-21T00:00:00Z,,,4.6,,,5.1,56.1,1,Lucy Creighton,Lucy Creighton,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Selby,Towton,SE4839,From finder,53.845032,-1.271935,SWYOR-320717,,PAS_2057_awl1.jpg,Bronze Age Awl,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/lucyc/PAS_2057_awl1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/421444.jpg

Discussion



These ingot fragments probably belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, dating to c.1000-800 BC. Four of the fragments are plano-convex, being rounded on one side and flat on the other. Ingots such as these were cast in a dish-shaped mould, and are often referred to as 'bun' ingots due to their shape. Ingots of raw metal were transported and traded throughout Britain and Europe during the Late Bronze Age. They were frequently broken up into fragments, ready to be smelted to make a range of bronze weaponry, tools and ornaments. Ingots (and ingot fragments) are a regular feature of LBA hoard deposits in southern England (cf. Turner 2010, 86-7). Numerous plano-convex ingot fragments have been recovered in Devon and the surrounding regions (e.g. Powell 2005a; 2005b), most notably the copper and tin ingots recovered from a probable shipwreck site off the coast of Salcombe (Roberts & Veysey 2011; Needham et al. forthcoming). Scientific analysis is currently being undertaken on the Salcombe finds at the British Museum (B. Roberts pers comm.). The East Devon finds are therefore significant for their potential (subject to future analysis) to reveal information regarding patterns of trade and exchange in the Late Bronze Age period in the South-West of Britain.","As these seven Late Bronze Age ingots were found in the same field within c. 20m of each other, they are most likely to originate from a single deposit, which has been dispersed. This material is eligible as Treasure under the Treasure Order (2002), as it is a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects.",3,Copper alloy,,Donated to museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-03-04T00:00:00Z,,2013T196,,,,,,,7,Danielle Wootton,Danielle Wootton,South West,Devon,East Devon,Otterton,SY0884,Centred on field,50.64839446,-3.30264451,DEV-ED41D1,,2013T196.jpg,Bronze Age Hoard,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/beckyd/2013T196.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/478557.jpg

The axe is complete and is of diminutive size (with an overall length of 79.9mm and a weight of 56.8g). The butt (with a width of 13mm) is straight but angled. Both sides are convex, reaching its maximum width (of 17.1mm) immediately behind the proto stop ridge, before expanding sharply to produce an expanded blade edge. The side facets have been hammered and are also convex across their depths, with a maximum depth at the stop (of 10.9mm and a maximum height of 1.5mm). The angled side facets are decorated linear diagonals, in opposing directions on the opposite facets. There is no evidence for decoration at the central band of the sides. The flanges appear to end immediately before the butt. The septum is straight and gradually thickens to the stop (where the axe has a thickness of 8.9mm and a consistent septum width of 8mm). In front of the stop, the blade is decorated with four incised lines, before an intricate incised motif on the blade, comprising two columns (on each blade) of inverted V's, not quite meeting at the centre. The flanges on the blade give the appearance of converging at their terminals, defining a rounded end. Beneath is the blade facet, which is not decorated and gradually narrows to the blade edge. The blade (with a width 25.6mm) is slightly recurved. The surface has a dark-brown patina with some pitting and surface loss.","The axe has a number of unusual features and does not easily fit into the Developed axe sequence as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981) . The axe is considerably smaller than most developed axes and although similar sized examples are recorded as Type Bandon, Variant Swinton, these are rarely decorated and tend to have a squatter form than the slender form of this example.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-02-11T00:00:00Z,,,,56.8,,,10.9,79.9,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9878,GPS (from the finder),51.491714,-3.470589,NMGW-6A0686,,2012.60.1.jpeg,NMGW-6A0686: Early Bronze Age developed axe,All rights reserved,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2012.60.1.jpeg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/423192.jpg

555618,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1250,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) dagger fragment of Middle Bronze Age dating (1400 BC to 1250 BC).


Less than 25% of the dagger is present. The rest is presumed, lost in antiquity. The dagger fragment is sub rectangular in plan. The dagger has a sub lentoid cross section. The remains of one rivet hole is present at the top, the other is missing. The blade tapers towards the edges. None of the edges are original, all have been damaged. Neither side of the blade exhibits decoration.


The blade measures 64.32 mm in length, 35.70 mm wide and 2.95 mm thick. It weighs 28.9 g.


The blade is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface patina, leaving areas of a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion from occurring. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box, such as a tupperware box, with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue paper and silica gel.","Comment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): I think this is the hilt and upper blade of a trapizodal hilted rapier of middle BA date. The remains of one rivet hole can be seen on the upper edge of the hilt - and the upper part is  a clear trapezoid tapering in width and expanding in section at the junction with the upper blade - which seems slightly stepped - although abrasion hasn't been kind - the blade looks lentoid in section and the upper plate has a flatter section.


From the profile I think it looks most like a Grp III rapier or more likely  a dirk (shorter rapier - under 30cm / 1ft in length)- see http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/109896 and http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/rapiers-and-dirks

Less than 25% of the socketed axehead is present, consisting of the base of the socket and the blade edge. The fragment is sub rectangular in plan, and triangular in section. The socket is rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along both of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at the sides. Possible filemarks are present on the front and back of the axehead.


The socketed axehead fragment measures 33.83 mm in length, 52.77 mm wide (at the blade), 41.23 mm wide (at the body), 19.62 mm thick (at the body), 3.46 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 15.13 mm deep. It weighs 67.3 g.


The socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.


Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) comments that it is late BA rather than Middle - as in post Wilburton - Llyn Fawr phase (1150-750 BC).  Almost all socketed axes are from the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC). It looks as if it comes from a narrow bladed axe - something like a Yorkshire or Meldrith type - but there is just not enough to say one way or the other (definitely not a Swales Axe).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-11-01T00:00:00Z,2006-11-30T00:00:00Z,,,67.3,,,19.62,33.83,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Hyde Lea,SJ9120,From finder,52.77750833,-2.13485881,WMID-EB5248,,WMID-EB5248.jpg,Middle to Late Bronze Age: Socketed Axehead fragment,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-EB5248.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/423792.jpg

557432,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy looped palstave with central rib and raised flange facets dating from the Middle Bronze Age (1500 BC - 1150 BC).


The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and an incomplete convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 88.35 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 40.27 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 2.93 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 16.68 mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 24.46 mm).


Beneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a tapering central rib. This rib extends approximately half way down the length of the blade. The rib itself, although present on both sides, is crisper and less eroded on one of the two faces.


The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 62.63 mm long, 17.55 mm wide, and 8.13 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving one corner rounded. The butt is 19.25 mm wide and 3.09 mm thick. The loop is 26.42 mm long, by 8.83 mm wide and projects 9 mm.


The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. On one side the flange facets are convex and curve over to almost form an open socket. Whereas the other side has less pronounced or developed facets.


In total the palstave measures 149.45 mm in length, 40.33 mm wide (maximum) and 25.72 mm thick. It weighs 262.3 g.


Several casting flaws in the form of air bubbles are present on the septum. The poor quality of the casting is confirmed by an xray of the palstave which demostrated several large air bubbles within the internal structure of the palstave.


The palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.


Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in Savory, 1980; catalogue entries 171, 172, 175, and 263 (the Mynydd Ta-y-glannau, Cemmaes Hoard). All of these examples fit into the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II).

The casting flash is visible on the loop, which appears worn, but otherwise all casting flashes have been smoothed down. The loop measures 15.57mm long (internal 5.92mm) and 3.89mm thick.


Below the stop ridge the blade is waisted, min. 19.08mm wide (x 9.40mm thick). It then flares to the cutting edge (21.58mm), which is curved and the corners a little damaged. It is 1.95mm thick at the edge.

558553,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy blade, of Middle Bronze Age dating (1500 CAL BC to 1150 CAL BC - Needham's Period 5).


The blade fragment is sub trapezoidal in plan, and lentoid in cross section. The blade tapers towards either edge. The edges to the top and bottom are old, pre depostional breaks. No evidence of rivet holes are present at the top of the blade fragment. No decoration is present on either the front or back of the blade.


It measures 62.34 mm in length, has a maximum width of 22.69 mm and a minimum of 14.43 mm. It is 2.82 mm thick in the centre of the blade and 1.06 mm thick along the blade edges. It weighs 11.6 g.


The blade fragment is a mid to dark brown colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has been removed in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green colour. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze diseases) occurring. This would be a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the blade should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with acid free tissue and silica gel.","Comment from Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO): As for the blade fragment - from the  size I think you are looking at either a large dagger or probably more likely a rapier fragment. The hilt would have been trapezoidal - and it has lost its rivets and upper part - it has also lost the shoulders but you can then see the blade thickening away from the hilt to for the mid rib. I expect the other end continued for maybe 1/3 again as the rib is parallel even if the sides aren't due to plough roll. 


Similar rapiers have been dated to the later Middle Bronze Age (MBA III - specifically the Penard phase / industry) - Rowlands 1976 p68-70) which corresponds with Needham's Period 5 (1500-1150 CAL BC).",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-02-03T00:00:00Z,,,,11.6,,,2.82,62.34,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,East Staffordshire,Uttoxeter,SK0734,From finder,52.903393,-1.897374,WMID-277BF6,,WMID-277BF6.jpg,Middle Bronze Age: Dagger / Blade fragment,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-277BF6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/425465.jpg
558981,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"The find consists of a fragment of a socketed instrument, a socketed tool, five fragments of a hollow ring with semi-circular cross section and a length of copper alloy wire.



The find can be considered as an addendum to 2010 T442 based on the location of the find and the typological similarities between artefacts from both cases/finds. Furthermore, the fragment of socketed tool and hollow ring may belong to (and refit with) objects from 2010 T442. This impression was gained from examining the available photos of the earlier case (since acquired by the Society of Antiquaries, Newcastle, after being declared Treasure). The objects in this new find are very similar in form and condition. They appear, therefore, to derive from a dispersed hoard.

Copper alloy socketed punch or awl. Small area of damage to mouth of socket, otherwise in good state of preservation. Two perforations at opposite sides of the socket mouth. The socket has two ribs and extends to a stem with four sides that comes to a broken point with a 'blob' of corrosion metal. The object appears to have been a socketed punch or awl.




Length: 70mm; Diameter of socket: 17.5mm; Weight: 26.4g





The copper alloy socketed instruments (Nos. 2, 4) are typical of the Late Bronze Age, as are the fragments of the copper alloy fitting (No. 3), and is a type found in other hoards of this period (e.g. The Great Freeman Street Hoard, Nottinghamshire: Smith 1957, GB. 22, 2(2), No. 16; The Grosvenor Crescent hoard: Colquhoun & Burgess 1988, pl. 174, 9; Wilburton hoard: Ibid., pl. 152, 5; Fincham, West Norfolk: NHER Number: 36176; and the Monmore hoard, Killin, Stirling: Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 185, no. 1045). A similar ring was recently reported as a single find through the Portable Antiquities Scheme (NMS-688046) from Burnham Market and Burnham Overy, Norfolk.



The similarities it shares with an object discovered in the 2010 T442 (No. 8) find suggest that it may belong to the same type of object, possibly the same object. If the fragments of No. 3 do indeed match this earlier object, then the identification of this as probable phalara in the report for 2010 T442 can now be called into question and revised (cf. O'Connor 1975).



The socketed awl or punch (No. 4) is relatively difficult to parallel, although the socketed technology and associations are well known Late Bronze Age features. A similar tool is recorded as a single find from Lea Marshes, Walthamstow (British Museum: WG 1762). Another example is from a Late Bronze Age hoard found near the Pigeon's Cave, on the North side of Great Orme's Head, Caernarvonshire, Wales (Savory 1980, no. 307, 4). Savory raises the possibility that it may have functioned as an awl for metalworking or a spiked ferrule for mounting on the end of a spear (Ibid., 127). The former seems more likely.","On the balance of probabilities, based on typological comparanda and spatial proximity, the objects that comprise this find are part of a dispersed Late Bronze Age hoard that also included finds from an earlier case (2010 T442), and are therefore treated as an addendum to that case.

559829,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1150,410,"
A complete cast copper alloy awl, possibly dating to the later Bronze Age but more possibly as late as the early Roman period. The awl has a sub-rectangular cross section at one end that may have originally terminated in a flattened wedge-shape, as other examples recorded on this database do. This terminal widens to become more rounded in the centre of the awl with the opposing end tapering to a point. There is some pitting on the surface of the awl which suggests some age, however there is some debate as to the date of such awls, which probably first appeared in the Late Bronze Age but could conceivably have continued to have been made until much later; here the patina does suggests a later prehistoric date.

In plan the axe is a sub elongated triangle. The butt is rounded, and in profile slightly tapers to a rounded edge. The sides are straight with no flaring outwards of the blade tip. The blade cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical suggesting the axe was functional rather than votive. In profile, lengthways, the axehead curves slightly. The surface of the axehead has an abraded surface with patches of blue corrosion and a large area of encrustation. The patina is a mottled mid grey/green colour.

2. Copper alloy Sussex Loop bracelet or armlet. Fragmentary. Lozengical cross-section. The loop was made from a single, twisted bar with flattened terminals. The loop is broken into six fragments (No. i-vi, below), and, unlike loop No. 1, is no longer held together as one piece. The metal is heavily corroded across most surfaces but is better preserved along short lengths of the bar than loop No. 1. Where the original edges of the bar are preserved, it is possible to identify rows of decorative 'nicks' applied to the corners of the lozenge shaped metal rod (i.e. on two of four edges).

9. Copper alloy palstave ['5'] (Rowlands's Class 2, Group 2, side flanged). Medial rib running from stop ridge to the centre of the blade but not possible to detect whether a rib also ran from stop ridge to butt end. Smooth cutting blade showing evidence of use-wear. Both sides of the blade show overlapping/miscast seams.

10. Copper alloy palstave ['2'] (Rowlands's Class 2, Group 2, side flanged). Medial rib from stop ridge to blade edge but not possible to detect a medial rib between stop ridge and butt, probably partly due to heavy erosion in this area of the blade. Cutting blade is distorted and this may be an original feature.

Non-associated finds



One additional find was made alongside this hoard:



12. Modern rectangular section of, incomplete, copper alloy tubing with join/seam.



Dimensions: Weight 6g; Length (incomplete): 37mm; Width: 16mm; Thickness: 4.5mm



This item appears not to have been associated with the Middle Bronze Age finds and therefore does not qualify as potential treasure.","Discussion 



At the broadest level, the objects in the Ockham hoard can be dated typo-chronologically to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC). More particularly, the early palstaves (Nos. 5-10), probably date to the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1250 BC) (cf. Rowlands 1976, 31-2), and possibly to the Acton Park metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) (cf. O'Connor 1980, 53). The two Sussex Loop bracelets (Nos. 1-2) and two spiral coiled finger rings (Nos. 3-4) belong to the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' of the Taunton and Penard phases (c.1400-1150 BC) (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).



As their name suggests, Sussex Loop armlets (or bracelets) are found in the county of Sussex, generally within 16 miles of Brighton (White 1991). The Ockham find is notable for having been found in Surrey and is the first certain find from outwith Sussex, to the author's knowledge. Spiral coiled finger rings are known from Southern England: Roberts (2007, appendix) lists ten examples, with recent additions from the 'Near Lewes' (2011 T192) hoard and the 'Near Wylye' hoard (2012 T786). Palstaves of Class 2 Group 2 are found throughout Southern England, with a strong concentration in the upper Thames (Rowlands 1976, map 4; O'Connor 1980, 52-3; see Discussion in Capper et al. for 2011 T192). Palstaves of Class 3 are rarer than Class 2 examples but have also been found throughout most of southern England, with concentrations in Kent and Hampshire (Rowlands 1976, map 5).



A notable feature of these finds is that eight of the twelve hoards include objects also found with the Ockham hoard: either arm-rings (or bracelets), Sussex Loops or palstaves. The most notable of these overlapping composition hoards are the Hollingbury Hoard, Sussex, which included a palstave, two Sussex Loops and a spiral twisted torc (Roberts 2007, appendix, no. 85; Rowlands 1976, 267), and Stump Bottom, Cissbury, also in Sussex, which comprised two Sussex Loops, three spiral coiled finger rings and several additional ornaments (Roberts 2007, appendix, no. 95; Rowlands 1976, 269). The Ockham hoard therefore shares its composition, as well as a unique armlet/bracelet type, in common with ornament horizon hoards from Sussex.



Conclusion



This case comprises of a find of more than two objects of base metal of prehistoric date (Nos. 1-10, above) and therefore qualifies as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), Designation Order (2002). The associated ceramic finds probably from one vessel (No. 11, above) also qualify as Treasure by association with the metalwork as it was probably deposited at the same time as part of a 'hoard' deposit.

561581,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1150,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy ingot, probably originally circular in plan and plano-convex in profile, but this fragment is rectangular in plan, square in profile and triangular in section, as it likely comes from the centre of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face and base of the ingot are smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and the sides of the fragment have ridges and cavities typically seen in the sections of these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), the neighbouring parish, which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

562892,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy late flanged axe (c. 1700-1500 BC). The blade of the axe is slightly flared to the blade tips, and the blade cutting edge is a deep symmetrical convex shape. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the flange facets. Body and haft end of the axe has almost straight sides which taper slightly at the butt, which is straight at the terminal. One face is possibly decorated at the junction of the body and blade, just within the facets, in the form on at least three short linear notches. However, there is a possibility this is damage from antiquity. The body of the axe has shallow (2.92mm deep) rounded flange facets, therefore in profile the facet sides are a pointed oval and taper down at the butt. The flange top/crests are in-turned therefore the width between the crests is narrower than the base. The surface has large patches of a green/brown coloured patina with areas of the surface missing, but not recently, and one patch of active corrosion. It is in a fair condition. The axe measures 147.36mm long, 53.71mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 24.06mm thick across the apex of the facets. It weighs 471.4g.



Ben Roberts (University of Durham) comments that the axe is a 'late flanged axe rather than a palstave which would date it to the latter part of the Early Bronze Age (c. 1700- 1500 BC)'. (pers comm). This type of axes are distributed across Britain, and few have been found in a datable context, therefore making it difficult to date them with accuracy (late flanged axe rather than a palstave which would date it to the latter part of the Early Bronze Age (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2013-04-08T23:00:00Z,,,471.4,,,24.06,147.36,1,Ben Roberts,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Malvern Hills,Rushwick,SO8155,From finder,52.1929072,-2.27937017,WAW-BA7221,,WAW-BA7221.jpg,"Bronze Age flat axe transitional palstave (plan, profile, plan and profile).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-BA7221.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/428439.jpg
562997,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy (bronze) axe most probably from a palstave of Middle Bronze Age date, circa 1500-1150 BC.   The blade is broken below the stop ridge and there is no evidence to suggest whether this fragment is from a looped - or unlooped palstave variant. The break is worn and patinated suggesting that it has been damaged in antiquity; only the lower blade of the axehead survives.  A casting error is present on one flange. The edge of one of the flanges has been flattened with the re-set copper alloy forming a lip.  The fragment has an irregular form in plan with the sides gently widening away from the slightly concave broken edge and terminating in asymmetrical flares due to the manufacturing error.  The cutting edge is lost but retains its convex form.  The fragment is sub-triangular in section.  The section at the break is sub-rectangular.  The surface of the fragment is heavily abraded with pitting and patches of light green patina.   There is no evidence of rib decoration.  Overall, the fragment has a mid green / brown colour.

Discussion: The combination of (socketed) tools, awls and ingot fragments suggests that this represents a Late Bronze Age (c.1000 - 700 BC) hoard.

564356,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,,,-1600,-1500,"An Early Bronze Age copper alloy flat axe head. In section, the axe head is lenticular in shape. In plan, the axe head is roughly triangular in shape; the butt end is narrow and has a rounded end, and the sides flare out towards the cutting edge. The cutting edge is cresentic in shape. There are signs of wear on the cutting edge, suggesting it has been used. There are also file marks visible on the surface of both faces, suggesting that the blade has been re-sharpened on the surface. Overall, the surface patina is smooth and dark green. A similar example, found in Dorset, can be seen on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database (DOR-422514), this example was compared to the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage by Kevin Leahy, and dated to 1600 to 1500 BC.

565100,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1001,"Bronze age copper alloy small spearhead, 52mm long, 12mm wide and 9mm thick. The object is in fair condition and weighs 14.13grams. The spearhead has a conical open shaft, (9mm in diameter)  which very gently tapers into an integral wide central mid rib running down a leaf shaped blade. This then drops sharply near the upper end to accommodate the thin blade. The edges of the blade and rib are damaged but are largely intact. The shaft is damaged, missing most of its length including the fixing hole. The section that remains has two sub-linear depressions, aligned parallel to the base, sitting on each side of the shaft, below the blade, possibly to aid fixing?  The object has an unusually short profile and wide shaft/ridge.


Dr Richard Davis has examined this object and has provided the following information,

This spearhead has a number of  interesting and rare attributes.
 
Firstly the decorative cuts on  the side of the socket. A number of side looped spearheads from the MBA have  such cuts. Drawings of these can be seen in my volume in the PBF series (Davis, R.  2012. The Early and Middle  Bronze Age spearheads of Britain. [PBF V.5]. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner).    These are no. 227 Rossington, no 276 Matlock Bath, no 307 Irlam, no 347  Waddingham, no 381 Malham Dale, no 413 Cressbrook, no 629 Eyemouth.   No 594  Harpur Hill has crosses rather than horizontal cuts. You can see that  distribution of this attribute is centred on the Peak District.
 
A couple of other points are of  interest. The midrib ends shortly below the tip, and the blade flattens at this  point. This is characteristic of the kite blade, side looped spearheads (my  Group 3) and the spearheads with wide blade, side loops and shortened midrib (my  Group 5). Both of these groups are dated to the Acton Park phase.
 
The spearhead is very short at   52mm remaining, possibly around 70mm when complete. There were some short  spearheads in the MBA, and they had rounded kite shaped blades. Examples are my  no. 151 from Nottingham at 78mm in length and no. 153 Swindon at 68mm in length.  Again these can be dated to the Acton Park phase.
 
In summary it is possible that  this spearhead originally had side loops on the lower part of the socket, which  have now broken off. This would be dated to the Acton Park and early Taunton  phases of the MBA.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,2013-05-01T23:00:00Z,,,14.13,,,9,52,1,Kevin Leahy,Wendy Scott,East Midlands,Leicestershire,Hinckley and Bosworth,Sutton Cheney,SK3900,GPS (from the finder),52.59640132,-1.42567007,LEIC-F0A3B8,,LEIC-F0A3B8.jpg,LEIC-F0A3B8 Bronze age copper alloy spearhead,Leicestershire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/LEIC-F0A3B8.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/430066.jpg

Fragment of a middle to late Bronze Age copper-alloy palstave. Only the butt remains. The fragment is triangular in profile and has a curved butt. The edges extend to form a narrow ledge at the top and bottom. The break exposes two circular indentations that appear to have been caused by air bubbles formed during the casting process. The presence of these indentations may have caused this area of the axe to have been particularly weak, thus causing the break. The break is roughly straight, but irregular enough to suggest it is not an intentional cut.

The socket is formed by a set of right angled flanges which flank the flat central area and increase in height towards the centre of the blade where they are joined by a horizontal stop ridge. The flanges are slightly damaged along the topmost edge on both sides, with heavy pitting on the outward facing sides of each flange. Immediately below the stop ridge is a shield shaped depression. The blade has inward-bowing sides which flare towards the bottom, the thickness tapering to the point where it terminates in a convex cutting edge. There is evidence of a vertical casting seam along the narrower surfaces of the object with tool-marks indicating that this was filed down during finishing. The presence of a casting seam indicates the use of a two-piece mould in production. The flanges and the shield shaped depression also carry tool marks.


Much of the palstave is heavily corroded and carries a green colouring with patches of bright blue discolouration.

From the PAS website: http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl Awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin. Dating and areas of discovery 


Date: most probably 1250-800 BC

Distribution: All over Britain and Ireland

570342,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy palstave with raised flange facets dating from the Middle Bronze Age (1500 BC - 1150 BC).


The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and an incomplete convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 96.18 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 56.31 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 3.33 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 17.36mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 29.15 mm).


The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 65.75 mm long, 16.03 mm wide, and 6.73 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving two rounded corners with a gap between. The butt is 25.13 mm wide and 5.54 mm thick. 


The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by. 


In total the palstave measures 166 mm in length, 56.54 mm wide (maximum) and 36.48 mm thick. It weighs 471.1 g.


Several casting flaws in the form of air bubbles are present on the septum. The poor quality of the casting is confirmed by an xray of the palstave which demostrated several large air bubbles within the internal structure of the palstave. XRF (X Ray Fluorescence) of the surface corrosion indicates that the palstave has a composition of 76.24% Copper (Cu), 14.62% Tin (Sn), 0.48% Lead (Pb) and 0.41% Iron (Fe).


The palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface. The palstave has been kindly cleaned stabilised by Aimee Sims (Conservation Department, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery).


Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in Savory, 1980; catalogue entries 171, 172, 175, and 263 (the Mynydd Ta-y-glannau, Cemmaes Hoard). All of these examples fit into the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II).

Discussion


The narrow-bladed looped palstaves (also termed Transitional or Late palstaves) dates the hoard to the Penard-Wilburton metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1300 - 1000 BC) (see Rowlands 1976, 38; Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160). The remaining copper alloy objects are undiagnostic metalworking waste or associated stones. The gold bar is also undiagnostic but the gold coiled bar is paralleled in Middle Bronze Age Towednack hoard, Cornwall (Hawkes 1932) which can also be provisionally dated to the Penard metalwork phase (c. 1300-1100 BC). The presence of this gold ornamentation together with the dating from the narrow-bladed looped palstave places this hoard within the gold phase of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' (Roberts 2007). The presence of gold ornaments deposited together with copper alloy palstaves during this period has been recorded in several hoards throughout southwest England such as Winterhay Green, Somerset (Rowlands 1976, 256).


Conclusion

The objects qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

1. Plain socketed axe of Type Portree - near complete. 



Length 100.5mm; surviving blade width 58.1mm; external mouth dimensions 47.2mm by 38.2mm; weight 276.3g. 



Near complete bronze socketed axe with angular face edges and sub-rectangular cross-section. The loop is missing and there is some peripheral damage to the out-turned blade edge. The axe has an onset collar below the mouth and the axe was cast with mismatching mould halves, the collar on one side being markedly deeper than on the other. The surface has a dark grey-green and black patina, with small patches of light green corrosion around the mouth and along the blade edge.



2. Ribbed socketed axe fragment 



Surviving length 42.8mm; surviving width 23.5mm; weight 27.4g. 



Small mouth and partial face fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset collar. Two narrow raised ribs are visible, descending from the underside of the collar down the long axis of the surviving upper face. The fragment is markedly bent near the lower face break, suggesting deliberate force in breakage during antiquity. The surface displays a dark grey-green patina.



3. Ribbed socketed axe fragment 



Surviving Length 60.6mm; surviving width 23.1mm; weight 55.1g. 



Small mouth and upper body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze. The mouth moulding is out-turned but poorly defined, the mouth top uneven and imperfectly cast. Two raised narrow ribs extend down one upper face, while a single rib survives on the reverse axe face. The other rib is represented only partially by a short narrow rib on the edge of the break. This fragment has been bent in antiquity, one surviving face section being pressed together against the other, while the lower face break is also distorted inwards. The surface has a grey-green patina.



4. Plain or faceted socketed axe fragment 



Surviving length 37.4mm; surviving width 40.4mm; weight 27.2g. 



Small upper face and side fragment of a plain or faceted socketed axe of bronze. The mouth has an onset and well-defined collar. The original outer face has been deliberately bent inside out, making the original inner socket face convex and appear to be the outer surface, on first view. The surface a dark grey-green patina.



5. Socketed axe fragment 



Surviving length 35.5mm; surviving width 22.7mm; weight 33.3g. 



Small middle face and side fragment of a socketed axe of bronze, with a prominent casting seam. No ribs are visible on the surviving face. The fragment has been forcibly distorted and broken in antiquity and there is twisting and inner face cracking evident. The surface has a dark grey-green patina. 6.-8. Three fragments of a single and incomplete Plain Pegged Spearhead Estimated original length of complete spearhead 270-300mm Combined surviving weight 134.7g. This was originally a large spearhead of Plain Pegged type, with a lanceolate or flame-shaped blade.



6. Spearhead socket and lower blade fragment 



Length 96.4mm; external diameter of socket 25.8-26.1mm; maximum width 32.0mm; weight 67.3g. 



Socket and lower blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze. The circular socket has slightly convex sides, giving it an external barrel-shaped profile. Two circular peg holes (each 5.5-6.5mm in diameter) are located 34.5-34.7mm from the mouth end of the socket. The spear blade has a pronounced and stepped blade bevel, the blade edge merging with the socket at a shallow and even angle. The lower blade wall thickness varies markedly on each face, suggesting casting imperfections. The break is uneven and occurred in antiquity, creating a small tear on one lower blade face. Areas of bronze metal are evident, with patches of dark grey and dark green patination also present.



7. Spearhead blade fragment 



Surviving length 65.4mm; surviving width 39.9mm; maximum thickness 12.1mm; weight 46.6g. 



Middle blade fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead tip fragment 8 (below). The spearhead has a prominent mid-ridge, which is lozenge shaped in cross-section, and a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. The fragment is bent at both ends, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. Impact scars on one lower face suggests that the spearhead was bent and broken by being struck with a blunt bladed implement. The blade edges are badly corroded and damaged with pale green corrosion surfaces. The faces have a grey-green patination, one face being well preserved with crisp definition and lustre and the other being markedly rough, with a dull corrosion surface.



8. Spearhead blade tip fragment 



Surviving length 54.2mm; surviving width 23.5mm; maximum thickness 9.7mm; weight 20.6g. 



This is a tip fragment of a Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a probable join with spearhead middle blade fragment 7 (above). The tip fragment has a prominent mid-ridge, tapering at the end to form a solid tip, also with a pronounced and stepped blade bevel. Bending is evident near the break, suggesting deliberate breakage in antiquity. One blade edge and side is badly damaged and corroded with pale green and unstable corrosion surfaces, which also extends across one side of the break point. The surface has a grey-green patina.



9. Penannular bracelet - fragment with terminal 



Surviving length 68.6mm; diameter of terminal 16.7 by 14.5mm; hoop diameter 5.4mm by 5.1mm; weight 22.9g. 



A fragment of a bronze penannular bracelet with an expanded oval-shaped terminal, representing between one third and one half of the original bracelet. The hoop has a near circular cross-section, though with slight flattening along the inner circumference, and was broken in antiquity. The bracelet had an internal front to back diameter of approximately 50mm and it is estimated that it once had an internal side to side diameter of 71-76mm. The bracelet surfaces have a green patina.



10. Ingot or recycled bronze fragment-- near complete 



Maximum height 55.5mm; diameter of base 74.0mm; maximum width 77.4mm; weight 670.4g.



Bronze ingot or re-smelted bronze fragment. The molten metal was cooled inside the base of a ceramic vessel, set into the ground surface at an angle, so cooling into one half of the base and up one side of the interior vessel side-surface. The vessel once had an external base diameter of 105-115mm. The upper cooling surface is rough and irregular, while the underside surfaces have surface vesicles, representing air bubbles in the molten metal as it cooled. The base surface is slightly concave, while the side diverges and become wider with a convex profile, taking the contours of the internal vessel surface. A small fragment of the whole piece was removed in antiquity near the top of the body side. The upper cooling surface has a green patina, while the underside has large areas of light green surface corrosion with small areas of dark-green patina surviving.



11. Plano-convex ingot/cake fragment 



Surviving length 40.7mm; max. surviving width 62.7mm; max. thickness 13.3mm; weight 119.6g. 



Plano-convex ingot/cake fragment of bronze, representing one long-axis end of an irregular oval-shaped cake. The upper cooling surface is irregular and uneven. The lower surface is convex in shape, though uneven with slight flattening near the break, which was made in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



12. Single-runner casting-jet - complete 



Maximum height 29.1mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 35.2mm by 27.2mm; length of runner 13.7 mm; max. width of runner 12.5mm; weight 50.6g. 



A complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a near flat upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards steeply with a convex form on one side and a concave form on the other. A single, narrow and prominent runner extends from the central base of the reservoir aligned parallel with the long-axis of the reservoir. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



13. Single-runner casting-jet - complete 



Maximum height 31.4mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 30.2mm by 23.3mm; length of runner 6.5mm; width of runner 21.1mm; weight 50.5g. 



A complete single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough, uneven and concave upper surface. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a straight to slightly convex profile. A wide and single runner extends from under the base of the reservoir, being the same width as the base width of the reservoir. The runner has been snapped off just a short distance (6.5mm) from the reservoir base. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



14. Small single-runner casting-jet - complete 



Maximum height 16.0mm; top surface diameter of reservoir 23.5mm by 19.2 mm; weight 13.9g. 



A small single-runner casting-jet of bronze. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan, with a rough, uneven upper surface, with a significant hollowing at its centre. The reservoir tapers inwards at the underside with a slightly convex profile. Prominent but thin seams of metal have extruded between joins in the upper mould and parallel with the long axis of the jet. The reservoir has been snapped off near its base, with no clear runner stub evident. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



15. Four-runner casting-jet - half fragment 



Maximum height 27.1mm; top surface length 52.2mm; maximum surviving width 24.8mm; length of runners 19.1mm & 13.8mm; maximum width of runners at base 13.2 & 13.4mm; weight 47.2g. 



Half fragment of a large four-runner casting jet of bronze, created during the casting of a South Wales type socketed axe. The reservoir is oval shaped in surface plan with a rough and uneven upper surface. The reservoir tapers and is shallow with a central perforation and uneven depth, deepest in proximity to the two surviving runner stubs. The runners are wide and prominent. Both runners are broken below the base of the reservoir. The break lines have even corrosion suggesting they occurred in antiquity. The surfaces have a dark grey-green patination.



16. Dried out wood fragments (3) 



Surviving lengths: 56.3mm, 44.9mm & 32.7mm; maximum surviving widths 11.0mm, 11.8mm & 14.7mm; weights 1.1g, 0.6g & 0.4g (combined 2.1g). 



Three small and elongate wood fragments, showing severe shrinking, cracking and warping, due to the drying out process inevitably speeded up by the removal of the wood from its burial context. Careful inspection under the microscope reveals no visible evidence of working and shaping of the wood, however the drying out and shrinking process hinders the identification of possible shape, form and working evidence. The wood fragments merit retaining and safe care as material for possible future radiocarbon dating samples and the potential for independent absolute dating of the burial of the hoard.



Metallurgical analysis (Mary Davis) 



Qualitative and non-destructive surface analysis was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken with 40 kV and 3A for 100 live seconds. There was no surface preparation of the artefacts; the relatively high kV setting would have allowed penetration of the X-rays through corrosion layers, and resulting spectra could be compared with those from similar artefacts, but would not allow for the production of quantitative data.



Results: The ingot or recycled bronze fragment (No. 10) and plano-convex ingot or cake fragment (No. 11) were both found to be of leaded bronze in composition.","Discussion (Adam Gwilt & Simone L Johnson)



The fifteen metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).



The near complete socketed axe (No. 1) most resembles a plain form known as Type Portree, which has a flaring onset collar, with a sub-rectangular body section, with concave sides and an expanded cutting edge (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 184). Parallel examples have been found within secure Ewart Park hoards from Pendoylan, Vale of Glamorgan and Llanddewi Rhydderch, Monmouthshire (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 276 & Fig. 41; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 187; Green 1985, 276-80, Fig. 5 & Pl. 5; Northover unpublished, H.79 & H.119). Plain socketed axes of slightly different forms have also been found within a further eleven hoards from Wales with secure Ewart Park associations, including the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire, Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire hoards (Briggs & Williams 1995, 46 & Fig. 4.1; Northover unpublished H. 38, 76 & 140; Wear unpublished). It is possible that the plain or faceted socketed axe fragment (No. 4) could be another example of Type Portree, however it is not entirely diagnostic and could equally have once belonged to a faceted axe of Type Gillespie (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 191).



Two socketed axe fragments belonged to ribbed socketed axes (Nos. 2 & 3), however insufficient survives to identify them with certainty to type. However, the narrow but pronounced collars, without upper or lower mouldings and parallel ribs, suggest that these fragments once probably belonged to South Wales Type or South Wales Variant socketed axes (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2; Needham 1981; 1990, 38-41; Northover unpublished, 259). This probable attribution is further strengthened by the four-runner casting jet (No. 15) which was definitely created during the casting of a South Wales Type socketed axe, a four-runner casting technology being a distinctive and diagnostic technology for this particular socketed axe form (Needham 1981, 27; Northover unpublished, 259). South Wales type socketed axes are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), though they are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and southern England (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66). Six examples have been found in the Myddfai, Carmarthenshire hoard (Briggs & Williams 1995), with further single examples in the Margam, Neath-Port Talbot and Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoards (Northover unpublished H. 76; Wear unpublished; Gwilt et al unpublished). Four-runner casting jets have been discovered within a number of secure Ewart Park hoards from south east Wales: St Mellons (Cardiff), Llangybi (Monmouthshire), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Cowbridge, St Nicholas and Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan) (e.g. Stanton 1984; Gwilt 2004; unpublished; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished).



The three spearhead fragments (Nos. 6-8) were once part of a single and large Plain Pegged spearhead approximately 27-30cm long. A similar long-bladed spearhead is known in the St Fagans, Cardiff hoard (Savory 1980, 120, Cat. 273 & Fig. 40). The mid-blade and tip fragments (Nos. 7 & 8) are joining fragments, though the mid to lower blade section of this spearhead is missing. Plain Pegged spearheads as an artefact class generally span in date from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of similar Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800BC. In Wales, there are twelve other known hoards of Ewart Park date which include Plain Pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen, Manorbier (both Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (both Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llantarnam (Torfaen), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick unpublished a; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished). The barrel-shaped profile of the socket of the St Ishmael spearhead is a late feature, generally observed amongst spearheads in Ewart Park hoards (Richard Davis pers comm), for example in the Wick Park (Somerset), Heathery Burn Cave (Durham), St Fagans (Cardiff), St Nicholas Llantwit Major and Cowbridge (all Vale of Glamorgan) hoards (Britton 1968; McNeil 1973, 48-9 & Figs. 6-7; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats 273 & 281, Figs 40 & 42) . The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, this spearhead is thought on stylistic grounds to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).



The penannular bracelet or armlet fragment (No. 9) may be identified as of British, rather than Irish form, by comparison with other gold and bronze bracelet types (Eogan 1994, 85-88). Its precise characteristics include a near round-sectioned hoop but with a slight flattening of the inner circumference, an expanding terminal with slight inward expansion but more pronounced outward expansion and with a solid, flat ended but oval shaped terminal. This would seem to share characteristics with Covesea type / British Variety 7 and British Variety 9 bracelets (Coles 1959-60; Eogan 1994, 85). In Wales, the two closest parallels are a bronze example from The Breiddin hillfort, Powys and a bronze bracelet in the St Nicholas hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Coombs 1991, 136-8, Cat. 159, Fig. 56; Gwilt et al 2005, 55, Appendix 3, 13 & 15; Gwilt unpublished). The former has a thicker hoop, but shares a slight internal expansion of the terminal but with a more pronounced external expansion, while the latter has an oval-sectioned hoop and an oval shaped terminal, but expanding equally both internally and externally. The bracelet from The Breiddin was associated with a Late Bronze Age hillfort occupation phase (Musson 1991, 177-8) and was generally associated with metalwork of Ewart Park date (Coombs 1991, 132-41), while the St Nicholas hoard also has secure Ewart Park associations.



Casting jets (Nos. 12-15) only become common discoveries within hoard associations during the Late Bronze Age. These are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, with thirteen other hoards of secure Ewart Park date from Wales now known to include them: the Penwyllt (Powys), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), Llantwit Major, Penarth, Cowbridge, St Nicholas, Llancarfan, Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Llantarnam (Torfaen), St Mellons (Cardiff), Glascoed and Llangybi (both Monmouthshire) hoards (Savory 1980, 120-22, Cats. 274, 281 284; Stanton 1984; Gwilt, 2004, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 & 4; 2008; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished; in prep; Gwilt et al, unpublished).



Plano-convex ingots (No. 11) of copper and bronze are common components of Ewart Park hoards. Over 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan 1 and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex bronze ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). The Manorbier, Pembrokeshire hoard contained eight copper ingot fragments as a major component of the hoard (Gwilt et al unpublished), while the Freshwater Bay, Pembrokeshire hoard included twenty three fragments of plano-convex ingot fragments of copper (Murphy unpublished; Northover unpublished). The ingot or recycled bronze fragment cooled in a ceramic vessel (No. 10) has been shown to be of leaded bronze composition, a typical Late Bronze Age signature and consistent with the other artefacts and the plano-convex ingot fragment. Inclusion of such material is consistent with the frequent inclusion of casting bi-products and ingot material in hoards of Ewart Park date (1000-800BC).



The small dried out wood fragments (No. 16 above) were directly associated with the hoard, having been found next to the near complete socketed axe (No. 1). Although it now proves difficult to detect clear evidence for the deliberate working of these fragments, in part dues to the drying out process, nevertheless it may be possible to identify the species of the wood through micro-sampling and microscopy work. In addition, this organic material could provide valuable radiocarbon dating samples, in order to gain independent dating evidence for the burial of the hoard.



The archaeological findspot investigation, undertaken with the assistance of the finder, enabled the details of the reported depths and an account of the relative positioning of artefacts to be clarified. Hand excavation of a test pit over the location of the rediscovered findspot indicated that the metal detector pit, created when the artefacts were retrieved from the ground, had removed all evidence of the original burial context. No further artefacts were discovered during the archaeological investigation. However, the base of a small pit feature was discovered adjacent to the location of the hoard. This contained an undisturbed fill incorporating occasional flecks of charcoal - suggesting human activity rather than being naturally derived. The evidence suggests that the hoard was originally buried as a single closed deposit of directly associated artefacts in a single small pit, one of a pair of isolated pits, seemingly located remote from any known Late Bronze Age settlements. A search of the Heritage Environment Record for the locality indicated the existence of possible Bronze Age standing stones a few hundred metres to the north east of the findspot, although their prehistoric date remains questionable (Marion Page pers comm). However, it seemed probable that the siting of the hoard was, in part, selected for its landscape location, with its dramatic coastal views.

The axe is a Schmidt and Burgess (1981, pg. 65-8; pl. 30-1) Type Bandon, Variant Swinton, e.g. nos. 347-80. The surface of the axe is corroded and worn and appears to be displaying active copper corrosion, rendering identification of the surface, and any possible decoration, impossible.


The axe measures 84mm in length, 34mm in width and 11mm in thickness. It weighs 78.94g. Such axes were current in the Willerby Wold phase of the early Bronze Age, currently dated circa 1900-1700 BC.","This object was reported to Dr Paul Sealey, of Colchester and Ipswich Museums, and images of the axehead were obtained by scanning the object which were supplied to the FLO for recording. As a result the record may fall below the usual standards for objects reported to the FLO.

572333,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"The hoard comprises two associated Bronze Age artefacts:



Plain pegged spearhead fragment



Maximum surviving length 61.3mm; maximum surviving blade width 18.3mm; maximum surviving socket height 13.0mm; maximum blade thickness near break 8.0mm. Weight 22.8g. 



This is the lower blade side and upper socket side of a bronze socketed spearhead. The blade edge has a defined bevel approximately 5mm wide. The interior of the blade is slightly hollowed out immediately adjacent to where the central and circular rib cavity once existed. The blade edge merges with the socket with a shallow and gradual angle, with no nick or break of slope. The even convex curve of the lower blade suggests the spearhead once had a leaf or flame shaped form. The fragment has a dark brown patina and appears to have been coated with oil since discovery.



Single-runner casting jet 



Maximum top surface length 33.8mm; maximum top surface width 26.8mm; depth 23.1mm; length of runner near break 15.4mm; width runner near break 3.9mm. Weight 50.7g. 



This is a single-runner bronze casting jet, oval in plan, with a rough and uneven tope surface. One underside long axis has a near straight profile with a lower inward tapering step, while the opposing side is more steeply undercut, with a slightly concave profile. The underside break is worn and eroded, making it difficult to establish the original dimensions of the casting runner with any precision. The patina is dark green with lighter green edges and breaks.","The plain pegged spearhead fragment can be confidently identified as of Middle to Late Bronze Age date and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). The shape of the surviving blade edge is consistent with either a leaf shaped or flame shaped blade. In Wales, early examples of similar plain pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 950-800BC. In Wales, there are eleven other known hoards of Ewart Park date which included plain pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen (Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (all Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; 2008; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick unpublished; Gwilt et al, in prep). The wooden hafts of a number of plain pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to this period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, on a balance of probability, this spearhead is thought most likely to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 950BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).





Casting jets only become common discoveries within hoard associations during the Late Bronze Age. These are the excess reservoirs of metal created in the cavity at the top of the mould during the casting process. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date (950-800BC), with thirteen other hoards of secure Ewart Park date from Wales now known to include them: the Penwyllt (Powys), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Penarth, Cowbridge, St Nicholas, Llancarfan, Brigam Farm (all Vale of Glamorgan), Tal y Garn 2 (Rhondda Cynon Taf), St Mellons (Cardiff), Glascoed and Llangybi (both Monmouthshire) hoards (Savory 1980, 120-22, Cats. 274, 281 284; Stanton 1984; Gwilt, 2004, Appendix 1, Nos. 3 & 4; Gwilt & Lodwick 2004; unpublished; Gwilt et al, unpublished; Gwilt et al, in prep). Therefore, on a balance of probability, the casting jet is thought most likely to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (950-800BC).





To summarise, plain pegged spearheads and casting jets are contemporary in their dating to between 1020-800BC, during the Blackmoor and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age, although a Ewart Park date (950-800BC) is the most likely, on a balance of probability.

572343,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-950,-750,"Two bronze socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date 1.0 South Wales Variant Type socketed axe Length 101.0mm; blade width 50.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 354.9g. This is a complete bronze socketed axe of slender and rectangular form. The mouth moulding is deeper (approx. 10mm), thicker and less outsplayed than is typical of the type and the loop extends from the underside of the moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped mouth in plan view with four runner scars around the top surface, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent and concave sides expanding slightly near the blade edge. Three longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding down both faces of the axe, on one face being parallel and on the other slightly convergent. Both local prominences and gaps in the ribs suggest the re-use of a previously well used mould set. Casting flashes down the sides of the axe have been finished by rapid hammering, though remain prominent. There is little visible evidence of blade preparation on the one surviving blade bevel, the other original surface having been removed by corrosion. The axe has been deliberately damaged in antiquity and prior to burial, as evidenced by three impact scars, two on the mid-face on one side and one on the mid-face of the other. The shape of the scars suggests impact with another thick bladed implement, such as an axe. The axe has a grey-green patina, with small areas of lighter green patination and corrosion around the mouth and blade edges. 2.0 South Wales Type socketed axe Surviving length 79.2mm; surviving blade width 42.0mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 205.9g. This is a virtually complete bronze socketed axe, which is small and rectangular in cross-section. The blade edge and bevel has been badly damaged and corroded. The axe has an outsplayed mouth moulding and a high loop. The external mouth is sub-oval in plan view however the internal edge is rectangular in shape. Four prominent and un-filed runner stubs protrude around the moth top, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent but straight sides, widening slightly at the balde end. Three very prominent and near parallel longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding down both faces of the axe. Gaps and variable heights and rib definition on one face suggest the re-use of a well used mould piece. The face edges on both faces are slightly raised (though less prominent than the ribs) giving a pronounced angular profile. Prominent casting flashes down the sides indicate minimal preparation after casting by rapid hammering. The blade edge is damaged, though striations on the blade bevels and parallel with the blade edge indicate some preparation of the blade. The axe has a dark green patination, with areas of pale green corrosion around the mouth and blade edge. On one upper face, there are small patches of blue-green corrosion, consistent with possible burning of the axe before burial. These two bronze socketed axes were buried during the Ewart Park pahse of the Late Bronze Age and date to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). South Wales Type axes and their Variants were commonly made and used in south east Wales at this time (McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980; Needham 1981). Over 30 hoards containing more than 140 examples are known from this region (e.g. Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), making it the core area within Britain for their burial in hoards. In Monmouthshire, the Llangwm, Glascoed, Coed Ithel, Llanddewi Rhydderch, Llantilio Pertholey, Llanvihangel Gobion and St Arvans hoards contain examples of these ribbed socketed axes (e.g. Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 2). A further forty single examples of South Wales type axe finds are now also known from south east Wales, with a further fifteen from the rest of Wales. However, they were also made and used across south western and central southern England, either as minor components of hoards or as single finds. A few examples circulated as far as northern Britain, Ireland and northern France (McNeil 1973, Appendix 63-4; Moore 1978, Appendix I, 61-5; Needham 1981, Appendix, 56-66). The discovery of two South Wales Type socketed axes in close proximity (approximately 2.5m apart from each other), strongly suggests that they were once buried as a hoard in direct association with each other. Their slight dispersal is most convincingly explained as caused by recent ploughing activity, leading to their dislodgement from an original burial context and dispersal into the overlying ploughsoil. Archaeological investigation of the approximate area of the find-spot for the larger socketed axe (No. 1 above) failed to reveal evidence for the recent detector pit, in which the axe was found. However, the recently disturbed upper ploughsoil was observed to be 0.25-0.30m deep here, while the larger axe was reported as found at a depth of 0.17-0.20m . Even allowing for the slight thickening of the ploughsoil caused by recent ploughing activity (i.e. loosening and aeration of the soil), it is likely that the three recent detector pits were all almost entirely restricted to within the ploughsoil layer. This provides additional evidence in support of the interpretation that the axes had recently been disturbed from their original burial context - probably a small Bronze Age pit - and dragged upwards into the ploughsoil during a recent ploughing event.",,3,Copper alloy,,Donated to museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2011-09-30T23:00:00Z,,2011W17,,,,,,,2,Mark Lodwick,Adam Gwilt,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Trellech United,SO5109,,51.77751,-2.71163,NMGW-4D8933,,Axespresentation.JPG,Late Bronze Age associated socketed axes,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/Axespresentation.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/436025.jpg
572421,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A bronze socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date and a worked and hook-shaped metal fragment



1. Faceted and socketed axe



(Dimensions: length 91.2mm; surviving blade width 43.6mm; external mouth dimensions 36.8 by 34.4mm, internal mouth dimensions 26.9 by 24.2mm; width below loop 32.8mm; height of collar 18.2mm; depth of socket approximately 67.0mm; surviving weight (after removal of haft fragment but before conservation) 183.9g).



This is a near complete, slender and faceted axe with an octagonal cross-section. The axe has a deep octagonal shaped collar, with a slightly flaring or trumpet-shaped mouth, which is sub-octagonal in plan shape. The loop is placed low down, the upper end emerging from the lower margin of the collar. The sides are near straight but slightly divergent and the blade edge does not widen markedly. A casting seam is evident down both sides of the axe, only partially removed and flattened by hammering or filing down. Striations on the blade bevel, both parallel and at right angles to the blade edge, suggest that the blade was sharpened. Areas of eroded surface damage are evident on one collar face and upper blade, with similar damage also to the blade edge and on the non-loop lower blade side. The axe has a dark brown patina, the eroded surfaces being mid to dark green.



2. Hook-shaped base metal fragment 



(Dimensions: maximum length 57.0mm; maximum curved width 37.5mm; surviving top width 12.8mm; surviving length at top 16.5mm; surviving width 20mm from tapering tip end 9.5mm; surviving thickness 20mm from tapering tip end 6.7mm; internal hollow mouth dimensions 11.5 by 7.6mm; depth of top hollow cavity approximately 9.0mm; surviving weight 40.3g.)



This is a differentially corroded hook-shaped dense base-metal object, with a hollowed out and sub-rectangular shaped top and a tapering narrow tip end with an oval-shaped cross-section. In form and size it resembles the tusk of a pig or wild boar. Original, but now longitudinally cracking surfaces survive on the interior concave curved side however original surfaces are almost entirely missing on the exterior convex shaped side. Microscope examination of the exterior surface suggests a small area of original surface survives approximately 18-22mm from the tapering tip end, indicating that the object was probably originally tapered in shape and not broken or differentially eroded here. The original surfaces have a dark grey black patina, while the corroded surfaces are a mottled light to mid-grey colour.



3. Wooden axe haft fragment (& small wood fragments) 



(Dimensions: maximum surviving length 51.8mm; width at top end approximately 24.0mm; base length 19.0mm; base width 3.1mm; surviving weight after drying 4.3g).



A shaped wooden axe haft fragment, fitted to the contours of the axe socket interior. The haft tapers in the axis parallel to the blade edge, though remains long and narrow at the lower end. The mouth end of the wood fragment has a damaged and concave surface, compression, fragmentation and twisting contributing to the loss of original shape here. This may have occurred recently, when the finder removed and re-inserted the haft fragment soon after discovery, or it could alternatively relate to ancient impact damage to the wood in the socket by a round and blunt ended tool.","Discussion (Adam Gwilt)



The faceted and socketed axe may be identified as of Type Gillespie (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 191-4), equating with Class 9A socketed axes in Ireland (Eogan 2000, 62-81). These may be confidently dated by secure hoard associations to the late Wilburton and Ewart Park phases (late Bishopsland and Dowris phases in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age, between 1050 and 800BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 193-4; Eogan 2000, 80; Needham 1996, 134-7; Needham et al 1997; Northover unpublished 267-9). In Wales, the Llanarmon yn Iâl (Denbighshire), Llansantffraed Cwmdeuddwr (Powys), Llanddewi Rhydderch and Llangwm (both Monmouthshire), Old Kemeys (Newport), Fairwater (Cardiff) and Welsh St Donats (Vale of Glamorgan) hoards, all of Ewart Park and Late Bronze Age date, contain single examples of Type Gillespie faceted axes (Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 276, 278 & 282; Green 1983; Gwilt & Macdonald 2000; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Cats. 1 &7; Northover unpublished, Hoards 49,67,119 &145). The survival of wooden haft fragments inside the socket of the axe raises the possibility that the axe was deposited in the ground complete with its haft still attached, although it is equally likely that the haft was broken prior to deposition, with only the socket fragment entering the ground at the time of burial. The wooden haft may be species identified at future date and a wood sample may be taken, from which an independent radiocarbon date for the axe may be obtained.





Careful examination of the hook-shaped tin object suggests it was deliberately shaped as an attachment or handle to a larger object, although the possibilities of it being an unusually shaped adornment, talisman or ingot cannot be discounted. The hollowed-out, widened and sub-rectangular shaped top would appear to have been the point of attachment to a larger composite object, the head slotting into a peg or projecting fitting. Observation of the narrowing end with a microscope gives tentative support for it having been deliberately shaped and tapered, rather than the outcome of differential corrosion and damage since burial. This suggests that it was only secured at one, rather than two ends. It is possible that the tin hook was once the hidden core of a handle or attachment with a sheet or cast bronze outer surface. This may have improved the weighting of the handle and the mode of securing it to the larger object, or it may have been added for reasons more closely linked with the wider meanings and symbolisms attached to tin as a special metal with specific properties. The discovery of the hook-shaped tin object within the same detector pit and less than 18cm from the socketed axe is consistent with a close and direct association. On a balance of probability, this favours their burial together at the same time during the Late Bronze Age, as opposed to being a fortuitous association of an ancient with a tin object of more recent manufacture in historical times.



Tin was an essential metal during the Bronze Age, alloyed with copper to form bronze, with the most likely source of tin being located in Cornwall (e.g. Pearce 1983, 92-7). As such, it would have been an important and valued exchanged material, requiring long-distance transport to bronze casting centres across Britain in some quantities. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, much tin would have been carried alloyed within existing old bronze objects and scrap destined for recycling, however some was also transported as metal fragments of irregular shape and as ingots, although the latter still prove difficult to date with accuracy (Way 1859, 38-40; Smith 1872, 435-39; Evans 1881, 424-6; Pearce 1983, 384 & 407, Cat. 52) and remain remarkably rare archaeological finds.



A preliminary literature search has produced two known Late Bronze Age hoards with objects or fragments of tin directly associated. The Llangwyllog (Anglesey) hoard included a fragment of tin, interpreted as possibly a damaged or miscast ornament, and dates to the contemporary Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Stanley 1865; Way 1866; Lynch 1991, 242-6 & Fig. 68; Northover 1997, 250; unpublished 274-86, Hoard 13). The Auchtertyre (Morayshire, Scotland) hoard, comprising a bronze socketed axe, two bronze spearheads and seven penannular bronze armlets, also included four fragments of tin (Smith 1872, 435-9; Evans 1881, 425; Coles 1959-60, 120-1). These were oval-sectioned and curved as if once part of a curved bar or ring, with one illustrated example suggesting it was slightly wider and thicker at one end (Smith 1872, 435). Unfortunately these no longer survive in the collections of the National Museums of Scotland (T. Cowie pers comm.), so their precise form cannot be compared with the hook-shaped tin fragment from Treuddyn. When chemically analysed soon after their discovery, the tin fragments were found to be made of a tin-lead alloy (78.66% tin, 21.34% lead). The socketed axe in the Auchtertyre hoard is of similar form of faceted axe (Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham) as the Treuddyn example and also of the same date (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 206-7, Cat. 1234). The two socketed spearheads are of Late Bronze Age form and the Covesea type bronze armlets may be equated with the Ewart Park tradition of the Late Bronze Age (Coles 1959-60, 34-5, 54-5; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 206-7 & Pl. 144C; Eogan 1994, 85).



Objects of tin dating to the Late Bronze Age have been discovered in a number of watery places in Britain and Wales and probably associated with votive and religious practice. For example, sixteen tin objects were reported from a votive context near a timber causeway into a watery fen at Flag Fen in Cambridgeshire (Coombs 2001, 291). These included wheel models, purse-shaped ornaments, rings and beads, the former finding close parallel with Late Bronze Age examples in Switzerland (Northover 1997, 250). A further object of possible Late Bronze Age date from this site was a shale bracelet with inlayed insets of 'white metal' (lead or tin) in a zig-zag design (Coombs 2001, 280, Cat. 257 & Fig. 10.10). Recent analytical research of a large penannular gold ring of Late Bronze Age date, held in The British Museum collections, has shown that the gold is plated onto a core of tin, containing 6% lead Meeks et al 2008, 14-17, 23-4, Fig 1.xvii). A decorated grooved strip of tin was discovered near a timber causeway in a wet palaeochannel context, and securely dated to the Late Bronze Age, at Caldicot, Monmouthshire (Northover 1997, 250; Nayling & Caseldine 1997, 265-8). The Caergwrle bowl, in the form of a boat model is made of Kimmeridge shale and has decorative tin insets forming wave and oar motifs, and also applied to the rim as a ground metal, onto which shield motifs could be stamped (Davis pers comm.). These were covered with decorative gold foil. This unique artefact may be dated to the slightly earlier Penard phase at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC). It was discovered in boggy ground next to the River Alyn near Caergwrle Castle in 1823 and was probably a carefully placed religious or votive gift (e.g. Barnwell 1875; Savory 1980, 127, Cat. 306; Davis 2011). To conclude this rapid overview of tin finds, discovered as fragments, ingots, in hoard associations and in religious watery deposits, a Late Bronze Age and contemporary association of a faceted bronze socketed axe with a hook-shaped tin object is plausible and consistent with the wider evidence.



Further support for the Treuddyn find representing a genuine Late Bronze Age association can be gathered by comparison with the content of two other Ewart Park hoards known within the region. The Llanarmon-yn-Iâl (Denbighshire) hoard, discovered just a few kilometres to the north-west of the Treuddyn find in 1982, comprised two folded gold bracelets, a gold finger-ingot and two gold link fragments carefully placed inside the socket a large faceted bronze axe of Type Gillespie (Green 1983). Similarly, in 2002, a small hoard was found near Rossett (Wrexham) and comprised four cut fragments of Irish gold bracelets carefully placed inside a slender faceted bronze axe of Type Meldreth and associated with a fine tanged bronze knife (Gwilt et al 2005). The repeated association of gold and tin - highly valued Bronze Age metals - with specially selected faceted axes (in all three cases), appears to represent a remarkably consistent and specific regional practice. The account of the discovery of the Llanarmon-yn-Iâl hoard includes the tantalising observation that 'tiny fragments of lead ore (galena)' were also found inside the socket of the axe, but were discarded by the finder at the time of discovery (Green 1983, 384). In the light of the Treuddyn tin discovery, one wonders if the fragments were misidentified and were instead tin, a dense metal with a similar appearance to lead in corroded (white metal) state, although brighter and more silvery than galena or lead in fresh state. The survival of wood in the socket of the axe indicates that the tin fragment was buried next to the axe, rather than being placed within its socket and later disturbed. Whether or not this is true, the association of either lead or tin with gold, and deposited with a bronze faceted axe, suggests that mixed metals, sometimes in raw, unalloyed and unformed state, were valued and deliberately selected as appropriate for burial. Further examples of gold bracelets found carefully cut or folded and placed inside bronze socketed axes are known from Ireland, south Wales and Cornwall giving a shared western British and Irish patterning (Gwilt et al 2005, 42-3) and the north-east Wales cluster is a more specific practice and clustering within this wider pattern. A caveat to this is the observation that the Treuddyn find differs from the other two hoards and the others cited in one respect: here, the tin object was not placed inside the socket of the faceted axe, but beside it, since the survival of wood in the base of the socket occupies too much of the internal cavity to fit the hook-shaped tin object aswell.



The siting of the Treuddyn find, on dry-land at high altitude (295-300m OD) and near the headwaters of the Rivers Terrig and Cegidog, is remarkably similar to the siting of the Llanarmon-yn-Iâl hoard in the upland land-block overlooking the headwaters of the River Terrig and the upper reaches of the River Alyn. These rivers are both tributaries of the River Alyn. The Rossett hoard was found, further east and lower down the River Alyn's course in low-lying land and less than 2km from its confluence with the River Dee (Gwilt et al 2005, 28, Fig. 1). This river associated patterning, adds further plausibility to the suggestion that the Treuddyn faceted axe and hook-shaped tin object are a probable Late Bronze Age association. It lends weight to the suggestion that deliberately selected locations (river sources and confluences), with similar social, cosmological and religious meanings and associations, were chosen for the burial of metalwork hoards in this region and at this specific time during the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC).

1. Flat axe - Type Migdale, probable Variant Biggar (Class 3F) 



Dimensions: surviving length 142.9mm; surviving blade width 58.6mm; surviving butt width21.1mm; maximum thickness 8.2mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 253.9g.



This is a largely complete but severely corroded bronze flat axe with no surviving original surfaces. It has a narrow, tapering and rounded butt and the axe has a slender profile, whose sides are not markedly concave and curved. One side is irregular to slightly concave and the other now appears slightly convex, with little widening and change of angle at the blade end. The blade edge is shallowly curved in plan view. The edges of the sides appear rounded with no surviving evidence of hammered low-flanges. There is no evidence of a median bevel and the blade is lenticular in side-section (i.e. with no marked central thickening or significant angle change in the blade thickness). On one butt end, an alloy imperfection shows as a curvilinear surface ridge, which has been differentially resistant to surface corrosion and erosion. The axe is now very fragile with pitted surfaces and a light green patination.



2. Developed Flat Axe of Type Aylesford (Low-flanged Class 4B axe) 



Dimensions: surviving length 129.3mm; surviving blade width 59.7mm; surviving butt width 26.0mm; maximum thickness (at median bevel) 12.5mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 240.5g.



This is a largely complete Developed flat axe or low-flanged axe of bronze, with damaged blade edges, butt and sides, which are in a very fragile condition. Although the butt is damaged, it is narrow and square ended or slightly arched, tapering at the end in side-view. The butt end is narrow with slightly divergent and straight sides. The angle of divergence becomes more pronounced below the line of the median bevel and down the blade end, though the sides remain straight. This gives a slightly angled side profile to this axe. There is no evident widening or recurving of the sides near the blade edge, although the whole of the blade edge and much of the blade bevel is missing. It is estimated that the original length of the axe was approximately 140-150mm, while the original blade width was probably approximately 65mm. The surviving original surfaces on the sides are slightly rounded, but very unstable, the face edges having been hammered up slightly, to provide low-flanges. The axe is thickest at the median bevel, which is straight. The axe is decorated from butt to blade on both sides with continuous and linear rain pattern decoration, running in parallel with the long axis of the axe. Large areas of original surfaces survive, but are very unstable - having a dark green patination. The damaged blade end, butt and sides have a light green patina.","Discussion (Adam Gwilt, Mark Lodwick and Marion Page)



One of the flat axes (No. 1 above) may be identified as a Type Migdale flat axe. Its narrow butt and slender proportion, suggest that it is most closely paralleled by the narrower variant, known in northern Britain as Variant Biggar (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 46-8). Though it is felt probable that this is a flat axe, which never had hammered low flanges, it is not possible to be absolutely certain, due to the lack of survival of original surfaces. Its narrow butt, slender form and modest blade width, combine to indicate this is a Class 3F axe of the southern British typological scheme (Needham 1985, iii, Table I), which correlate with the northern Variant Biggar flat axes. These narrower variants are thought to represent an advanced or late feature of the Migdale tradition (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 46). A diagnostic metrical feature in favour of its late development within the Migdale series is its low blade width to blade length ratio of 0.41. Needham, in his study of the flat and low-flanged axes of southern Britain (Needham 1983; 2004, 220-2; Illus. 19.3) was able to show a chronological trend, seeing ratios decline from ranges of 0.50-0.60 in the earlier Migdale-Brithdir metalworking tradition (with its typical broad bladed and flaring Type Migdale axes) to 0.40-0.50 in the succeeding Mile Cross metalworking tradition. A ratio of 0.41 for this axe clearly sits within the range for late Migdale or Class 3F axes typical of the Mile Cross tradition of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1983, 147-52).





The second axe (No. 2 above) can be identified as one of the earliest forms of Developed Flat Axes, known as Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 60-1). Typical features are a median bevel, hammered face edges (low-flanges), slightly angled sides, decorated surfaces and a medium blade width, as identified and present on this example. In Needham's typological scheme for southern Britain, this axe is an example of a Class 4B low-flanged axe (Needham 1985, iii, Table I; Rohl & Needham 1998, 89-90). Although it is difficult to calculate, with precision, the blade width to blade length ratio for this axe, due to the differential damage to both blade and butt ends, an estimated range of 0.43-0.46 is consistent with the wider observed trend for flat and low-flanged axes of the Mile Cross metalworking tradition (Needham 2004, 220, Illus. 19.3).



These axes may both be identified as belonging to Metalwork Assemblage IV- the Aylesford or Mile Cross tradition - of the Early Bronze Age (2050-1850BC) (Needham 1985, iii, Table I; Needham 1996; Rohl & Needham 1998, 89-90). The Migdale - Brithdir tradition (Metalwork Assemblage III) in part overlaps with this, ranging from 2200BC to 1950BC. Given the association of a late Type Migdale, Variant Biggar flat-axe with a technologically more developed Type Aylesford low-flanged axe here, a date range of 2050-1900BC, within the period of overlap, may be determined for the burial of these two axes.



Further evidence in support of the burial of the axes together and at the same time may be derived by the association elsewhere of Type Migdale (Class 3E & 3F) with Type Aylesford (Class 4B) axes in hoards (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61; Needham 1983, 294-6). The Mile Cross hoard from Norfolk, giving its name to the Mile Cross metalworking tradition, contained a Class 3F low-flanged axe (equating with Type Migdale, Variants Biggar and Nairn) and a Class 4B low-flanged axe (equating with a Type Aylesford Developed flat-axe) (Needham 1983, 294-6; Cat. Nf 45/1 & 45/2, Figs. 24 & 103; Lawson & Needham 1985). Additional Class 3E & 3F axe associations with Class 4B axes are found in the Place Newton, and Sherburn Carr hoards, both in East Yorkshire (Brewster 1952-5, 450-2 & Fig. 3; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 46 & 61, Cats 209B, 316A & C, 317A, Pls. 17, 26 & 27; Needham 1983, 294-6, Fig. 101). In Wales, a relevant hoard association is the Newport, (Newport) hoard comprising two Developed flat-axes of Type Aylesford, identified by Needham as one Class 3F low-flanged axe and one Class 4B low-flanged axe (Britton 1963, 312, Appendix A, II.7; Needham 1979, 285-6, Fig. 12.1; 1983, 294-6, Fig. 101; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61; Gwilt 1999, 4; Northover unpublished, H. 122). These belong to the Mile Cross - Aylesford metalworking tradition dating to 2050-1850BC (Needham 1985, iii, Table I; Needham 1996).



Also from Wales is the Brithdir (Pont Caradoc), Caerphilly hoard, which contained three Type Migdale axes (Class 3E) and one Type Aylesford (Class 4A) axe (Britton 1963, 312, Appendix A. No. II.6; Needham 1979, 283, Fig. 10; Gwilt 1999; Northover unpublished, H. 70). The Brithdir hoard has been interpreted as typifying the Migdale metalworking tradition in southern Britain. The single wide-bladed axe with a median bevel (Class 4A) in this hoard (classified as a Developed flat-axe of Type Aylesford by other researchers), has been argued as earlier than true low-flanged axes with narrower blades (Class 4B) of the later Mile Cross tradition (Needham 2004, 222). Yet the three Type Migdale axes in this hoard have narrow butts and markedly flared and wide-bladed forms and these characteristics have been argued a more typical of the near-Migdale axes, which developed from the classic Migdale axes of northern Britain (Needham 2004, 220-1). Both this feature and the single axe with a median bevel, suggest that the Brithdir hoard typifies the late Migdale to early Mile Cross transition (Needham 1983, 290), dating to 2050-1950BC, rather than the classic Migdale tradition of northern Britain spanning from as early as 2200BC to 1950BC. It is possible that chronological changes in blade and butt widths observed on flat axes and the appearance of median bevels and low-flanges were piecemeal, with slightly different trajectories of change in different regions and hoard associations across Britain. Therefore, the Brithdir hoard may be seen as an appropriate broadly contemporary and transitional parallel to the Nevern hoard, containing late Migdale axes and an early Developed flat-axe in association.



Finally from Wales, mention should also be made the Oxwich hoard, discovered by a metal-detectorist in 1999, comprises three fragmentary bronze flat axes (Gwilt & Macdonald 1999; Northover unpublished report). One axe with a wide flaring blade and narrow butt is a development from Irish Killaha axes and Migdale axes, finding parallel with Type Migdale, Variant Nairn axes and equating to a Class 3B flat axe (Harbison 1969, 24-32, Cat. 580; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 48-9, Cat. 246; Needham 1985b; Rohl & Needham 1998, 88-9; Northover unpublished report). A second small side fragment is less diagnostic, but was once probably part of a similar axe (Northover unpublished report). The third fragment is a narrow and decorated butt: each side has a marked longitudinal ridge with faces decorated with three parallel bands of overlapping hammered dashes arranged vertically. Insufficient of this axe survives to confidently identify it to precise type. However, the earliest known decorated flat-axes belong to the Migdale-Brithdir metalworking tradition with decoration continuing and becoming increasingly frequent features of Developed and low-flanged axes, during the succeeding Mile Cross and Willerby metalworking traditions spanning 2050-1700BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 44-5, 59; Northover unpublished report). While the decoration on this axe butt has been paralleled with that observed on certain Irish Developed flat-axes of slightly later date (Harbison 1969, 32-55, Cats. 866, 914 & 915; Northover unpublished report), the metallurgical composition of this axe, with B1 impurity patterns, is consistent with those in the Brithdir and Newport hoards. Therefore, the Oxwich hoard was probably buried at a similar time as the Nevern hoard, between 2050-1900BC and during the late Migdale-Brithdir to Mile Cross-Aylesford metalworking traditions.



In a British and Irish context, some further contemporary metalwork associations may be cited. The Highlow and St Bertram's Well hoards, both from Derbyshire, each contained associations of Class 3F axes (Needham 1983, 152 & 195, Cats. Dy 8/1, Dy 8/2, Sd2 and UP30, Figs. 23, 24 & 103). The Read, Lancashire hoard has one surviving Class 3F axe found in association with a number of other flat axes, now lost (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 61, Cat. 317 & Pl. 27; Needham 1983, 152), while the Castle Rising, Norfolk hoard contained an association of a Class 3E/F axe with a Class 3E axe (Needham 1983, 252-3, Figs. 23, 87 & 102; Needham & Lawson 1985; Rohl & Needham 1998, 201 In Ireland, the Ballyvalley, Co. Down and Glenwhirry, Co. Antrim hoards each contained a Class 3F axe in association with a Class 3E axe (Harbison 1969, 37 & 45, Cats. 943-4, 1252-3, Pls. 42 & 55; Needham 1983, 152). The Caerlaverock, Dumfries hoard comprised a Class 3F axe in association with a Class 3G axe (Yates 1979; Needham 1983, 152 & 295). The St Erth, Cornwall hoard contained two Class 4B (Aylesford) axes in association (Needham 1983, 295, CW 9/1 & 9/2, Figs. 32, 33 & 102). A number of graves have contained important metalwork associations: the Moot Low Barrow, Derbyshire contained a Class 3F axe and a lower jaw of pig, associated with a crouched inhumation (Needham 1983, 295, Dy 12/1, Fig. 25). The Parwich Moor 1, Derbyshire inhumation burial contained a Class 4B axe associated with a Type Merthyr Mawr, Variant Parwich bronze dagger, a jet disc bead and a 'circular' flint (Gerloff 1975, 50-1, Cat. 54 & Pl.5; Needham 1983, 295, Dy 13/1-13/4, Figs. 30 & 104) and the Aylesford inhumation burial contained a Class 4B axe associated with two riveted daggers, one of Type Masterton and the other of Group Aylesford (Gerloff 1975, 61 & 68, Cats. 86 & 103, Pls. 8 &10; Needham 1983, 295, Kt 2/1-2/3, Figs. 29 & 102). These latter two burials help to cross-correlate the axe series with contemporary daggers and developments in the Early Bronze Age burial record, although precise dating of these daggers has nevertheless proved problematic (Needham 1983, 169-71).



Nine single finds of Type Migdale bronze flat-axes are known from west Wales. These include examples from Whitechurch, Llanfyrnach, Llanfyrnach Common and Whitesands Bay in Pembrokeshire (Griffiths 1893; Nash Williams 1927; 1929; Fox & Bowen 1935, 52 & Fig. 26.1; Evans 1937; Savory 1980, 100-101, Cats. 107, 114; Northover unpublished, Cat. Nos. 44-47), Llandybїe, Cenarth and Llanddarog in Carmarthenshire (Savory 1962; 1963a; 1980, 101, Cat. 112; Northover unpublished, Cat. Nos. 24-26) and Cefn Coch, Glandyfi in Ceredigion (Sansbury 1930; Briggs 1994, 215, Appendix V, No. 7, Fig. 29.1; Northover unpublished, Cat. 23) with another example said to have been found in west Wales, probably Pembrokeshire (Wheeler 1922, 188; Northover unpublished, Cat. 53). To these may be added a single bronze Type Killaha flat-axe from St. Edren's, Mathry, Pembrokeshire (Northover unpublished, Cat. 20), while single Developed flat-axes of Type Scrabo Hill and Type Glenalla are known from Llanglydwen in Carmarthenshire and Rhyd y Torth, Ceredigion respectively (Sansbury 1930; Savory 1951; 1980, 101, Cat. 115, Fig. 17; Briggs 1994, 216, Appendix V, No. 21, Fig. 29.5 & 29.6; Northover unpublished, Cats. 64 & 69). The apparent relative frequency of Type Migdale axes here in comparison with a relative sparcity of Developed flat-axes, is an interesting and distinctive emerging regional pattern (Williams & Lodwick forthcoming, 11). Across north Wales and south east Wales, later Developed flat-axes are far more frequent occurrences, both numerically and proportionately in comparison with Migdale flat axes (Williams & Lodwick forthcoming, Map 4).



Within this broader regional pattern, there seems also to be a significant local clustering in the distribution of early bronze axes in north western Carmarthenshire and north eastern Pembrokeshire, as indicated by the Whitechurch, Llanfyrnach and Llanfyrnach Common, Llanglydwen single axes, and now the Nevern hoard. Most of these axes date from 2100-1900BC, with the single exception of the Llanglydwen example, which dates from 1900-1700BC. These appear to circle the eastern and northern margins of Mynydd Preseli (Savory 1962, 75; Gwilt 1999, Fig. 2; Williams & Lodwick forthcoming 11-12) and in a land block of approximately 10km (north to south) by 13km (east to west). This was a sacred and symbolic landscape in the Neolithic and Bronze Age, with many tombs and ritual monuments known (e.g. Kirk & Williams 2000; Darvill et al 2003; 2005; 2006; Darvill & Wainwright 2002a; 2002b; 2003), while its outcropping bluestones (dolerites, rhyolites and tuffs) were transported and incorporated into the great ritual monument at Stonehenge in Wiltshire between 2550-1600BC (e.g. Cleal 1995; Montague 1995, 375-6; Darvill 2006, 136-41; Darvill & Wainwright 2009; Burrow 2011, 48-52; Ixer & Bevins 2011; Bevins et al 2011). In addition, Neolithic stone axes and Early Bronze Age axe-hammers and battle axes were created using a variety of outcropping rocks from northern and western Pembrokeshire, being transported and exchanged over long distances across southern Britain (e.g. Shotton1972; Cummins 1979; Roe 1966; 1979; Savory 1980, 36-8; Clough 1988; Houlder 1988; Burrow 2003, 63-5 & Fig. 28). It seems possible that the access to, use and deposition of early bronze axes in this regional locality is interlinked within this broader symbolic and exchange context.



The archaeological findspot investigation, undertaken with the assistance of the finders, enabled the details of the reported depths and an account of the relative positioning of the two axes to be clarified: the axes were buried at approximately 0.28m depth and approximately 2.7m apart, buried flat and with their blade ends both facing west. Unfortunately the detector pits marking the precise findspots of each axe could not be re-identified and therefore no further information about the precise burial contexts could be retrieved. However, the hand excavation of a test pit in the immediate vicinity of the finds, allowed the character of the soils and local weathered bedrock to be revealed. Given the close association and contemporary date of the two axes, it seems probable that they were originally buried together as a hoard. It is possible that they were buried a short distance apart in a large archaeological feature, such as a pit, scoop or ditch. However, equally likely is that the axes became slightly dispersed after burial, although their depth suggests this occurred in antiquity, rather than in the post-Medieval period due to agricultural activity. The local geology comprises three main elements: parallel linear outcrops of low grade metamorphosed mudstones of the Aber Mawr Formation (AbM), next to overlying tuffs of the Fishguard Volcanic Group (FV), with intruded dolerite outcrops (Richard Bevins pers. comm.). The angular laminating rock fragments identified in the soil layers may therefore be identified as weathered mudstone, while the large boulder and the sub-rounded igneous stones are intrusive dolerite. Locally, the frequently occurring surface boulders occurring in this landscape setting are also doleritic, having been re-worked locally by ice, frost action and glacial melt-water stream action. The hoard find is situated within a local landscape context which is rich in known prehistoric monuments, sites and finds (Page pers. comm.). The placing of the hoard at a watery origin, with views out over lower lying land and looking toward the sea, may have held particular social and symbolic associations to Early Bronze Age communities (e.g. Darvill et al 2004), making it an appropriate place for burying valued metal artefacts.

It is likely that this tool is from the Wilberton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking, phases which correspond to Needham's (1996) Period's 6 - 8.","Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC.

Stuart Needham, having examined a photograph, comments:


""It is interesting to learn of yet another of these arrowheads from British soil. Many years ago I would have ]...[ suspected a collector's loss. However, there are now sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard, Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have to be Early Bronze Age. Bronze barbed-and-tanged arrowheads in one guise or another continue right through and my suspicion would be that most finds are Middle to Late BA. The Penard example proved to have an unusual metal composition suggestive of it being a foreigner.""

The plain exterior and the size recalls that of socketed axes from Caythorpe 1 held in Lincoln Museum (Davey, P. 1970, Later Bronze Age Metalwork from Lincolnshire [volume 1], B. Phil. Dissertation for University of Liverpool, pages 81-85), for which parallels are cited (ibid. page 94) from Roxby, Haxey and West Halton, North Linconshire. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 700-600 BC.

574612,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,A large fragment of a Middle Bronze Age rapier blade in very fine condition. The blade was recovered from a riverine deposit. Peter Reavill comments: the classic tell-tale features are the thickened forte (the section by the hilt) that tapers into a very thick sturdy mid-rib - which extends to the point which is almost lozengiform in section. The blades are thought to be for stabbing rather than slashing. The cutting edges are present - but feathered. This blade is snapped below the diagnostic part which is the hilt plate (often trapezoidal) with 2 - 4 rivet holes. The junction between the hilt and upper blade is also lost. I think I would be happiest with attributing it to Burgess / Gerloff's Group III http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/109896- as it seems to have a 'triple arras' - central rib flanked by lesser rib near the cutting edge - possibly Group IV http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/57067 as the outer rib is more rounded and less distinct. Both of these date to the period 1400-1250BC - Needham's period 5. Rapiers are often associated with deposition within running water (streams / rivers) and also static water (bogs).,,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,59.81,,,5.46,172.5,1,Margaret Broomfield,Margaret Broomfield,South East,Buckinghamshire,Aylesbury Vale,Winslow,SP7626,GPS (from the finder),51.9273384,-0.89615656,SUR-A10290,,13-987.JPG,Bronze age: Rapier,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/margaretb/13-987.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/443475.jpg

576641,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete copper alloy (bronze) socketed axehead fragment, of Late Bronze Age dating (c. 950 BC to c. 750 BC)


Less than 50% of the axehead is present, consisting only of part of the body, blade and the remnants of the socket. It is missing the top part of the axehead and the loop.


It is sub rectangular in plan, with an expanded / flared convex, but abraded cutting edge. The socket is sub rectangular in section. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to the base of socket is 10.23 mm. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. No casting seams are visible. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is incomplete. The sides do not appear to be faceted and no ribs are present on either the front or back of the axehead fragment.


The axehead fragment measures 34.34 mm in length, 24.90 mm wide (at the blade edge), 18.69 mm wide (across the remnants of the socket), 7.02 mm thick (at the socket) and 1.39 mm thick (blade). The walls of the axehead are 2.1 mm thick. It weighs 15.2 g.


The axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface.


This socketed axehead fragment is on the small side for the majority of socketed axehead types, but the shape and style is too well made for any of the miniature axehead types that are found in the Wiltshire area (Robinson, 1995). It is more likely to be Late Bronze Age in dating than Late Iron Age to Early Roman. Due to the axe fragment having a slender look to it, it could be similar to the Medreth type axes, possibly a SE type or Medreth, consistent with a Ewart Park assemblage type, of Late Bronze Age dating (Needham Period 7).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,15.2,,,7.02,34.34,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Alrewas,,,,,WMID-6FEAE1,,WMID-6FEAE1.jpg,Late Bronze Age: Incomplete Socketed Axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-6FEAE1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/439585.jpg

578179,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-750,"A fragment of copper alloy which appears to be an incomplete section of a blade. It is possible that this fragment is a small part of a blade of Bronze Age date (c.2350-801BC). Weight is 14.3g, incomplete length is 29.65mm, width is 25.31mm and thickness is 4.76mm. The cross section was probably originally a flattish oval with the edges tapering out very thin, now mostly missing. The upper and lower surfaces do not seem to have had a higher point/ridged longitudinal centre despite the presence of corrosion product and some patches where the original surface seems to be missing.



Mr Peter Reavill agrees that one section is suggestive of a blade and that a likely date range would be Middle to Late Bronze Age (c.1500-750BC). The blade is likely to be a knife although a fragment of sickle is another consideration, however not enough of the blade survives to be sure. The absence of a prominent mid-rib is not unusual as most slight blades do not have these See PAS record HESH-199F11. Dating Bronze Age knives is difficult and almost impossible with so little surviving as with this example hence the broad date range above. The presence of another Bronze Age artefact fragment (PAS record number ESS-8FB2C3), found by the same finder, within 1km of this artefact's find spot and the context of the find spot helps support the Bronze Age date that has been given to this fragment.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-12-26T00:00:00Z,,,,14.3,,,4.76,29.65,1,Helen Fowler,Helen Fowler,Eastern,Cambridgeshire,Fenland,Whittlesey,TL3298,From finder,52.56382561,-0.05405059,CAM-583B44,,CAM-583B44.jpg,Unknown date : Incomplete Copper Alloy Blade,Cambridgeshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/hfowler/CAM-583B44.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/440743.jpg
578359,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).


The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.89 MM (thickness: 1.49 MM). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved. The long edges bear slight evidence that they have been raised to form flanges. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.73 MM). The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 36.41 MM. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. Minor traces of oblique slash marks has been noted on the flanged edges, under a microscope magnification. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead.


The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. There are a couple of patches of a brighter green colour on the surface. These areas should be monitored for further signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This is a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the axe should be stored in a sealed air tight, dry box such as a tupperware box lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.


It measures 84.19 MM in length, maximum width at the blade is 36.41 MM, width at the butt is 12.89 MM and it has a maximum thickness of 9.73 MM. It weighs 70.2 grams.


The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). 


These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

578366,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1140,-1020,"A Late Bronze Age sword of the Wilburton type (Burgess and Colquhoun, 1988, 40), dating between 1140-1020 BC (Needham et al. 1997). This sword is a flange-hilted sword, the blade and hilt being cast as one with flanges running along the edges of the hilt. The terminus is fan shaped and about half the width of the shoulder. There is a small, uneven, deposit of lead at the terminus end which may have been to aid balance. There is a slight bulge in the hilt, towards the shoulder, and a rounded slot in the centre of the hilt (33.95 mm long by 6.20 mm wide).The shoulder curves outwards to its widest with a ricasso notch below where the blade joins the hilt, resulting in a barbed effect on the shoulder. One of the notches is heavily worn making it almost invisible. There are two oval rivet holes on either side of the shoulder (10.52 mm and 7.80 mm in diameter). The bevelled blade is leaf shaped, being particularly lenticular towards the tip.



There is considerable green-blue oxidation product on one side of the blade, the side which was facing down when discovered. Amongst this oxidisation are 3-4 patches of reddish-brown oxidisation. The other side has some green-blue product but also a light brown patination across much of the surface. One would assume that the most heavily oxidised side had been in contact with water for a long period of time, therefore being found facing downwards may suggest it had been flipped whilst in the river. There are ""nicks"" along the blade edge probably caused by a similar weapon, which may be evidence of use either in battle or practice.



This type of sword has primarily been found in the Thames Valley area or the Fens (Jon Cotton, pers. comm.). Examples of fragments can be found on the PAS database: NMGW-7D0AC5, HAMP-352B13 and LVPL759

Description



Sword



1. (SF 23) An incomplete and highly fragmentary copper-alloy antennae sword pommel (cf. PAS find: SUSS-761CD0; see also Von Quillfeldt 1995: Taf. 75, no. 219 'Schwert mit gegossenem Spiralknauf' for a comparable example with integral, probably cast complete loops). The sword pommel survives in multiple fragments, with additional fragments of the grip also retained; the lower portions of the sword hilt that would adjoin the blade appear to be absent. The pommel form is sub-lentoid in plan, with slight losses at both narrowed ends; it is flat in profile. Extending upwards from the narrowed ends of this flat, sub-lentoid form are two antennae loops; these now survive in multiple fragments. Both of the loops complete a full circle, measuring c. 1.7mm in diameter across each loop, with both ends of each loop extending from the flattened sub-lentoid upper surface; this suggests that they were probably cast in the complete looped form, rather than hammered. The fragments which form the loops are broadly flat in section and very thin. From the narrowed ends of the flattened sub-lentoid surface the pommel body extends down to a narrowed sub-oval in plan grip. This grip is incomplete and fragmentary, with its highly fragmentary nature preventing an identification of its complete form or type. Visible within the aperture of this now damaged grip is a layer of a dark grey substance (c. 3mm thick), possibly of organic material, that might have been used as a fixative for the tang of the sword blade; also visible is a small circular perforation that extends through the flattened upper surface of the pommel (c. 6.4mm in diameter) that would have accommodated the tanged end of the sword blade. The antennae sword pommel and grip are in poor condition outside of their fragmentary state, with much of the body suffering from moderate corrosion resulting in a green-grey patina, with an area of blue corrosion on one side of the grip. N.B. Photographs of the pommel in-situ (taken by Yorkshire Archaeological Trust) show that it was attached to a larger (now fragmentary) portion of the sword grip.



Dimensions: Pommel dimensions: 59.4mm by 23.5mm; Hilt length: 23.1mm; Hilt aperture dimensions: 23.9mm by 15.4mm; Weight: 30.44g (Main fragment: 21.01g; left spiral fragments: 2.78g; right spiral fragments: 2.01g; additional fragments 4.64g) N.B the many other probable fragments of the sword hilt (non-joining) have not been included in the weight.



Spearheads



2. (SF 22) A copper-alloy spear of uncertain type in multiple fragments. The spear fragments form the upper portion of the spear, including the spear tip; the most substantial fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan, though all original edges that would show the extent of the blades are now missing. The socket is missing. The spear fragment has a circular to oval mid-rib, and the blade surface appears to be flat, although only some of the original surface remains. The remainder of the large spear fragment is in poor condition, and is light green in colour with white, sand like deposits in the corrosion product.



Dimensions: Length: 77.64mm; Width: (at middle) 19.7mm, (at tip) 7.9mm; Diameter of mid-rib; 8.75mm; Blade thickness (at widest point): 3.95mm; Weight (large fragment and moderate blade fragments): 23.21g. NB smaller undiagnostic fragments were not weighed.



3. (SF 4) A fragment of copper-alloy spear of uncertain type. The spear fragment is formed of the upper portion of the spear, though the tip has broken away and is now absent; the fragment is subsequently trapezoidal in plan. The mid-rib of the spear fragment is sub-circular, with a flat blade surface and a bevelled edge. The fragment is dark green in colour and in a good condition, with a slight hairline crack on one side at the bevelled edge. A series of small, worn depressions are also visible along the mid-rib; it is unclear whether these were a result of manufacture or use.



Dimensions: Length: 31.6mm; Width: (at widest) 32.1 mm, (at smallest) 25.7mm; Weight 9.73g.



Socketed axes: Yorkshire Type



4. (SF 13) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1502 (pl. 96), 1472 (pl. 94), 1419 (pl. 92) and 1398 (pl. 91), though SF 13 has longer vertical ribs). The socket mouth is rectangular in plan with an everted collar, and with a horizontal moulding below. A small circular indentation resulting from a casting error can be seen in the collar (diameter 3.3mm). From the moulding, three vertical diverging decorative ribs extend on both faces of the axe; the partial loss of one face has removed some of this detail. The side loop, also springing from the moulding, is complete with a 'D' shaped aperture. Below the moulding the body of the axe tapers slightly outwards to a fragmentary and chipped wedge-shaped cutting edge. The axe has a mid green colour overall, with areas of lighter green where the original surface has been lost.



Dimensions: Length: 78.5mm; Socket width: 38.9mm by 37.5mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 4.75mm-6.9mm; Blade width: 42.3mm; Loop: 17mm by 9.7mm, internal dimensions: 10.2mm by 4.3mm; Weight: 153g.



5. (SF 16) A near complete cast copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1403 (pl. 91), 1471-3 (pl. 94), though SF 16 has longer ribs). The socket mouth is square in plan with an everted collar of uneven thickness, and a horizontal moulding below. From this moulding three slightly divergent decorative ribs extend, with the two exterior ribs sitting at the transition between the face and the face edge. The axe retains a side loop with a 'D' shaped aperture; however extensive active corrosion has partially blocked this aperture. A small portion of the blade tip is missing, with the original cutting edge still present. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. This axe has a light to mid green patina beneath extensive soil coverage.



Dimensions: Length: 79.8mm; Socket width: 38.4mm by 37.4mm; Wall thickness: 5.4mm-5.7mm (4.55mm at loop side); Side loop length: 20mm; loop width: 11.2mm. Blade width: 44.5mm; Weight 177g.



6. (SF 2) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type in three fragments (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1419 (pl. 92) and 1512 (pl. 96). The body of the axe is largely complete with slight losses to the socket mouth; two additional small fragments complete this. The axe has an everted collar, now fragmentary and uneven, with a horizontal moulding below. Three decorative ribs extend from this moulding; these are parallel, with the two exterior ribs positioned inwards away from the side-face of the axe. On one side of the axe a complete loop springs from the moulding. The lower portion of the axe consists of an expanded, slightly flared blade; this is broadly complete with a slight hemispherical in plan loss in the centre of the cutting edge of the blade. Additional losses to the original surface on one face and one side of the axe are visible, with an emphasis at the blade portion of the axe; these exhibit a light green colour, whilst the remainder of the axe body has a mid-to dark green patina and fair condition. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade.



Dimensions: Length: 81.9mm; Socket dimensions: 37.1mm by 36.8mm; Loop dimensions: 17.7mm by 6.2mm, internal loop dimensions: 10.3mm by 5.1mm; Weight: 143.59g (No soil)



7. (SF 3) A copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1503 (pl. 96), 1526 (pl. 97), 1536 (pl. 98). The axe is incomplete in that it is missing the uppermost everted collar at the square in plan socket mouth. The horizontal moulding remains, and from this three parallel decorative ribs extend on both faces of the axe. A complete side loop also springs from the moulding; this appears to have been miscast due to its uneven dimensions and finish. The body of the axe continues to a complete wedge-shaped cutting edge; there is one slight loss to the original surface on one face. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. The axe is of a very fine condition and displays a mid-green shiny patina.



Dimensions: Length: 84.2mm; Socket width: 33.2mm by 33mm; Side loop dimensions: length 20.2mm, width 9.7mm, internal diameter 11.4mm by 6.2mm; Blade width: 43.5mm; Weight: 154g (No soil).



8. (SF 10 and SF 8) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1361 and 1367 (pl. 89) in two fragments; one socket mouth and body fragment (SF 10), and a lower body and blade fragment (SF 8). The first fragment is formed of a square in plan socket with an everted collar, below which a horizontal moulding is visible; a complete but uneven side loop springs from this moulding. On both faces of the upper axe fragment are three decorative ribs; these slightly diverge, with the two exterior ribs on both faces positioned at the exterior edge of the axe body. Casting seams are retained on both sides of this axe fragment, and across the side loop. The secondary fragment is rectangular at the socket and flares slightly to a near complete blade cutting edge; it is slightly rounded with just one slight chip at the side to face transition.



There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade.



In the centre of both fragments at the point at which they join is a pressure point resulting from external force; this pressure has resulted in the axe separating into the two fragments. The wall thickness at this point on both fragments is distinctly irregular, with the face that has suffered the compression significantly thinner than the opposite face of the axe; this may be indicative of the axe being heated prior to being forcefully split into two.



Both fragments are a mid-green grey in colour, although the face which has suffered compression has areas of light green corrosion suggestive of its close proximity to another corroded item in the ground.



Dimensions: Length: 90.3mm; Socket width: 38.7 by 39.3mm; Socket wall thickness: 6.1mm-7mm; Side loop dimensions: length 18mm, width 9.6mm, loop diameter 9.2mm by 5.4mm; Blade width 48.9mm ; Weight 190g (lower blade fragment has no soil).



9. (SF 18 and SF 8 associated) A small copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type in two fragments; one small fragment comprises part of the socket mouth and side face (SF 8 associated), whilst the larger fragment spans the whole length of the object, with a narrow portion of the socket mouth preserved through to the blade tip (SF 18). The socket mouth is rectangular in plan with both fragments preserving part of the everted collar and the horizontal moulding. A side loop (part of which is retained on each fragment) springs from this moulding, along with three divergent ribs on each face. Casting seams are retained on either side of the axe. The blade is slightly flared and the cutting egde of the blade is complete, with moderate soil covering the surface of the axe; it has a mid-green patina beneath this.



Dimensions: Length: 64mm; Socket wall thickness: 5.15mm; Blade width: 38.2mm. Weight: 58.08g (large fragment 53.35g, small fragment: 4.74g).



10. (SF 17) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of Yorkshire type. The fragment is 'L' shaped in plan, comprising a portion of one face and one side; the completed socket is likely to have been rectangular to square in section. The fragment retains a pronounced everted collar at the socket mouth with a horizontal moulding below; one single vertical cast decorative rib is visible on the face. Traces of a casting seam are also visible on the side. This fragment has a light green colour overall and moderate corrosion product.



Dimensions: Length: 39.5mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 5.8mm-8.5mm; Width 24.8mm; Weight 27.4g.



11. (SF 19) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain, but possible Yorkshire type. The fragment is formed of the upper portion of the axe at the socket mouth, with the lower blade portion now absent. It has a rectangular in plan socket with an everted collar, with a horizontal moulding beneath this. Casting seams are visible on either side of the axe and a complete side loop is also retained. One face of the axe has suffered considerable pressure to its exterior surface, resulting in a moderate depression where the axe wall has been forced inwards. The axe has a mid-green colour overall with moderate soil covering.



Dimensions: Length: 33.6mm; Socket width: 44.5mm by 35.9mm; Loop dimensions: 20.2mm by 8.9mm, internal loop dimensions: 11.2mm by 6.7mm; Weight: 47g.



Everthorpe type



12. (SF 7) A complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Everthorpe type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess, 1317 and 1320 (pl. 87). The socket mouth is square in plan, with an unevenly cast everted collar; below this a horizontal moulding is visible from which a complete side loop springs. From this moulding the body of the axe continues in a straight form, before flaring slightly to the blade; the cutting edge of the blade is complete aside from a few small removals resulting from corrosion. The body of the axe is plain with casting seams retained on both sides and across the side loop. It has a mid to dark green grey colour and is in good condition overall, with a slight soil covering.



Dimensions: Length: 92.9mm; Socket dimensions: 36.7mm by 35.8mm; Wall thickness: c. 5.7mm-6mm; Loop dimensions: length 18.9mm; width 9.7mm; Blade width: 45.7mm; Weight: 182g.



13. (SF 5) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Everthorpe type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess: 1320 (pl. 87). The axe is sub-circular (square with rounded corners) in plan at the mouth, with an everted collar and horizontal moulding below. From this a complete side loop springs. The body of the axe is narrowed before flaring slightly to the blade tip; the cutting edge of the blade is uneven and incomplete. One casting seam is retained, the other is visible where the original surface of the axe remains. The surface of the axe is uneven and much of the original surface has been lost through corrosion, resulting in a light green colour overall. Additional corrosion product is visible inside the socket within the retained soil; it is not certain whether this is the remains of a secondary object or if the corrosion material relates to SF 5.



Dimensions: Length: 85.3mm; Socket dimensions: 36.2mm by 33.4mm; Wall thickness: 4.8mm; Loop dimensions: length 18.4mm, width 8.4, internal aperture 11.3mm by 6mm; Weight: 145g.



14. (SF 14) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type. The socket mouth is square in plan (with rounded corners) with an everted collar; below this is a horizontal moulding. A moderate sub-triangular in plan removal can be seen at the socket (resulting from the extensive corrosion of the metal); this has also lead to further cracking down the face. The body of the socketed axe is plain and is fairly straight, though it flares out moderately to the cutting edge of the blade; this is nearly complete with a few slight losses. A single casting seam retained on either side; a pronounced seam is also visible at the loop. The side loop is complete with a 'D' shaped aperture, currently filled with soil. The axe retains further soil inside the socket, with additional soil on all external surfaces. It has a dark green patina beneath this soil covering.



Dimensions: Length: 91.6mm; Socket width: 36.2mm; Socket wall thickness: 5.3mm; Loop dimensions: length 19mm, width 10.5mm; Weight: 169g.



15. (SF 9) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type (cf Schmidt and Burgess 1307 (pl. 86). The socket is sub-rectangular in plan with an unevenly cast everted collar; a moderate section of this collar is missing on one face of the axe. A worn horizontal moulding is also visible beneath this collar, from which a complete side loop springs; this side loop is uneven from casting. The body of the axe is broadly straight beneath the moulding, expanding in width slightly towards the lower portion of the axe, before flaring substantially to the blade. The cutting edge of the blade is incomplete with losses at both the tip and on both side faces. There is evidence of use wear to the cutting edge of the blade. The body of the axe retains cast seams on both sides and across the side loop. It has a mid green colour and slightly mottled surface, with a number of small hairline cracks visible on both faces; these have resulted in small areas of loss of the original surface at the blade tip and on one side face.



The axe has been poorly cast, with a number of small apertures appearing as a result. These are visible beneath the socket collar, on the side face near the side loop and two further indentations can be seen on one face of the body. The diameters range from c.2.2mm-2.9mm.



Dimensions: Length: 91.5mm; Socket dimension: 37.4mm by 37.9mm (with fragment missing); Wall thickness: c. 3.8mm-6.3mm; Blade width: 48mm; Loop dimensions: length 19mm; width 10mm; internal diameter: 9.4 by 5.8mm; Weight: 133g (no soil).



16. (SF 1) An incomplete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable Everthorpe type (cf Schmidt and Burgess 1308 (pl.86). The socket is sub-rectangular in plan with a pronounced everted collar, below which a horizontal moulding is visible. From the moulding an incomplete side loop springs; the lower portion of the loop is now missing. The axe has broadly straight slides and a slight flare at the blade; the blade tip is incomplete, with a moderate loss to one side. The body of the axe retains cast seams on both sides, but is otherwise plain. The original surface of the axe has been partially lost through extensive corrosion, such that the axe now appears a light green colour with a mottled and unevenly textured surface.



Within the socket of this axe is a fragment of a secondary item, probably a socketed axe socket, still retained within moderate soil. This fragment has an everted collar and might have once been rounded in plan at the socket.



Dimensions: Length 82.9mm, length including internal fragment: 90.3mm; Socket dimensions: 38mm by 36.4mm; Loop dimensions: length 9.1mm, width 7.7mm; Weight: 195g.



Meldreth variant Aylsham type



17. (SF 15) A near complete copper-alloy socketed axe of Meldreth, variant Aylsham type (cf. Schmidt and Burgess 1233 (pl. 83). The socket mouth is circular to square in plan, with an everted collar, and a horizontal moulding at the transition from the socket to the body of the axe. The body of the axe is narrowed and faceted (8 very slight facets), and expands to a flared blade. The blade is now damaged so that the original cutting edge of the blade is missing; further triangular in plan losses are also visible to either side of the blade. This axe retains two prominent casting seams, one down each side, with a complete, though slightly off-cast side loop. It has a mid-green patina beneath the soil covering.



Dimensions: Length 89.6mm ; Socket dimensions: 32.5mm by 30.2mm; Socket wall thickness: c. 3.9mm-5.8mm; Loop dimensions: length 19.5mm; width 6.9mm, internal diameter 10.2mm by 4.7mm; Blade width: 43.7mm; Weight: 90g.



Alford type



18. (SF 11) An incomplete copper-alloy socketed axe of probable type Alford (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 188-89), although with some comparisons among type Dowris (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 198-9; cf. Eogan's Group 11 (2000, 86-7), although the slightly moulded collar suggests it is more likely to belong to the former. The socket mouth is sub-circular in plan; a complete loop springs from the collar on one side. Within the socket mouth two internal haft seams are visible, with one projecting from each interior face. The body of the axe extends with straight sides for a short length, before flaring significantly to the blade; the blade is now incomplete with much of the original extent missing. Casting seams are visible down both exterior side faces. The axe has a slightly moulded rim. The axe has a mid-green colour overall with moderate corrosion product on the exterior surfaces.



Dimensions: Length: 52.6mm; Socket dimensions: 29.9mm by 27.2mm; Loop dimensions: width 6.7mm, length: 15.3mm, internal aperture: 6.95mm by 3.4mm; Weight: 52.61g.



Unknown type



19. (SF 20) A copper-alloy socketed axe fragment of uncertain type, which has been reheated and compressed prior to deposition. This fragment is sub-lozengical in plan, and has a 'figure of 8' section resulting from the application of pressure which has forced the centre of each face inward. The fragment is irregular at both vertical ends (where the socket mouth and blade would have been) with one end of the fragment displaying an 'L' shaped removal. Visible at this removal is a fragment of a secondary copper-alloy object now situated within the first fragment; this secondary fragment has an everted collar and slight curvature to its profile, and is probably a fragment of a socketed tool or axe. The original form of the exterior axe is unclear due to its reworking, though a small aperture resulting from the initial casting of the object is visible to one side. The fragment has a dark green-grey colour overall with areas of blue corrosion product now visible on its surface.



Dimensions: Length (at longest point): 45.6mm; Width: 38.6mm-38.9mm; Thickness (of compressed mass): 12.9mm; Thickness (of walls): 3-3.4mm; Weight: 77.19g.



20. (SF 6) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain type, comprising the lower portion of the axe blade and blade tip. The fragment has a rectangular in plan socket and wedge-shaped cutting edge; this is incomplete and appears heavily rounded and worn at one side. It has a mid-green colour overall and fair patina, although some portions of the original surface at the upper edge have been lost as a result of corrosion.



Dimensions: Length: 46.1mm; Socket: 29.2mm by 16.2mm; Wall thickness: 1.9mm; Weight: 57g (no soil).



21. (SF 12) Two fragments of a small copper-alloy socketed axe of uncertain type; one small socket mouth fragment and a larger blade portion. The axe has a rectangular in plan socket with an everted collar, (visible on the small fragment) with a horizontal moulding below, (visible on the uppermost portion of the lower fragment, at the join to the small mouth fragment). An incomplete side loop is also retained, with a casting seam visible down the opposing side. The cutting edge is wedge-shaped and incomplete, with a slight loss to the original surface. Both fragments have a light green patina overall with several notable hairline cracks on the surface, and the socket contains moderate soil.



Dimensions: Length: 63.2mm; blade width: 32.2mm; Weight: 49.04g



22. (SF 21) A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axe of unknown type. The fragment forms the partial remains of one side or face of the axe, with slight curvature towards one edge representing the original corner of the socketed form. The fragment retains a moderate uneven collar and has a dark green colour overall.



Dimensions: Length: 32.8mm; Width: 37.9mm; Weight: 22.96g.



Associated but non-joining fragments



23 - 28. (SF 1 associated) A further six fragments were reported with SF 1 which do not appear to fit with this particular item but which are undoubtedly from the assemblage as a whole. 4 of the fragments appear to have come from the collar of one (or more) socketed axes, whilst the two other 2 fragments of thin walled, curved copper-alloy, might possibly belong with the sword hilt.



1) Expanded collar with cast seam. Dimensions: 15.8mm by 16.6mm; Weight: 1.57g.



2) Everted collar. Dimensions: 15.9mm by 8.25; Weight: 1.05g.



3) Everted and slightly curved collar. Dimensions: 20.5mm by 12.2mm; Weight: 2.12g.



4) Everted collar. Dimensions: 22.7mm by 10.4mm; Weight: 2.4g.



5) Curved possible sword hilt fragment. Dimensions: 16.9mm by 9.1mm; Weight: 1.68g.



6) Curved possible sword hilt fragment. Dimensions: 20.4mm by 16mm; Thickness: 1.7mm; Weight: 1.02g.



29. (SF 5 associated) Grouped with SF 5 from excavation is another fragment of a socketed axe. The fragment is 'L' shaped in plan and comprises the upper portion the axe, with a portion of the everted collar, face and side face with a near complete side loop. The fragment is dark green-grey in colour with areas of extensive light blue corrosion product. The slight remains of the face appear to indicate compression similar to SF 10, 8 and 19. This fragment does not fit with SF 5 but belongs with another, as yet unidentified axe.



Dimensions: 23.3mm by 17.6mm; collar thickness: 3.95; Weight: 15g.



30. (SF 7 associated) A secondary fragment of an everted collar from a square in plan socketed axe was associated with this find from excavation, but which is certainly from another, currently unidentified, axe. Dimensions: 21.7mm by 8.2mm; Weight: 1.83g.



31. (SF 9 associated) A further very small fragment, possibly from a handle was also found with this axe. It does not fit with SF 9 and thus belongs with another unidentified axe.



32. (SF 10 associated) Grouped with SF 10 from excavation is a small fragment, possibly an everted collar, of a socketed axe. Dimensions: 16.8mm by 16.5mm; Weight: 2.13g.



33. (SF 10 associated) Nine small copper-alloy fragments. All are thin and curved in plan, and are thus likely to belong to the fragmentary and incomplete sword hilt (SF 23). Dimensions: combined weight 3.52g.



Several additional fragments were recovered from the spoil during excavation. These have not been described or weighed but are almost certainly associated with the hoard, and thus ought to be considered potential treasure.



Not associated objects



34. (No SF) A fragment of a copper-alloy object of uncertain form, possibly a handle. The fragment is rectangular in plan with a slight curvature in section. One end shows signs of attachment with raised copper-alloy material on both surfaces and a slight recession to the top. The upper surface has two pronounced raised vertical ridges whilst the underside is plain (aside from two bulbous lumps at the attachment end). The fragment has a light green to red/brown colour.



This fragment is similar in appearance to vessel handles of Medieval date, and was recovered from an area outside of the closed Bronze Age hoard deposit. As it does not appear be of Bronze Age date or from the hoard this artefact should not be considered as an associated find and is therefore not treasure.



Dimensions: Length: 53.8mm; Width: 30.5mm; Thickness: 6.95mm (at ridge), 4.8mm (in recession); Weight: 59.27g.



35. A sub-lozengical fragment of black glazed Medieval to Modern sherd. The fabric is stoneware, and grey in colour, with glaze on both surfaces. Relief decoration is also visible on the exterior surface, with two raised circular forms and a series of cross-hatch detailing.



Dimensions: 21.5mm by 21.3mm; Weight: 2.18g.



36 - 38. Three small flints. These are white-grey in colour and do not appear to be worked. They are therefore not likely to be associated.



Discussion



The Cherry Burton hoard comprises of objects that are relatively common in Late Bronze Age British hoards of the Ewart Park phase (c.950-800 cal BC), which typically consist of complete and fragmentary swords, spearheads and socketed axeheads. The socketed axe types are well known from Northern England, with the type Yorkshire axes that make up the majority, very well represented in East Yorkshire, as the terminology would suggest (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223-39), furthermore, the probable type Alford axe (No. 18) is possibly related to the type Yorkshire group (Ibid., 188) The spearhead fragments are too fragmentary to type but Late Bronze Age spearheads are well known in the region (Davis 2012), including in hoards with socketed axeheads (e.g. the Bilton hoard, Yorkshire: ibid., pl. 151). In these respects the hoard is typical of the period and region. However, a number of points warrant additional comment.



The first point concerns the presence of an antennae sword pommel (No. 1) from a solid-hilted Late Bronze Age sword with Continental comparisons (Antennenschwerter: Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, 122-3). To date only eight other swords of this type have been recorded in Britain (Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, nos. 751-5; Needham 1987; PAS find: SUSS-761CD0; Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 327-8); of which only one example in a museum collection is complete (from the River Witham, Lincolnshire: Colquhoun & Burgess 1981, no. 751), the other complete example is the (lost) sword from the Isle of Skye, known only from antiquarian records and an illustration (Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 327-8, fig. 28.5). The remaining six swords are in a fragmentary condition. The Cherry Burton example is paralleled by four other cases in which the sword has been broken through the grip, but it does not otherwise appear to resemble closely any of the other antennae swords found in Britain. The fragmentary state of the Cherry Burton pommel also hinders detailed comparison with Continental forms.



The Cherry Burton pommel may not be the first discovery of this sword type from Yorkshire. The example from the British Museum collection (1858, 1116.1) listed by Colquhoun & Burgess (1981, no. 754) as coming from 'Provenance unknown' (but actually from either Yorkshire or the River Thames) lacks its antennae pommel. The British Museum's acquisitions register for 1858 details that this find was made in Yorkshire. This statement predates the posthumous publication of Kemble's Horae Ferales in 1863, in which he notes that the sword was already in the collection of British Museum but suggests it was found in the Thames (Kemble 1863, 162). The confusion could be due to the next entry in the British Museum register being a find that was from the bed of the Thames (the two entries are given one above the other). If the register had been misread then this could be the cause of the confusion, but the posthumous editing of Horae Ferales by usually diligent R.G. Latham and A.W. Franks suggest that this cannot be taken for granted and some doubt must remain. Nevertheless, the distribution of the known British antennae sword pommels is generally eastern and the Cherry Burton pommel corresponds to the pattern in this respect. This also corresponds with Cowie & O'Connor's suggestion that the British antennae pommel swords have Nordic rather than Central European connections.



In contrast to the elaborate spirals of the River Witham sword, the Cherry Burton 'spirals' are in fact solid loops.



Its simplicity is paralleled by the examples from Near Lewes, Sussex (SUSS-761CD0), Chertsey (Needham 1987, fig. 5.15, 1) and the find from Snettisham ('hoard IV') (Coombs 1974; Pendleton 199, no. 1677). This muted feature does occur on swords from the Continent, including a sword from Munich, Germany (e.g. Quillfeldt 1995: Taf. 75, no. 219), but seems to be a more recurrent trend among the - albeit small - number of known British examples (cf. O'Connor & Cowie's point regarding the lack of exact Continental parallels for the British antennae pommel swords: 2007, 328). The parallel with the Snettisham 'hoard IV' find is worth pursuing further: it was one of the fragments broken through the grip and was found in direct association with objects of Ewart Park date (including socketed axes) that had, as at Cherry Burton, been intentionally damaged and fragmented. Both the Snettisham and Cherry Burton hoards included an example of a socketed axe with another object blocking its socket. The Cherry Burton hoard therefore helps to strengthen the case for placing antennae pommel swords in the context of the Ewart Park complex (cf. Cowie & O'Connor 2007, 328).



A further notable feature of the Cherry Burton hoard is the purposeful damage to several axes (Nos. 8, 11, 16, 19 & 30 in the catalogue). The range of evidence compression, the possible application of heat and the presence of axe fragments blocking the socket of another axe. This prevalence of this type of treatment in Late Bronze Age hoards from across Europe has been discussed recently by Mörtz (forthcoming) and could be related to recycling or more ritualized decommissioning prior to deposition. The prevalence and character of this treatment deserves greater attention in future research and studies.

Thanks are due to Dr Brendan O'Connor for comments on an earlier draft of this report. However, all errors reside with the authors.","Due to their age and grouping of more than two items, this find qualifies as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage and so as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure (Designation) Order 2002. The ceramic and flint material, along with item number 34 (a possible Medieval handle), are not thought to be associated with the hoard and thus do not constitute potential Treasure.

581284,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-700,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) socketed axe of Late Bronze Age dating (950 to 700 BC).



The axe is sub-rectangular in shape with a flared convex cutting edge and the socket is sub square in cross section. The socket of the axe is sub square, with an irregular mouth. The socket is 44.8 mm deep. The top edge of the socket shows little evidence of casting jets that have been trimmed flush with the socket mouth. A raised band (9.6 mm deep) is present at the level of the top of the loop beyond to the mouth of the socketed axe. The loop is well preserved and relatively small and wide with a irregular lentoid shaped cross section. It measures 14.0 mm in length and 5.4 mm wide. It is positioned below the raised band.The horizontal cast moulding is present on both faces and the edges of the axe; however this is better preserved on one face. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade.The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion.



The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion. Here a lighter green area can be seen, predominately around the blade edge, socket and the edge of the loop. These areas of exposed metal should be monitored for signs of active corrosion (bright greeny powdery residue). To reduce the risk of this occurring, the axe head should be stored in an dry acid-free environment, such as a sealed tupperware box, with silica gel and acid free tissue paper.



The axe measures  65.7 mm in length, 25.5 mm wide (at the socket), 31.4 mm wide (at the cutting edge), is 24.4 mm thick (socket) and 3.7 mm thick (cutting edge). It weighs 70.5 grams. 



Two similar socketed axes have been published as no 28 (probably from East Anglia) and 31 (Oundle, Northamptonshire) in Watson (1993, 6). These are considered to be Late Bronze Age in dating (Needham Period 7, c. 950 BC to c. 700 BC).

The spearhead is largely, though not entirely complete. The entire head has been cast integral, with a conical socket retaining lozenge-shaped sideloops near the base of the socket.

583703,Razor,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-800,"Incomplete cast copper alloy razor or knife, semi-circular in plan, with part of the circular perforation remaining that was probably for a wooden shaft or handle. The perforation has since broken so that the full extent of the curved upper edge is not known, but the opposite straight side of the razor tapers to a sharp edge. Both sides of the blade are beveled, from about 10 mm in from the edge. Perhaps its asymmetrical shape is due to it having been modified from another tool or artefact in prehistory. Similar perforated triangular examples have been found at Phillack, Hayle in Cornwall (TRURI 1701.124) and in Northwest France. These have been traditionally associated with 'Hog's back' knives and are dated from the Late Bronze Age but they have more in common with the 'Racloir' types found in Northwest France; and the latest find from Trevalga, Tintagel of a mould for a triangular razor or 'racloir' has been dated from the Middle Bronze Age, during the Taunton phase of metalwork, c.1400-1300 cal BC (Jones A M and Quinnell, H forthcoming. 'Lines of archaeological investigation along the north Cornish coast').



A triangular perforated razor or knife is recorded in SOMDOR-FFE225 and dated from c.1020 - 800 BC (Ewart Park metalwork phase) and is identified as one of the Carp's Tongue Complex knives, similar to the more commonly known 'hog's back' variety of knife. These triangular shaped knives are strangely absent from finds in the Low Countries on the Continent, and are very rare in the rest of Central or Northern Europe, apart from the 'Racloir' type of triangular knife found in Northwest France.



Until recently, perforated racloirs have also been grouped in France with the Late Bronze Age Carp's tongue sword complex, Bronze final IIIb (Burgess 1968, 38, Fig.13, 11). However, at least two examples have recently been identified in the Rosnoën phase in France, of Bronze final I, similar to our Penard phase, which dates from c.1300-1100 BC.



A similar example of a semi-circular knife can be seen in KENT-A6C993, which is incomplete but has been identified as hog's back knife or razor and dated from c.1020-800 BC, and has been compared to similar knives found in the Boughton Malherbe Hoard (2011 T464 and KENT-15A293). ""KENT-A6C993 is in very good condition, apart from being broken, and it is indeed a hog's back knife. These tend to have an irregular five-sided outline and often some kind of ridge parallel to the long edge. CORN-28E916 could fit with the outline of a hog's back knife, but would have had to suffer differential erosion of a rather unlikely kind"" (Brendan O'Connor pers comm). O'Connor (1980, 179) includes the 'hogs-back' knives found in Britain amongst the Carp's Tongue hoards, and notes their similarity to the sub-rectangular or rectangular perforated knives found on the continent, particularly in Breton hoards. These knives are generally found across Southern-Eastern England, with a strong presence in Kent.



The closest parallel is illustrated in Piggott's paper on The Late Bronze Age Razors of the British Isles in PPS Vol.XII (1946) on page 138, Fig.8, No.45, which is classified as a Class II razor hybrid from Bishops Stortford in Essex (now in the British Museum).



Another hog's back knife with a perforation towards the upper angled edge is illustrated in Burgess (1968) on page 38, Fig.13, No.10, which is grouped with the Carp's Tongue Complex, dating from c.1000-800 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of razors or knives from Hayle, Cornwall and Charlcombe, Somerset on pages 423 & 507, Plates 16 & 111, Nos.127 & 621, which are referred to as Hog's back knives.","Report from X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy analysis by Kathryn Moore at Camborne School of Mines:

The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 35 mm. The length of the flat axe is only 90 mm so it is about half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now very pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axe on page 502, Plate 69, No.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, and a short but wider example of a broad Migdale type flat axe from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall, on page 418, Plate 12, No.98c, which both are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axe with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, Fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.



There are similar miniature Migdale type flat axes recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a 'Biggar' variant of the Migdale type of flat axe, but these have slightly crescentic blades.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

584168,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1300,"Incomplete cast copper alloy side-looped palstave, missing its blade, with just the flanged butt end remaining, which was used to haft the axe to its wooden handle. There is less of the left flange remaining than the right flange which retains the raised casting seam that has not been filed away, running longitudinally from the butt end to the broken edge. The left side is more corroded and has been marked with an incision, parallel to the remains of the casting seam, running the length of the side of the flange. The casting seams are also off-centre, which suggests that the two-part mould may have not been perfectly alligned. There is a slight recess, partly caused by damage, below the deep stop ridge which transverses the width of the axe between the high flanged sides. But there is not enough detail to determine any moulded marks in order to be sure of the type of palstave. There are two raised areas on one side of the palstave, however, which represent the remains of the base of the side loop. Much of the original surface of the palstave is also missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface that remains is quite pitted and has many recessed circular facets, which suggests that it has been in a suitably wet or corrosive environment to develop such areas of bronze disease. There is active light green powdering from bronze disease in one of the pits, but corrosion is generally stable. The side loops begin to be added to the sides of palstaves during the Taunton phase of metalwork, during the Middle Bronze Age, from about 1400 BC, and continue through the Penard phase, until about 1100 BC.

584231,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1150,410,"A Late Bronze Age to Roman (1150BC - AD410) copper alloy miniature socketed axehead: The axe is rectangular in plan with slightly concave parallel sides. The blade edge and blade tips are rounded, but not flared. The socket mouth has a rectangular internal edge, the exterior forms a asymmetrical rectangle with convex edges, particularly on narrow edge. In profile the axe an elongated triangle. Both profile faces are heavily abraded and no casting seam is visible. One profile face has the remains of a loop. The surface of the axe has an incomplete heavy brown patina, otherwise the surface has a mottled red/green matte patina where the surface is abraded. The axe measures 30.74mm long, 19.78mm wide, 12.02mm thick and weighs 14.2g. The interior of the mouth socket measures 11.86mm long and 7.13mm wide. The socket is 15.18mm deep.



The dating of miniature axeheads is from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period, although they are more common from the Roman period. Their function is probably as an amulet or votive. This example is more faithful to Late Bronze Age socketed axeheads than miniature axeheads usually are, and the heavy patina supports this. But Kiernan (Kiernan, P. 2009 Miniature Votive Offerings in the Roman North West Verlag p. 145-7) highlights the possible link between the 're-use of prehistoric axes in Roman period sanctuaries, and the dedication of miniature axes.' He lists Roman sanctuary sites which have produced prehistoric axes, some of which include miniautes axes as Richborough, Nettleton, Wycomb, and Silchester (ibid: 146).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-07-02T23:00:00Z,2013-10-01T23:00:00Z,,,14.2,,,12.02,30.74,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Stratford-on-Avon,Claverdon,SP2064,,52.27379194,-1.70830692,WAW-80FB93,,WAW-80FB93.jpg,"Bronze Age to Roman miniature socketed axe (plan, profile, plan and terminal).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-80FB93.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/444812.jpg

Modern damage central to the end of the butt can be identified by the lack of patina. The long side-edges of the axe are slightly flanged (being c.0.5mm thicker at the very edge than just inside it), with the stop ridge on the surface being just off centre to the widest section of the flanged sides, 48.2mm from the butt and 59.0mm from the blade. The stop ridge is 9mm thick, tapering to either end where it measures 2.45mm at the butt and 3.20mm at the blade. In plan, the blade flares outwards to form a crescent shape and is evenly curved but slightly asymmetrical. This axe is abraded and pitted overall, and has small patches of a dark green patina. This patina shows numerous vertical scratches and it is uncertain whether this is the result of the metal working procedure, or post depositional. There is no indication of any decoration.

The object is the tip of a weapon such as a rapier, sword or dirk. The blade tip has a central mid-rib and a worn lozengiform cross section with broadly parallel edges, suggesting a long slender-tipped object like a rapier sword. Although there is some damage to the point and the blade itself is slightly bent the edges and overall appearance remain in relatively good condition. Long bladed weapons are thought to be for stabbing rather than slashing (Peter Reavill pers.comm.).","

586758,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1850,-1750,"An incomplete cast copper alloy developed flat axe, of Early to Middle Bronze Age (1850 BC to 1750 BC) dating.



The axe is a narrow butted flat axe with a median bevel / proto stop ridge 61.2 mm from the butt end. It has tapering sides, which extend slightly above the front and back faces of the axe, a flat butt and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders. The cutting edge was crescentric in plan and measures 2.5 mm thick and 52.0 mm wide. The butt is 20.3 mm wide and 3.9 mm thick. The width at the median bevel / proto stop ridge is 30.4 mm and it is 14.9 mm thick. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself.



In total the axehead measures 118.3 mm in length, with a maximum width of 52.0 mm and a maximum thickness of 14.9 mm. It weighs 242.2 g.



The axehead is a dark green colour, with an even surface patina. The patina has flaked away from the surface in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green area. These areas should be monitored regularly for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occurring. This would be visible as a bright green powdery residue appearing on the surface of the flat axehead. To reduce this risk, the axehead should be stored in a sealed air tight dry box, such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal, lined with silica gel and acid free tissue.



The object can be classified as a developed flat axe most probably an undecorated type Bandon (corresponding to Type Derryniggin in Ireland). These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V), which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. The flat axe probably dates from c.1850-1750 BC.



Similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c. 1750 - 1600 BC.

588838,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete and corroded Middle Bronze Age cast copper-alloy Group I or III palstave (1500-1300 BC). A copper alloy palstave with shield shaped pattern below the stop ridge, and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with rounded blade tips, one tip in particular is heavily abraded. The surface of the blade has traces of hammer marks forming lines which cross the blade. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the nicks at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. On both faces of the palstave there is a prominent stop-ridge, one of which has a swallow hole (casting flaw) behind it, on the septum. This face also has an indistinct shield decoration below the stop-ridge on the blade face. The other side this shield decoration is not visible, and this may be due to the heavy abrasion and pitting. The flange sides are an asymmetrical lozenge in plan, and on the septrum faces the flange facets are higher on one face than the other. The septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, which is damaged due to another casting flaw. The surface has patches of a drk green/brown patina, otherwise it is heavily pitted, abraded and has some active corrosion occurring. The palstave measures 166.79mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 65.5mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 31.68mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 494.1g.



The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group I or III type which has a shield like decoration below the stop ridge. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes).","

590538,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-750,"A gold alloy 'finger shaped' ingot. The ingot is broadly rectangular in plan with a facetted oval / plano-convex shaped cross section. The ingot tapers in width from a bulbous terminal to a slender section which is broken; the break is recent, fresh and unabraded. The bulbous end has a slightly faceted section. There is no evidence of hammer marks or small striations, the surface is slightly pitted through corrosion and abrasion. The ingot is a yellow colour with a smooth surface.





Dimensions:

The ingot measures: 35.6mm length, 10.7mm maximum width, 7.9mm maximum thickness; and it weighs 22.8 grams





Metal content:

Analysis using surface XRF undertaken at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery / Birmingham Museums Trust shows the ingot is composed of

Gold (Au) 79.8%, Silver (Ag) 14.6%, Copper (Cu) 5.7%. The analysis of the ingot was undertaken on a clean and unabraded section of the break - giving analysis from the core of the ingot





Discussion:

Ingots of this size, shape and composition are notoriously difficult to date / identify to specific archaeological periods. The lack of hammer marks and other decorative features also make this task additionally problematic. The gold composition (above) does not preclude a Bronze Age date but it is unlikely to be of Early Bronze Age date. The copper content suggests it was added as an alloying ingredient and the gold/silver ratio could be natural alluvial gold. A similar planeo-convex ingot was discovered within a hoard of gold bracelets from Llanarmon-yn-ial, Denbighshire. (NGMW accession number: 82.93H/1-5/ Green 1982). As such it is possible to suggest that this example dates from the later Bronze Age c. 1500 - 750 BC)","I believe that both the precious metal content (gold and silver) of the ingot and the date of manufacture in the later Bronze Age fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act.

590761,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-800,"A fragment of an ingot or, perhaps more likely, an incomplete piece of goldwork from the production process. Half of the fragment has been hammered into a bar with a relatively regular square cross-section. The end appears to have been cut. The remainder of the fragment has not been as highly worked and is a relatively irregular sub-rectangular shape that tapers away to a thinner cross-section. It is not clear whether this end has been cut or whether it has broken.



The more highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a fragment with rectangular profile from Chalvington with Ripe in East Sussex (Treasure case: 2008 T425). The less highly worked end of the fragment can be compared with a number of probable prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) ingot fragments, including examples from Brabourne in Kent (Treasure case: 2005 T259), Trowse with Newton, Norfolk (Treasure case: 2002 T99), and the more substantial finger-shaped ingot from East Claydon, Buckinghamshire (2013 T850) and West Knoyle in Wiltshire (Treasure case: 2014 T686). It can, therefore, on the balance of probabilities, be considered to be of prehistoric (probably Bronze Age) date.



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis undertaken on the surface of the gold by the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research at the British Museum indicated a surface composition of approximately 91-92% gold, 6-7 % silver and approximately 2% copper. This is consistent with a Bronze Age date.

Peter Reavill comments that Double edged razors have a distribution which was ""Widespread across Britain and Ireland, particularly in the Midlands, Yorkshire, Wessex and the Thames area."" He goes on to cite The PAS Bronze Age Guide by Ben Roberts, that: ""The term double-edged razor covers three broad types of the same implement; those that were handled, [those] with a pierced tang, and [those] with a non-pierced tang. Representing the earliest form of copper-alloy razor, these varied in shape, starting initially with the handled examples which resembled spearheads (i.e. elongated triangular-edges, with one or two rivet holes at the base for affixing a handle. The tanged varieties were more leaf shaped, echoing the styles that came afterwards. The overall shape and size of these razors varied slightly across different regions of continental Europe, resulting in many different typologies and sub-categories.""
