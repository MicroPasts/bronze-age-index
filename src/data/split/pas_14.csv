857956,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of two spearheads and five socketed axes.



1. Plain Pegged spearhead, with lanceolate blade
Dimensions: surviving length 146.3mm; maximum surviving blade width 44.7mm; surviving blade length 115.7mm; maximum surviving external diameter of socket 26.5mm (side to side) by 26.2mm (top to bottom); maximum surviving internal diameter of socket 21.2mm (side to side) by 21.1mm (top to bottom); surviving depth of socket approx. 93.0mm; diameter of peg-holes approx. 5.8mm; surviving weight 142.6g.

Lanceolate shaped pegged spearhead with incomplete socket below peg-holes. The blade has a pronounced central rib, which tapers markedly at the lower blade, rather than tapering evenly along the blade. The socket is slightly sub-angular at top, base and sides, giving a socket cross-section which is not perfectly circular and has very slight angles. The blade has bevelled edges and at the widest point of the blade, the wing to bevel outline appears to have a slight change of angle, from a continuous convex curve, however there is no break in the slightly convex curve of the upper blade. The spearhead is of medium length, with blade wings of modest width, but marked thickness. The casting seam on the socket is visible but has been carefully filed or hammered down. The peg-holes appear to be near circular, although only part of their diameters survive, as the socket and mouth end has been broken away across the peg-holes. On the blade wings and bevels, striations parallel with the rib and blade edges are evident, suggesting sharpening and preparing for use. The spearhead appears slightly bent in side-section, suggesting impact during use or retrieval from the ground. The artefact has a grey-green patina, with pale powdery green, tip, edges and at the socket break. On the lower blade surfaces there are patches of green and blue concretions.



2. Plain Pegged spearhead fragment, with lanceolate blade 
Dimensions: surviving length 134.8mm; maximum surviving blade width 40.5mm; surviving blade length 134.8mm; surviving internal diameter of midrib aperture at base of blade 16.1mm (side to side) by 14.7mm (top to bottom); surviving depth of socket approx. 84.0mm; surviving weight 113.8g.

Lanceolate shaped pegged spearhead blade, with tip and socket missing. The blade has a pronounced central rib, which tapers suddenly at the lower blade, rather than tapering evenly along the blade. The mid-rib aperture at the base of the blade is slightly oval, widest from side to side. Traces of blade bevels can be seen towards the base of the blade, however most have not survived. The spearhead was once of long and narrow proportions, longer than the other spearhead. Marked linear striations can be observed at the base margins of the mid-rib, and there are also less marked striations on the blade wings, with an alignment parallel to the mid-rib and blade edges. The spearhead has a green patina, with areas on light green powdery surface along blade-edges and breaks. Both blade surfaces have areas of copper carbonate concretions adhering.



3. South Wales Variant type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 100.8mm; surviving blade width 39.5mm; width below loop 39.5mm; surviving external mouth dimensions 49.6 by 38.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 31.7 by 28.6mm; depth of socket approx. 82.0mm; surviving weight 191.8g.

A near complete slender axe, with one face heavily damaged and missing original surfaces and unstable and heavily eroded blade edge and mouth. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding, from which a narrow loop descends. Three parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, continuing down four-fifths of the remaining length of the blade, almost to the blade facet. The ribs are prominent but discontinuous, suggesting the mould pieces used to cast the axe were old. The face edges have also been raised, to give the effect of a five ribbed axe. The axe is rectangular in section, but slender, the sides of the axe parallel down to the damaged blade edge. The mouth is rectangular in shape and heavily eroded, making runner stubs difficult to discern, however one raised area, opposite the loop side, suggests a runner stub. The socket is misaligned with the exterior of the axe, with a small hole on one lower blade face indicating a differential thinning in wall thickness in places. The casting seams down both sides are prominent, but slightly blunted by hammering and the excess flashing within the loop was never trimmed, perhaps hinting that the axe may never have been used before being buried. Original surfaces have a green-brown patina, while eroded surfaces are light green, unstable and powdery. The axe is in poor state, showing laminating and cracking of original surfaces remaining. On the interior surface of the socket, there is an area of blue corrosion surface.



4. South Wales type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 92.6mm; surviving blade width 44.1mm; width below loop 37.1mm; external mouth dimensions 50.5 by 39.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 31.1 by 28.0mm; dimensions projecting runner stub (1) 9.7 by 5.4mm; height 1.0mm; dimensions runner scars (2) 8.6 by 4.1mm; (3) 6.7 by 4.1mm; depth of socket approx. 68.0mm; surviving weight 209.0g.

A near complete axe with broken loop with concave, diverging sides, flaring towards the blade end. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding from which the narrow loop descends. Three converging ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending down two thirds of the surviving blade. These are ill-defined, but continuous ribs, hinting that the mould pieces used to cast this axe were old. The axe is sub rectangular in section, though the upper face edges are sub-rounded. The casting seams down each side are prominent, having only received cursory hammering preparation, while the flash beneath the loop was never trimmed, suggesting the axe may never have been used before being buried. The heavy mouth is sub-oval in external plan, while the internal aperture is sub-rectangular. One runner stub and two runner scars are evident around the mouth, indicating a four-runner casting technology. Along the surviving blade facet on both sides, there are striations running parallel with the blade edge, suggesting some preparation of the blade took place. Across the mid to lower end of one face, a structural crack is evident, running parallel with mouth and blade edge and continuing as far as the mid-point casting seam. This appears to have been a failure in the casting process, relating to one half of the mould. A further crack descends from the mouth down the same face, but this may have been damage caused since burial. On the reverse side, there are two small surface pits, suggesting air bubbles trapped within the original casting. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina, while the blade edge, parts of the mouth, loop break and small areas of faces have powdery light-green eroded surfaces.



5. Ribbed socketed axe fragment 
Dimensions: surviving length 97.1mm; surviving blade width 48.2mm; width below loop 38.9mm; internal mouth dimensions at break approx. 32.6 by 27.3mm; depth of socket approx. 70.0mm; surviving weight 172.6g.

Large axe fragment missing mouth and loop. The sides are concave, flaring outwards slightly towards the blade end. The axe has a markedly rounded body, with an oval shaped cross-section and rounded face edges. Near the break, there is evidence of a flared mouth-moulding, but this is subtle and faint, rather than prominent. Three well-defined and near parallel ribs descend from the moulding down both faces of the blades, extending down three-quarters of the length of the surviving blade. Between these ribs there are feint and smooth ridges and grooves in the surfaces, aligned parallel with the ribs. These indicate probable shaping irregularities in the walls of the mould halves used to cast this axe. The casting seams down each side are visible, but have been hammered down and on one side, hammer facets can be observed along the surface. On one side, where original surface survives, striations can been seen on the blade facet running parallel with the blade edge, suggesting the blade was prepared. The original surfaces of the axe have a green-brown patina, while the upper face, upper break and blade edges have powdery light-green eroded surfaces. In the lower socket, there are green surface carbonate concretions on one side.



6. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - probable South Wales type 
Dimensions: surviving length 88.1mm; surviving blade width 43.8mm; width below loop 38.6mm; depth of socket approx. 70.0mm; surviving weight 130.7g.

Large fragment of a ribbed socketed axe, missing one side, mouth and loop. The axe has straight and slightly divergent sides, with slight expanding at the blade end. The axe has a blocky and rectangular shaped body in cross-section, and angled face edges, with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding. Three convergent ribs descend from the underside of the prominent mouth moulding on the surviving face, and extending down three quarters of the surviving length of the blade. On the opposite face, the ends of three ribs can be seen just below the break point. The casting seams are visible down both sides of the axe, through were hammered down, while a lower loop stub survives on one side. Slight denting to the blade surface, just below the break on one side hints at the possibility that this axe may have been broken through hammering prior to burial and the break edges here are non-eroded and soil covered. Large parts of the face have a black surface patina, possibly deliberately coloured and applied by the makers. The lower blade has a grey-green patina, while the blade edge and parts of the mouth have powdery light-green eroded surfaces. On the mouth, one small area of break shows exposed and fresh bronze, suggesting the mouth was clipped and accidentally broken by the finder during its retrieval.



7. South Wales type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 91.3mm; surviving blade width 40.3mm; width below loop 40.1mm; surviving external mouth dimensions 52.3 by (36.5)mm; surviving internal mouth dimensions 35.3 by (25.4mm); dimensions projecting runner stubs (1) 9.7 by 4.8mm; height 1.0mm; (2) 9.2 by 4.7mm; height 0.5mm; depth of socket approx. 56.0mm; surviving weight 227.9g.

Near complete socketed axe, missing part of mouth and original blade edge, with slightly divergent but straight sides and a rectangular shaped cross-section. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding, from which a narrow loop descends. Three near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. On one face, the ribs are short, extending less than half the length of the surviving blade, while on the other, the ribs are slightly placed at an angle to the side faces and are longer, descending down two-thirds of the surviving length of the blade. The ribs are not well-defined, suggested that the mould parts used to cast this axe were old. The heavy mouth has an oval-shaped exterior edge, while the interior aperture is sub-rectangular with rounded edges. Two runner stubs survive at 90 degrees to each other, indicating this axe was cast with a four-runner casting technology. The casting seams are prominent down both sides of the axe, but were briefly hammered down to remove sharp edges. On one side, there are angled striations on the lower blade surface, but these were probably created after burial, rather than being evidence for preparation of the axe for use. The original surfaces have a grey-green patina, while there are areas of powdery light-green surface around the mouth, along the blade edge and in eroded patches on one lower blade face.","The two bronze spearheads (Nos. 1 & 2, above) may be identified as of the Plain Pegged spearhead form with lanceolate blades. Plain Pegged spearheads, as an artefact class, generally span in date from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of similar Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800BC. The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, these spearheads are thought on stylistic grounds to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).

Three of the socketed axes reported may be identified as South Wales Type socketed axes or Variant forms (No. 3, 4 & 7, above), while another fragment is probably part of another South Wales type socketed axe (No. 6, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their Variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004).



One ribbed axe fragment (No. 5, above) is not entirely diagnostic to type, missing its mouth and loop. Its rounded body and oval-shaped cross-section, together with a gradually flaring mouth, without a step-change in slope, are features which suggest that this was not a South Wales Type socketed axe of classic form, although it is possible that this may have been from a South Wales Variant form. Alternatively, it is equally possible that this may once have been an example of a Class B - Southern English ribbed axe, of B3 form with three ribs and trumpet-mouthed (Needham 1990, 33 & 36, Fig. 4.23).

858124,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"An incomplete Bronze Age copper alloy socketed axe head, probably dating to c. 950-750 BC. The surviving section comprises of the cutting edge, now highly abraded, and blade, with the mouth, loop and collar all lost to an abraded, but patinated break. The axehead is broadly trapezoidal in plan, 82.3mm long and expanding from a 36.4mm wide at a worn break to 53.8mm wide at the cutting edge. The object is triangular in profile, tapering from 26.3mm thick at the break to 21.3mm at approximately the mid-point, before continuing to terminate in a point at the cutting edge. In cross section the axehead is rectangular, wit the internal socket being sub-rectangular in cross section. The walls of the axehead appear relatively thin, c. 3mm thick, although thickneing into the corners. The socket survives to a depth of 58.0mm.



The sides of the axehead expand in a gradual, shallow curve, and although now worn, the cutting edge seems unlikely to have flared significantly and is convex. The faces of the axehead are plain, with no indication of ribs or other decoration. Raised casting seams are present on both sides, which appear to be unfaceted. With the exception of the cutting edge, where it has flaked away, the surface of the object survives well, with a rich brown patina.



Overall dimensions: length 82.3; width 53.8mm; thickness 26.3mm; weight: 217.39g.



The tapering, rectangular cross section of the blade and its lack of decoration would suggest that the axehead dates to the Late Bronze Age, contemporary with South-eastern type axes (Pearce 1984: 34), whilst most likely of the Ewart Park phase (compare, for example CAM-3FFFA1 and WMID-B61E05 on this database), given the fragmentary nature fo the axehead a more precise classification is difficult.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2017-07-13T23:00:00Z,,,217.39,,,26.3,82.3,1,Wil Partridge,Wil Partridge,South West,Devon,Torridge,Broadwoodwidger,SX4089,GPS (from the finder),50.67860757,-4.26599355,DEV-7A77C7,,DEV7A77C7.JPG,Bronze age socketed axe fragment,Somerset County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEV7A77C7.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/623401.jpg
858133,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard comprising 12 complete and fragmentary socketed axes.



1. South Wales type socketed axe
Dimensions: length 109.5mm; surviving blade width 51.3mm; width below loop 43.0mm; external mouth dimensions 58.8 by 46.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 34.5 by 26.0mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 10.6 by 7.3mm; height 0.2mm; (2) 11.7 by 8.1mm; height 1.0mm; (3) 9.3 by 5.5mm; height 0.2mm; dimensions of runner scar (4) 8.6 by unknown; depth of socket approx. 75.0mm; surviving weight 439.5g.

This is a virtually complete, heavy and long socketed axe with a blocky rectangular shaped cross-section. The sides are slightly divergent and with slight concave curves and little expansion and recurving at the blade end. The axe has a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding, with a high and narrow loop descending from the underside. Three near parallel ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending approximately down two-thirds of the face. On one face, the ribs are discontinuous and less well defined, suggesting one of the mould pieces used for casting the axe was old. The face edges are sub-angular. The mouth is heavy and wide topped, with a sub-rectangular shaped external shape and a sub-rectangular internal aperture with rounded corners. Three filed runner stubs and a runner scar are evident around the mouth, each located 90 degrees apart, indicating the axe was cast using a four-runner technology. The casting seams down each side are prominent, but have been rapidly hammered to remove sharp edges. The two mould halves are very slightly misaligned, creating a slight offset between the two halves, and making the width below the loop slightly wider than originally planned. Towards the blade end on the non-loop side, there is an excess of projecting metal, indicating a slight casting flaw, which would not have impacted on the functioning of the axe as a tool. There are small circular pits on the surfaces of the axe, probably created as bubbles within the bronze as it was cast. There are linear striations running along the blade bevel, parallel with the blade edge, indicating the axe was sharpened for use. One blade-edge side has been damaged and removed, however the rest of the blade edge has survived reasonably well. Most original surfaces of the axe have survived and the axe has a brown patina. There are small areas of lighter green and eroded surfaces, around the mouth along the ribs, on one upper side, along the outer loop and along parts of the blade edge and break.



2. Croxton type socketed axe
Dimensions: length 108.8mm; blade width 46.5mm; width below loop 36.6mm; surviving external mouth dimensions (43.5mm) by (35.3mm); surviving internal mouth dimensions (32.7mm) by (26.6mm); depth of collar 14.2mm; depth of socket approx. 64.0mm; surviving weight 302.4g.

This is a near complete, slender socketed axe with approximately one third of the mouth missing. The sides have slightly concave curves, with slight widening and flaring at the blade end. The axe has a wide and flat onset collar, the collar slightly everted, but the mouth does not flare nor have a projecting or bulbous top. A narrow loop descends from the lower collar band. Three near parallel ribs descend from the underside of the collar, extending down approximately two thirds of the length of the faces. The face edges are sub-angular, however the faces and sides have marked convex curvature to them, giving an overall rounded effect to the axe, with its sub-oval cross-section. The mouth is narrow with oval shaped in both external shape and internal aperture and there is no evidence of runner stubs or scars. Casting seams are evident down both sides, but not prominent and there is suggestion that they have been rapidly hammered down. On one upper face and side, there are large rounded depressions in the surface crated by air bubbles during the casting process, however these are minor flaws and would not impact upon the use of the axe. On the blade facets, there are parallel striations running parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened in preparation for use. The break around the mouth and collar has a number of deep pits along it, suggesting that there may have been localised weakness here created by bubbling in the casting process. The original blade-edge is mostly present, with small nicks along its extent. The axe retains virtually all of its original surfaces and has a brown patina. On breaks and nicks, there are small areas of green and light green patina.



3. Croxton type socketed axe, with Yorkshire type affinities 
Dimensions: surviving length 79.0mm; surviving blade width 44.5mm; width below loop 33.7mm; external mouth dimensions 37.9 by 33.3mm; internal mouth dimensions 29.3 by 24.3mm; depth of collar 10.8mm; depth of socket approx. 65.0mm; surviving weight 203.4g.



This is a small and complete socketed axe with a rectangular-shaped cross-section, with straight and slightly divergent sides, expanding and recurving near the blade end. The axe has a wide and flat onset collar, the collar slightly everted, but the mouth does not flare nor have a projecting or bulbous top. A wide loop emerges from the underside of the collar. Three widely-spaced and slightly converging ribs descend from the collar, extending down approximately three-quarters of the length of the faces. The ribs are well-defined, the outer ones located close to the face edges, which are sub-angular. The upper origins of the ribs extend slightly into the lower collar. The casting seams are visible down each side but have been moderately worked down, either by file or hammer. The external mouth shape is sub-rectangular as is the internal aperture and the mouth is thin, with no evidence of runner stubs, or runner scars. On the upper blade bevels, there are linear striations running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating the axe was sharpened and prepared for use. There are areas of erosion and loss on one lower face, around the blade edge and in patches around the mouth and these areas have a green to light green patina. Overall, the original surfaces have a brown patina.



4. Plain socketed axe
Dimensions: length 78.0mm; surviving blade width 35.9mm; width below loop 28.8mm; external mouth dimensions 35.7 by 32.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 25.9 by 24.1mm; depth of socket approx. 63.0mm; surviving weight 107.3g.

This is a complete plain socketed axe of small size and slender proportions. The sides are slightly concave in shape, flaring outwards at the blade end. The mouth is flared, or slightly trumpet-shaped with slight bulbous thickening around the mouth. There is a wide and high-placed loop. The axe has a rectangular shaped body with sub-angular face edges. The mouth is sub-rectangular in both external shape and internal aperture and thin, with no evidence of runner-stubs or runner scars. The casting seams are visible and thin, but were carefully flattened either by filing or hammering. On the blade bevels, there are linear striations running parallel with the blade edge, indicating the axe was sharpened and prepared for use. Most original surfaces survive and have a brown patina, although small eroded green patches are visible around the mouth, on the loop, sides and along the eroded blade-edge.



5-6. Croxton type socketed axe & collar/upper face fragment 
Dimensions: length 133.9mm; surviving blade width 59.0mm; width below loop 44.8mm; surviving external mouth dimensions (46.1mm side to side); internal mouth dimensions (35.3mm side to side); depth of collar 18.8mm; depth of socket approx. 95.0mm; surviving weight main axe 382.4g; surviving combined weight of axe and fragment 391.5g.

Dimensions of small fragment: surviving length 37.1mm; surviving width approx. 26.5mm; surviving weight 9.1g.

This is a large socketed axe of slender proportions with approximately one-third of the mouth, collar and upper face missing. There is a small collar, upper face and side fragment, which probably broke off the main body of the axe during retrieval from the ground, but which conjoins and fits to the main axe. The axe has near straight but divergent sides, the loop side splaying and flaring differentially near the blade end, to give an unusual assymetric blade profile. The axe has a wide onset collar, with a slight concave curvature, to give a very slight flare of the mouth, but with no pronounced bulbous thickening around the mouth top. A low set loop descends from the underside of the collar. The sides of the axe are angled inwards from the central seams, rather than straight and the sub-angular face edges accentuate narrow faces and a concave flaring form. In cross-section, the axe is hexagonal in shape. The casting seams are visible, but were filed or hammered down. The mouth looks once to have been deep from front to back, to give a sub-square external shape and internal aperture, with rounded corners. The mouth top is thin with no evidence of runner-stubs or runner-scars. The blade is near straight, rather than curved. On the blade bevels there are linear striations running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating that the blade was sharpened for use. On the upper non-loop side, the axe has been damaged with a straight ended tool, which has removed an area of original surface and created a linear impact scar. At the margins, these damaged surfaces are light green, but near the impact mark, bronze metal has been exposed. A second dent and impact mark is evident on the broken face of the axe, which also removed two of the lower ribs. There are light green eroded patches on the blade sides, on one side and around the break edges. Cavities along the break edges and on one upper side suggest that air bubbles got into the axe as it was cast. Original surfaces have a brown patination, while one face has areas of a brown, compacted, soil/bronze concretion deposit still adhering to the surface.

The small collar, side and face fragment exhibits a wide onset collar of similar depth and profile to the main axe, with one upper rib and sub-angular face edge showing. The fragment has broken just beneath the mouth, so no original mouth top survives. This fragment has a brown patina over original surfaces, while the break edges are a green to light green colour. This fragment shows a reasonable fit with the main axe, indicating it is part of the same axe. On the main axe, newly exposed bronze metal can be seen where the fragment fits to the main body, providing evidence that the break occurred during recent retrieval of the axe, rather than in antiquity.



7. Probable South Wales type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 88.1mm; surviving blade width 44.8mm; width at point below loop 35.7mm; surviving external mouth dimensions - front to back 41.8mm; internal mouth dimensions - front to back 29.5mm; depth of socket approx. 63.0mm; surviving weight 182.9g.

This is a socketed axe of slender proportions, missing one-quarter of its mouth, loop and upper loop side. The sides are slightly divergent with slight expansion and recurving at the blade end. The axe has a prominent, somewhat bulbous and narrow mouth moulding with a poorly shaped but rounded mouth top. Descending from the mouth moulding on each face are three, near parallel, poorly aligned and executed ribs, which descend approximately three-quarters of the length of the axe faces. The axe has a rectangular cross-section and face edges are sub-angular but slightly rounded. The axe has a relatively deep front-back mouth, with sub-rectangular external shape and internal aperture with rounded corners. Around the mouth top, there are three rounded and poorly defined projections located at 90 degrees to each other. While the dimensions of these cannot be accurately measured, it indicates the existence of runner stubs, and suggests the axe was cast using a four-runner casting technology. The casting seams down each side are wide and visible, but have been hammered down after casting. The wall thickness in the area of the break is very thin, suggesting imperfections in the alignment of the moulds during casting, resulting in thinning and weaknesses here in the axe. This weakness appears to have led to a break here, whether in antiquity or the more recent past. On the surviving areas of blade bevels, linear striations can be seen running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating this axe was sharpened for use. On one face, recent linear scratches may be seen running between the ribs, suggesting recent damage, perhaps attempts to reveal the colour of the metal beneath. Original surfaces have a brown patination. The lower face surfaces are fragile and showing signs of lamination, revealing eroded sub-surfaces of brown and green colour. On one side, the mouth has been clipped probably during retrieval, revealing bronze metal and light green powdery surfaces. There are further light green powdery patches on the mouth, upper side and along the eroded blade edge.



8. South Wales Variant socketed axe 
Dimensions: combined surviving length 102.1mm; surviving blade width 51.1mm; width below loop 41.7mm; external mouth dimensions 49.0mm by (38.6mm); internal mouth dimensions - side to side 33.6mm (front to back not measurable); depth of mouth moulding/collar 11.8mm; depth of socket approx. 79.0mm; surviving weight 228.8g.

This is a ribbed socketed axe with a flaring blade, which is missing an area of one upper face and one-quarter of its mouth. The blade has also been broken across one corner. The axe has sides with concave curves, flaring outwards evenly towards the blade end. The axe has a deep and flat, but prominent everted mouth moulding / onset collar which is 11.8mm deep, and a relatively low set, but narrow loop, which emerges from the underside of this deep moulding or collar. Descending from the underside of this deep moulding, three near parallel and continuous ribs extend approximately two -thirds to three-quarters of the length of the faces. On one side, the ribs are slightly shorter, but parallel, while on the other, they are longer and curve to converge slightly towards the blade end. The flat-topped mouth has both sub-rectangular external shape and internal aperture and there is no evidence of runner-stubs or -scars around its top. The casting seams have been partially filed or hammered down. The break edges on the upper face of the axe show the wall to be very thin in this area, suggesting a casting flaw, leading to breakage here. As the break edges are fresh, the break appears to have happened recently during retrieval of the axe from the ground. On the blade bevels, linear striations can be seen running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened after casting for use. The break to the blade corner is soil covered, suggesting the break occurred some time ago, rather than during recent retrieval from the ground. The faces of the axe are pitted with small eroded depressions, suggesting differential erosion while in the ground. The original surfaces have a brown patination. The upper break and blade-edge have lighter green eroded surfaces.



9-11. Llanarth type / Southern English B4 ribbed socketed axe
Dimensions: combined surviving length approx. 105.9mm; surviving length of large fragment 88.8mm; surviving blade width 42.2mm; width below loop 31.6mm; depth of socket approx. 73.0mm; combined surviving weight 155.4g; surviving weight of large fragment 140.1g.



Dimensions of mouth and moulding fragment: surviving length 23.9mm; surviving width 30.7mm; depth of double moulding 15.0mm; surviving weight 12.3g.

Dimensions of small moulding fragment: surviving length 25.5mm; surviving width 16.2mm; surviving weight 3.0g.



These are three conjoining fragments of a narrow and slender axe, which is missing three-quarters of its mouth, moulding and its loop. The sides are slightly divergent and with concave curves, flaring slightly at the blade end. The axe has a flaring and trumpet-shaped mouth with a concave form, the mouth slightly thickened, but not prominently bulbous or protruding. There is a lower ribbed moulding, however this double mouth moulding does not stand proud of the upper blade, so does not form a clear collar. The partial mouth fragment looks to have been possibly sub-oval in shape, although this cannot be established with certainty from the fragment remaining. No runner stubs or scars are evident on the surviving mouth top. The axe has a rectangular cross-section with angular to sub-angular face edges, although the faces have a slight convex curve to them, giving a slightly rounded face appearance. The casting seams are visible, but have been hammered or filed down. The breaks on all fragments look fresh, including some areas of exposed bronze metal, suggesting the axe was broken when it was removed from the ground and suggesting that fragments of the mouth remain in the find-spot locality. The surviving original surfaces of the axe have a brown patination, while areas along the breaks, around the mouth, on one upper face and along the blade-edge have light green and powdery eroded surfaces.



12. Ribbed socketed axe - small mouth fragment
Dimensions: surviving length 19.0mm; surviving width 36.5mm; surviving weight 8.0g.

This is a small mouth and upper face and side fragment of a socketed axe, the surviving mouth representing approximately one-quarter of the original complete mouth. The axe has a prominent and bulbous narrow mouth moulding with a rounded mouth top. Descending from this moulding a single rib is visible running down the upper face of the axe. The external shape and internal aperture of the axe appears to be sub-rectangular, with rounded edges. No runner-stubs or runner-scars are visible along the surviving mouth top. The break edges are fresh, suggesting that this axe was broken during its recent retrieval from the ground. As this fragment cannot be joined to any other of the axes, this must represent a ninth socketed axe, further fragments of which probably remain at the find-spot locality. The original surfaces of the axe have a brown patination, while areas of the break edge and upper face have light-green eroded surfaces.



Other Finds



A Roman bell-shaped stud, a modern socket or cap fragment containing wood remains and a copper lump were all reported with the hoard, but stylistic properties, complimented by metallurgical analysis, means they cannot be deemed associated with the find.","One of the socketed axes reported may be identified as a South Wales Type socketed axe (Nos. 1, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). A second axe (No. 7, above) was probably also an example of a South Wales type axe or Variant form, exhibiting some of the typological features: a four-runner casting technology, three ribbed decoration on both faces, descending from an out-splayed mouth and with a sub-rectangular cross-section. However, as the loop is missing, the characteristics of its form and relative loop location cannot be identified. In addition, this axe has a particularly deep front-back mouth dimension, suggesting an original sub-square shape, rather than the typical rectangular form, normally with a long axis from side to side. This deep mouth may suggest an axe that was cast, used and buried towards the end of the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 850-800 BC), since axes with deep front-back mouth dimensions generally become typical attributes of axe types used during the later Llyn Fawr phase of the Earliest Iron Age.



A further axe (No. 8, above) may be regarded as a Variant form of the South Wales type. Although of blocky rectangular form, with three ribs descending from a prominent mouth moulding similar to the South Wales type, this was not cast using the typical four-runner casting technology. In addition, this axe has a deep and everted mouth or collar with an even and flat profile, rather than the more typical prominent and out-splayed form. The loop, of modest width, is also lower set than typical on South Wales type socketed axes, the upper arm extending from beneath the deep mouth or collar. Overall however, it is most similar in form and proportions to socketed axes of the South Wales type, hence its attribution as a Variant example.



South Wales type socketed axes and their Variant forms are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, around forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. Approaching fifty single finds of South Wales Type socketed axes have also been discovered in south-east Wales. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



Two socketed axes (Nos. 2 & 5-6) may be identified as of Croxton type, with their deep onset collar bands, with flat or near flat profiles and face ribs descending from the underside of the collar-band. The type name Croxton originates from an example found in Cheshire, whilst the form appears to occur most commonly along The Marches (Northover, unpublished, 267). These axes typically belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC).



A further small socketed axe (No. 3, above) may be tentatively identified as a third example of a Croxton type socketed axe, but also showing affinities with Yorkshire type socketed axes. This example has a deep onset collar band, with a flat profile and giving the axe an evenly everted mouth. The three ribs on each face are extremely wide-set and extend down approximately two-thirds of the faces of the axe, converging very slightly near ends. These, together with the blocky and short proportions of the axe and wide loop, echo typical features of Yorkshire type axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223). However, this axe does not have a prominent and bulbous mouth moulding with a second lower positive moulding, as typical features of Yorkshire type axes and there are no opposed ribs evident inside the socket (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223-39, Cats. 1356-1571 & Pls. 89-99).



The slender ribbed socketed axe (Nos. 9-11, above) with a flaring and trumpet-shaped mouth of concave form, with a lower ribbed moulding and three short ribs down each face may be identified as of Llanarth type, equating with Class B4 Southern English ribbed axes and broadly with Type Welby ribbed axes of Northern England (Burgess 1963; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3, Cats. 1335-55, Pls. 88-9; Needham 1990, 36-7, Cat. 52 & Fig. 6.52; Northover, unpublished, 267). Llanarth type axes typically date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC) (Burgess 1963, 22; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 222-3; Needham 1990, 38; Northover unpublished, 267).



The small mouth fragment (No. 12, above) once belonged to a ribbed socketed axe, whose precise type cannot be established from the small fragment surviving. However, various forms of ribbed axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in around a dozen known hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales. Therefore, this presence is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard association from this region.



The small, plain and slender socketed axe (No. 4, above) is difficult to identify to a widespread type, although the absence of any mouth moulding or collar precludes many recognised types. In combination, the slender form with flaring mouth, sub-rectangular section and deep mouth plan, with slightly concave divergent sides and modest blade expansion, are most closely paralleled with Class 5 plain socketed axes from Ireland (Eogan 2000, 42-5, Cats. 201-25 & Pls. 11-12) or the miscellaneous slender socketed axes with rectangular bodies provisionally grouped together within Scotland and northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 217-8, Cats. 1295-1303, Pl. 86). They have been found associated within hoards of Ewart Park / Dowris date (1000-800 BC) in Britain and Ireland, although an earlier origin within the preceding Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-950 BC) is suspected but remains unproven (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 218; Eogan 2000, 45).



Having identified all nine socketed axes from this immediate localised find-spot, it is apparent that they all date to the same period of time: the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The account of the discovery of the axes indicates that all nine axes were found within approximately 1m of each other at depths of between 20 and 50cm beneath the surface. This is consistent with their burial together at the same time as a hoard within a pit feature.

858484,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"~~Item 1

Late Bronze Age socketed axe dating to 1100to 800 BC. The interior of the socket has a sub-square shape with rounded corners and measures 29x34 at the aperture. There is a small projection in the centre of each of the sides on the top edge of the socket, these are the filed down remains of the runner's and risers from the casting process. The edge of the aperture is surrounded by a thick tapering collar that has a semi-circular loop that projecting from one side in a low arch to join onto the side of the axe. On both faces are three long and pronounced straight ribs with tapering terminals that emanate from the base of the collar. The sides of the axe are very slightly bevelled with a very low central ridge on which is situated the casting seam. The edges expand outwards very slightly to the curved blade on the forward edge, which has a heavily corroded forward edge.

Length 115mm, width 69mm, thickness 45mm, weight 368g



Item 2

Late Bronze Age socketed axe dating to 1100to 800 BC. The interior of the socket has a sub-square shape with rounded corners and measures 31x25 at the aperture. There is a small projection in the centre of each of the sides on the top edge of the socket, these are the filed down remains of the runner's and risers from the casting process. The edge of the aperture is surrounded by a thick tapering collar that has a semi-circular loop that projecting from one side in a low arch to join onto the side of the axe. On both faces are three long and pronounced straight ribs with tapering terminals that emanate from the base of the collar. The sides of the axe are flat with a pronounced ridge running down the centre which is the remains of the casting seam. Towards the tip the side curve outwards to the curved blade on the forward edge, which has a heavily corroded forward edge. Deep striations run across the whole of the blade and maybe evidence of sharpening.

Length 90mm, width 53mm, thickness 41mm, weight 228g



Item 3

A fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe that consists of the blade and the base of the socket. The break is ancient and irregular. The blade has a very low curved forward edge which is heavily corroded. Behind the blade the surface of the axe is in excellent condition with a dark green patina that has a series of shallow striation that run up from the blade on the top and bottom edge that are probably formed from use or sharpening. The casting seam is visible but has been filed down. The socket at the rear is oval 31mm long by 10mm wide and 9mm deep

Length 34mm, width 53mm, thickness 18mm, weight 87g



Item 4

A copper alloy socketed knife. The socket is oval in cross-section with an internal appetite of 18x10. The socket is sub-rectangular with slightly concave sides creating a narrowed waist. A single large rivet hole is situated towards the rear for attachment. The blade is 100mm long with slightly convex sides that narrow to a wide point at the tip. The face on both side of the blade is flat with long bevelled edges that form the cutting edge. The blade is snapped in two 1/3 up from the socket and although there is mud in the break, this section only show slight signs of corrosion with a bare metal evident over most of the exposed surface. Therefore, although this break is not recent it is still fairly modern meaning that this knife was complete when it was lost/buried and was broken post deposition.

858525,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of two socketed axes and one spearhead.



1. South Wales type socketed axe



Dimensions: length (including runner stub) 101.8mm; length (excluding runner stub (99.6mm); blade width 45.3mm; width below loop 39.4mm; external mouth dimensions 49.6 by 47.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 31.0 by 30.3mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 8.6 by 3.4mm; height 0.3mm; (2) 9.9 by 3.9mm; height 1.2mm; (3) 8.8 by 4.0mm; height 2.2mm; (4) 8.2 by 4.6mm; height 0.1mm; depth of socket approx. 72.0mm; weight 370.8g.



This is a complete socketed axe of slender proportions, however with a blocky rectangular, tending towards square, shaped cross-section. The sides are slightly divergent and near straight, but with a very slight concave curve and there is virtually no expansion at the blade end. The axe has a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding with a narrow loop descending from its underside. Three near parallel ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending a little over half way down each face. These ribs are prominent, but discontinuous towards the base on one face, suggesting imperfections in flow and casting, or a mould-half which was old when used. The axe has a near square body cross-section with extremely angular and crisp face-edges. The axe has a deep front-back mouth, almost square, and the mouth top is heavy and wide. The external shape and internal aperture of the mouth are virtually sub-square with rounded corners. Four projecting runner-stubs, two very prominent and untrimmed, are present around the mouth, each 90 degrees apart, indicating the use of a four-runner casting technology. The casting seams down each side are sharp and prominent and were never hammered or filed down after casting. The faces of the axe, have very slight and indistinct, rounded and shallow hollows across them and down to near the blade edge, indicating that this axe retained the contours of its mould and was never hammered or worked up for use. On one lower central face, there is a larger circular depression with rougher surfaces. This is not an impact scar and appears to be a minor casting flaw or imperfection in the mould. There are linear striations visible on the non-worked or hammered blade margins, running parallel with the blade edge. This suggests cursory preparation of the axe, which was never used as a tool before it was buried. The original surfaces of the axe have survived exceptionally well and have a brown patination. Small patches of eroded surface are evident on the sides, around the mouth and on the blade edge, and these have a grey-green patina.



2. Yorkshire type socketed axe



Dimensions: length 69.6mm; blade width 40.2mm; width below loop 27.8mm; external mouth dimensions 32.6 by 30.7mm; internal mouth dimensions 23.1 by 23.0mm; depth of socket approx. 53.0mm; weight 97.9g.



This is a small and complete socketed axe with a flared blade. The sides of the axe are divergent and with concave curved form, expanding more markedly near the blade edge. The axe has a double mouth moulding with a flared trumpet form and thickened mouth top. On each face, three wide-spaced, well-defined and short ribs descend from the lower mouth moulding. The ribs are slightly divergent and extend less than one third of the length of each face. A wide loop emerges from the lower mouth moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular cross section and the face edges are rounded, while the mouth is deep and square with rounded corners. On the inner mouth is a narrow line of projecting excess metal from the casting, though the edges are rounded, possibly rapidly hammered or filed down. Casting seams are narrow but prominent down each side, with little effort to hammer or file these down. In side view, it is apparent that one mould-half was deeper than the other, as the casting seam is off the centre line. One upper face has a shallow depression across its surface, suggesting a slight imperfection in the shaping of the mould. Along the blade bevels there are surface striations running parallel with the blade edge, while slightly higher up the blade faces are striations running at ninety degrees to the axis of the blade edge. These suggest the axe was prepared for use. Original surfaces are well preserved on this axe, with a brown patination. There are small patches and pits of eroded surface on the lower faces and along the blade edge, which have a green patina.



3. Plain Pegged Spearhead, with lanceolate leaf-shaped blade



Dimensions: surviving length 104.3mm; surviving length of blade approx. 87.0mm; surviving maximum blade width 44.6mm; external diameter of socket at break (side to side) 25.8mm; surviving length of socket below blade 14.8mm; distance peg-hole below blade approx. 11.5mm; surviving depth of socket approx.73.0mm; surviving weight 49.9g.



A Plain Pegged spearhead with a lanceolate leaf-shaped blade, broken across the socket near the line of the peg-hole. The midrib has a slight rounded ridge along its central length on both faces, giving its cross-section a sub-lozengic shape at the break. The midrib tapers slightly near the lower blade, giving slightly concave edges. The blade edges are eroded and no blade bevels can now be seen. The blade surfaces have many longitudinal striations parallel with the line of the midrib, suggesting the blade was prepared and sharpened in prehistory. Three-quarters of the break edges on the socket are soil covered, suggesting a break in antiquity, however there is also a fresh break on one side where the wall is thinnest, indicating a recent break during retrieval of the artefact from the ground. On each side at the break, the upper sides of the peg-holes are visible, suggesting they once had a diameter of 4-5mm. In side view, the blade is slightly bent, hinting that the spear may either have been damaged in use or forcibly bent and perhaps broken, before burial. On one upper midrib face, there is a corroded hole through the wall into the socket interior, where the midrib wall was particularly thin. Original surfaces have a brown patina. The tip, blade edges and part of the socket break have green corroded surfaces, as does the corroded hole in the upper midrib wall.","One of the two socketed axes reported may be identified as a South Wales type socketed axe (No. 1, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and narrow loop, blocky rectangular form, four-runner casting technology, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). This axe has a particularly deep front-back mouth dimension, tending towards a sub-square shape, rather than typical rectangular form, normally with a long-axis from side to side. This deep mouth and long slender form may suggest an axe that was cast, used and buried towards the end of the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 850-800 BC), since axes with deep front-back mouth dimensions generally become typical attributes of axe types used during the late Ewart Park and Llyn Fawr phases of the Late Bronze and Earliest Iron Ages.



South Wales type socketed axes are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, around forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. Approaching fifty single finds of South Wales Type socketed axes have also been discovered in south-east Wales. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



The second socketed axe (No. 2, above) in this hoard group may be identified as of probable Yorkshire type. This axe has widely spaced, short and divergent ribs descending from a mouth moulding, with a prominent and everted collar. In addition a wide loop emerges from the lower mouth moulding. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section and the mouth and socket plan is deep and square. All of these features are diagnostic of the Yorkshire type (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223). This is a small and slender example of the type, with a flared blade, however can be paralleled within the range of known examples of the type (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 224, 227, 229-30, 234-5; Cats. 1368, 1404, 1438, 1448, 1517, 1543, Pls. 89, 91, 93, 97 & 98).



Yorkshire type axes are most commonly found in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, though there is a scatter known in East Anglia and Scotland (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223). These axes are found in hoards dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, most commonly in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire East Anglia and Borders, but with occasional examples also known in Carp's Tongue hoards across southern England of Ewart Park date (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 237-8). One possible Yorkshire type axe has been identified within the Stogursey, Somerset hoard (McNeil 1973, 49 & 56, Cat. 17 & Fig. 3; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 238), while one socketed axe in the second Llantilio Crossenny hoard in the same field shows affinities with the Yorkshire type (Gwilt et al 2016a).



The spearhead (No. 3, above) may be identified as a Plain Pegged Spearhead with a lanceolate, leaf-shaped blade. Pegged spearheads, as an artefact class, generally span from the second half of the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard (Swansea), Guilsfield (Powys) and Princetown (Blaenau Gwent) hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150 BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920 BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800 BC. The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age dating to between 1000 BC and 800 BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3; Needham et al 1997, 93-8).



Having identified the three artefacts discovered at this localised find-spot and in close association, it is apparent that they all typically date to the same period of time: the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The account of the discovery of the axes indicates that these artefacts were all discovered in the same metal-detector pit, but at varying depths of 15-17cm, 30cm and 45cm beneath the surface. This account of discovery is consistent with the burial of these artefacts at the same time and within the same pit feature dug into the sub-soil layer during the Late Bronze Age.

858576,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-800,"Description: Incomplete gold strip of uncertain date (see discussion). Broadly rectangular with one complete end which exhibits a circular perforation. The strip is bent at a sharp angle and has a number of dents, terminating in a jagged break.

Discussion: The strip was found in an unstratified context during metal detecting. It has no decorative or other diagnostic features, and thus it is difficult to assign a date. Gold strips with perforations at one or both ends first appear in the Bronze Age (e.g. BH-1BE953 / 2014 T901, DOR-173265 / 2006 T380, CORN-8EC344 / 2014 T39). Although some others (e.g. NCL-59F7F8) have been considered undiagnostic and not provably over 300 years old, the balance of probabilities suggests that this example may well be of Bronze Age date.

Description: The fragment represents part of the socketed end of the axe and is unevenly shaped. Part of the rimmed collar for the socket remains. Just after the rim there is a side loop to help secure the axe to its handle. There is substantial casting line running from the rim and along the mid-line of the loop onto the body of the axe. It appears this casting feature has had very limited finishing. The fragment is dark green on the surfaces and a light green on the breaks which may suggest the axe was broken while in the ground but a substantial time after its deposition.

859258,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard comprising five socketed axes and one axe fragment.



1. South Wales type socketed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 101.5mm; surviving blade width 51.1mm; width below loop 42.9mm; external mouth dimensions 51.0 by 41.9mm; internal mouth dimensions 33.0 by 27.1mm; dimensions of runner stubs 8.6 by 4.5mm; height 1.0mm; (2) 8.2 by 4.9mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 7.5 by 3.7mm; height 0.5mm; (4) 9.0 by 3.5mm; height 0.2mm; depth of socket approx. 83.0mm; surviving weight 278.7g.



A near complete socketed axe with a broken loop, of blocky rectangular form, with straight and slightly divergent sides and little expansion and recurving visible towards the blade end. The axe has a prominent but narrow mouth moulding, with a high and narrow loop descending from the underside. Three well-defined and parallel ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending down approximately three-quarters of the blade. The axe is rectangular in section with angular face edges. The casting seams are visible down each side, but have been hammered or filed down with reasonable care, although the flash within the loop is slightly more prominent and less worked down. The mouth is sub-rectangular in shape and internal aperture. Four runner stubs are evident around the mouth, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The axe has a brown patina and most original surfaces survive. The blade edge is highly damaged, revealing lighter green surfaces. There are small areas of eroded lighter green surfaces along the face edges and around the mouth.



2. South Wales type socketed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 101.1mm; surviving blade width 55.4mm; width below loop 40.9mm; external mouth dimensions 51.2mm by 40.6mm; internal mouth dimensions 34.3mm by 28.6mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 11.3 by 5.4mm; height 1.5mm; (2) 11.4 by 5.0mm; height 1.0mm; (3) 10.7 by 4.6mm; height 0.5mm; (4) 10.6 by 4.4mm; height 0.5mm; depth of socket approx. 76.0mm; surviving weight 274.7g.

This is a complete socketed axe with slightly concave and divergent sides, with significant expansion and recurving at the blade end. The axe has a prominent and slightly bulbous mouth moulding, with a high placed and relatively wide loop descending from its underside. Three well-defined and convergent ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending down approximately two-thirds of the length of the faces. On one face, the outer rib, furthest from the loop side is more markedly angled and convergent, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of this mould piece. The axe is rectangular in cross-section with angled face edges. The casting seams down each side are prominent, but have been hammered to remove sharp edges. The mouth is sub-oval in external shape, with a sub-rectangular shaped internal aperture, with rounded corners. Four runner stubs are evident around the mouth, indicating a four-runner casting technology. One upper face has a shallow depressed area, suggesting an irregularity in the shaping of the mould-piece used for casting the axe. Along the blade bevel, the presence of linear surface striations parallel with the axis of the blade indicate that the blade of the axes was prepared and sharpened. The axe has a grey-green patina over most surfaces. On the upper faces, there are patches of black patination, suggesting that the axe may have been deliberately coloured through a patination process, after casting. The blade edge is heavily worn, with light green and fragile powdery surfaces.
3. South Wales Variant type socketed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 115.7mm; surviving blade width 55.3mm; width below loop 45.8mm; surviving external mouth dimensions (45.4mm) by 48.1mm; surviving internal mouth dimensions (37.3mm) by 32.7mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 7.6 by 3.3mm; height approx. 0.2mm; (2) 7.5 by 3.7mm; height approx. 0.2mm; depth of socket approx. 73.0mm.; surviving weight 376.7g.

This is a near complete socketed axe with a damaged mouth. This is a large socketed axe with an angular hexagonal cross-section, with slightly divergent and concave shaped sides. The axe has a prominent but narrow mouth moulding, with a high placed and narrow loop descending from its underside. Three very prominent and wide ribs descend from the moulding on each face and are convergent. Unusually, the central rib is significantly longer than the two lateral ribs, the former extending down three-quarters of the length of the face and the latter only extending half the length of the blade. The face edges are angled and significantly narrower than the sides and the edges have been deliberately raised, giving the overall effect similar to a faceted axe. The axe has a deep front back mouth axis, the mouth being square in external outline and with a sub-rectangular internal aperture, with curved edges. One half of the mouth top has been broken, the break looking fresh in places, suggesting breakage during removal from the ground. Two runner-stubs are visible around the mouth, located at 180 degrees to each other, but there is insufficient of the mouth surviving to tell whether or not there were originally four runners. The sides of the axe are significantly angled, coming to their widest point at the central casting seam. While the join is prominent and angled, there is little excess and it appears that the flashes may have been hammered flat in places. There are linear striations along the blade facets and parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened for use. Most of the original surfaces have survived and the axe has a grey-green patina. The mouth edges and blade edge are eroded, with light green and fragile powdery surfaces. There are also small patches of eroded lighter green surface on the faces and external loop edge. The casting seams down the sides of the axe are visible, but were hammered or filed down carefully after casting.
4. Class B - Southern English ribbed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 72.1mm; surviving blade width 39.3mm; width below loop 30.6mm; external mouth dimensions 34.0mm by 32.9mm; internal mouth dimensions 26.4 by 25.2mm; depth of socket approx. 61.0mm; surviving weight 101.7g.

This is a complete small ribbed axe, with divergent and concave shaped sides, expanding towards the blade end. The axe has a flared trumpet shaped mouth, but with no evidence of a collar or collar-moulding. Five parallel ribs descend from the under-side of the flaring mouth, extending for a little under half of the total length of the axe face. The two outer ribs define the face edges of the axe. The axe has a rectangular shaped cross-section and the face edges are sub-angular. The loop is low-set, its upper arm descending some distance below the upper origin of the face ribs. The axe has a deep front back mouth axis, being sub-square in both external shape and internal aperture, with curved edges. No runner-stubs or scars are evident around the mouth. On one blade bevel, the remains of striations running parallel with the blade edge are visible, indicating that the axe was sharpened as preparation for use. One face of the axe has been heavily brushed, probably by the finder after discovery of the axe, as indicated by deep striations and the loss of original surfaces on one face. On the reverse and better preserved face, and on the loop side, patches of black patina are evident, suggesting the axe was deliberately coloured black after casting. The axe has an overall light green patina with fragile and powdery surfaces. The blade edge is heavily eroded and fragile, while the top of the mouth is also lighter green and powdery.
5. Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth / Class D
Dimensions: surviving length 117.2mm; surviving blade width 43.1mm; width below loop 27.1mm; surviving external mouth dimensions 27.1mm (front to back); surviving internal mouth dimensions 23.2mm (front to back); max. collar width 28.5mm; depth of socket approx. 85.0mm.; surviving weight 148.0g.

This is a near complete, slender and faceted axe, with damaged mouth, missing loop and broken blade edge. The sides are divergent and with a concave curve, widening at the blade end. The axe has a flared or trumpet-shaped mouth, with a wide collar and a low-set and narrow loop, emerging below the collar. The collar is unusually wide with a convex, evenly curved and wide mid zone moulding defined to either side by evenly curved depressions running parallel with the central moulding. The collar is onset, with a step down to the top of the blade faces, but with a raised, flat-topped and wide moulding (2.5mm) defining the lower collar margin. The facets are narrow and the edges are sub-angular, the axe having a total of eight facets (three on each face and one on each side). The side casting seams are visible, however were hammered or filed, except beneath the loop, where a projecting flash is still visible. Approximately half of the mouth of the axe is missing and the break appears eroded, rather than new. The external outline and internal aperture of the mouth are oval in shape. Running down the upper face on one side, linear striations are evident, running parallel with the long axis of the axe. These appear to have been created in antiquity, since they are within the patinated surface. On the upper blade bevel, there are linear striations running parallel with the original blade edge, indicating the axe blade was sharpened ready for use. Most original surfaces of the axe survive and the artefact has a grey-green patina. The blade edge has mostly been removed through breakage. On one corner, the break looks new, exposing core metal, while much of the length of the broken blade has light green and powdery surfaces. One area of lower blade and side is also eroded with similar light green and powdery surfaces, while the loop breaks and parts of the mouth and mouth breaks are also light green and powdery. Within the socket, there are two projecting lumps of green carbonate concretion, about one third of the way down the inner socket wall.
6. Mouth fragment of slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth / Class D
Dimensions: maximum surviving length 41.6mm; collar width 11.0mm; surviving weight 15.9g.

This is a small mouth side fragment of a slender faceted axe, with two broken loop stubs evident. The axe had a modestly flaring mouth, with a medium depth onset collar. It is not clear whether the lower collar margin had a projecting collar moulding, or whether the collar was a simple band, with a concave profile and a step margin onto the upper faces. The narrow loop projected from the underside of the collar. Down the side, a casting seam is visible and appears not to have been trimmed or hammered across the collar. On one side, a narrow facet can be seen extending from the collar down the upper face of the axe and it is likely that this axe once had eight facets (three on each face, with one on each side). On the exterior surface, there are patches of black patination on the collar and within the loop and the interior socket surface is markedly blackened. The rest of the exterior surface has a grey-green patina, with small arear of light green and powdery surface visible on the loop stubs, on the mouth top and in places along the breaks.","Three of the socketed axes reported may be identified as South Wales Type socketed axes or Variant forms (Nos. 1-3, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their Variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, around forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. Approaching fifty single finds of South Wales Type socketed axes have also been discovered in south-east Wales. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).

One axe (No. 4, above), may be identified as a Class B - Southern English ribbed axe of a sub-type most resembling Class B2, with five-ribs and a trumpet-shaped mouth (Needham 1990, 32-5 & Fig. 5). These broadly equate with Type Welby ribbed axes of Northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3, Cats. 1335-55, Pls. 88-9). The apparent absence of a collar or positive moulding on this axe is a variation on the more typical traits of the type and this example is at the smallest end of the known range. Various forms of ribbed axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in around a dozen known hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales.

Two slender faceted axes (Nos. 5 & 6, above) may be identified as of Type Meldreth or Class D faceted axes, which have a variety of sub-types, dependent upon the shape and depth of their collar and mouth shape (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 204-11; Needham 1990, 41-3; Gwilt et al 2005, 37-8). This type is generally regarded as of British type, although they do occur in Ireland and France (O' Connor 1980, 166-7; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 53-62, Cats. 296-392). Nearly all of the known hoard associations containing these axes are securely of Late Bronze Age date and belonging to the Ewart Park phase between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61), although a few examples have been found in slightly earlier Late Bronze Age hoards dating to 1150-1000 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 210-1; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2001, 61).

Having identified all six socketed axes reported from this immediate localised find-spot, it is apparent that all are securely of Ewart Park date of manufacture, dating to between 1000-800 BC. The account of discovery strongly suggests that the hoard group had remained buried together until the recent past in small pit feature cutting into a protected soil beneath a Medieval to post-Medieval field bank and hedge-line. In recent years, the farmer created a new entrance across this field boundary, by digging out and flattening the boundary in this localised area. This event disturbed the ancient soil beneath the bank, causing the artefacts in the hoard to be scattered over an area of 4m, to either side of the new entrance. Their reported depths of 15-25cm are consistent with having been moved within bank material and redeposited and compacted at moderate depth within the soil levelling activity.

859261,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-900,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed spearhead dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age c.1400-900 BC. The spearhead has a slender, tapering leaf-shaped (ogival) blade with slightly bevelled edges and two undrilled lozenge-shaped side 'loops' located near to the mouth of the socket, which is circular in plan and tapers internally. The spearhead is in good condition with some bronze disease and corrosion evident.



The loops may have been miscast as they are solid rather than having on internal eye. Spearheads with similar miscastings have been found locally; one from the same parish as this new example, now in the Ashmolean Museum (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706), another from Standlake (Ash.M. 1911.137) and a third recently recorded only c. 1 kilometre from this new example (BERK-5BCE29 on this database). Ehrenberg (1977:7) suggests that such miscast examples or those with unmade loops may indicate that the shaft of the spear was simply wedged in to the socket and not secured by strings. The shape of the blade may be the result of resharpening (Ibid; after Davey 1973:79).



The internal diameter of the socket is 13.65mm.

859294,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2050,"Early Bronze Age hoard comprising one flat axe and one axe-chisel.



1. Flat axe - Type Barton Stacey (Class 3D)



Dimensions: maximum length 156.0mm; width of butt 34.2mm; blade width 98.1mm; maximum thickness 9.2mm; weight 475.2g.



This is a complete flat axe in good condition, with original surfaces surviving over the majority of the axe. The axe is narrow-butted and wide-bladed and has a lenticular profile. The sides of the axe are gently concave, expanding modestly from the butt to the blade end. There is slight triple faceting visible down the sides of the axe, indicating that these were hammered after casting. Hammering of the side facets has led to the face-edges becoming crisp and very slightly raised in places, however this is not deliberate and visible enough to constitute true low hammered flanges. The butt of the axe is curved with a low to medium arch. There is no central stop bevel on the faces of the axe. The broad cutting edge has a shallow blade bevel, approximately 7mm in depth. Striations are evident on the lower face and blade bevel, running parallel with the long-axis of the axe, indicating the blade was prepared for use. There is differential patination evident on the axe, one face being green and the other being dark-grey green. Along one side of the dark-grey green face, there is an elongate strip of mottled surface matching the size and dimensions of the axe-chisel. This provides evidence that the axe and axe-chisel were carefully placed together, one immediately on top of the other. A localised area of black patination extends across half of the blade bevel on the reverse axe face with green patination. On the butt end of the face with green patination, a modern diagonal scrape is also evident, revealing a small area of fresh bronze metal. A second less deep diagonal scratch is also evident on the same face at the lower blade end. This is likely to have occurred during recent removal of the axe from the ground by the finder. In places along the face-edges and blade-edge original surfaces have been lost, revealing grey-green areas of sub-surface. In places along face-edges, there is also localised surface cracking evident on original surfaces, indicating these areas to be fragile and unstable.



2. Axe-chisel (Class 3)



Dimensions: maximum length 110.6mm; width of butt 14.8mm; blade width 44.6mm; maximum thickness 6.1mm; weight 84.4g.



This is a complete slender axe-chisel in good condition, with original surfaces surviving over the majority of the artefact. The axe-chisel is narrow butted and lenticular in profile. The sides of the axe-chisel are gently concave, expanding modestly from the butt to the blade end. The butt of the axe-chisel is curved with a low arch. There is no central stop bevel on the axe-chisel faces. On the lower face, near the blade edge surface striations are evident, generally aligned parallel with the artefact long axis and suggesting it was prepared for use. The axe-chisel has a mottled and variable coloured patina, ranging from green, grey-green to green-brown. One face has appreciable surface concretions, which are black and brown in colour and this would appear to have been the surface which was laid directly against the flat axe (above). Along one upper side towards the butt end, there is a linear groove or scratch, which has exposed fresh bronze metal and this appears to be recent. There is a circular scar on one upper face, near the face-edge, which appears to have been created by being recently knocked, to remove an area of fragile original surface. Near the butt end and at the blade margins, there are small areas where original surfaces have been lost, revealing grey green areas of powdery sub-surface.","The flat axe (No. 1, above) may be identified as a Class 3 flat axe, of the 3D sub-class named Type Barton Stacey. This identification is based upon a combination of stylistic and technological features and metrical measurements and ratios, as defined and developed by Needham in relation to the Early Bronze Age axes of central and southern England (Needham 1983; forthcoming). As such, this may be correlated with the Brithdir Assemblage (Period 2; Metalwork Assemblage III) at the very beginning of bronze casting in Britain around 2200/2150-2050 BC (e.g. Needham 1985, iii; 1996, 127-30; forthcoming; Needham et al 2015, 35-6; Rohl & Needham 1998,

88-9). These forms of flat axe are fairly well represented in Wales and The Marches.



The second smaller artefact (No. 2, above), may be identified as a Class 3 axe-chisel, based upon its stylistic and technological features, size and proportions. Class 3 axes and axe-chisels are diagnostic of the Brithdir and Mile Cross Assemblages (Period 2/ earlier Period 3; Metalwork Assemblages III & IV) in Britain between around 2200/2150-1950 BC (e.g. Needham 1985, iii; 1996, 127-32; forthcoming; Rohl & Needham 1998, 88-90). However, the features and proportions evident on this example are similar to those witnessed on the associated flat axe. This strongly supports the notion that this axe-chisel may also be dated to the Brithdir Assemblage (Period 2; Metalwork Assemblage III) and dating to around 2200/2150-2050 BC.



Class 3 axe-chisels are less common than Class 3 axes, though their frequency has been increasing in recent years through metal detected finds reported via the Portable Antiquities Scheme.



The finder's account of the discovery, a preliminary archaeological investigation of the find-spot of the hoard and careful observation of the two artefacts have provided important information about the manner of their burial in the ground. The finder reported the two artefacts were found lying flat, with the axe-chisel lying on the flat axe at a depth of approximately 30cm beneath the surface and beneath a large flat stone. It is highly probable that these two bronze artefacts were carefully placed together within a small pit, dug during the Early Bronze Age, which was quickly infilled and covered and concealed with a large limestone capping stone.



Metallurgical analysis of the flat axe and axe-chisel has confirmed that both artefacts are made of a tin bronze, with significant presence of arsenic as an impurity. This alloy composition adds weight to their dating attribution to the Brithdir Assemblage at the very beginning of bronze casting in Britain (ca. 2200/2150-2050 BC). Lead isotope analyses of other contemporary bronze flat axes from Britain have strengthened the evidence for a continuing use of arsenical copper sources within flat axes of this earliest bronze tradition (Rohl & Needham 1998, 88-9, Plots 26A & B) and the arsenical presence detected in this flat axe and axe-chisel is consistent with this picture. Analysis has also confirmed that both artefacts had extremely similar alloy signatures and were cast from the same metal alloy composition. This provides an additional strand of evidence in support of the contemporaneity of these two artefacts.

Bronze Age copper-alloy fragmentary metal work hoard which had been stored in a ceramic vessel that had later been hit by a plough/farm machinery and partially scattered a small distance around the location of the vessel. Some fragments of metal were still within the cracked vessel while others had dispersed slightly.



61 sherds of ceramic vessel (possibly Deverel Rimbury ware). 21 of these sherds are extremely small fragments. At least two of the larger sherds cross-fit.





8 fragments (of possible scabbard chape) with more than two sides.

40 fragments of probable scabbard chape with two sides present (one with an interesting square notch at break), 10 of which seem to have shaped top edges.

102 fragments of single side of probable scabbard chape (very thin sheet metal most but not all have at least one rib). One not photographed with the others.

8 fragments that seem to be from a hollow artefact more solid than a scabbard chape. One has a circular notch at the break.

21 fragments which have one or more rib on one surface and are fairly chunky/solid and relatively flat.

Part of the socket has been broken off and the tip pf the spearhead is missing. The blades are short and leaf-shaped. The hollow of the socket extends 46 mm into the the spear. It is circular and tapers towards the tip, becoming lozengiform in cross section as it develops into the solid mid-rib between the blades. There are two small, oval, pierced side loops set opposite each other part way along the socket. There are traces of casting lines along the sides of the spearhead running from above the side loops to the base of the blades. Below the side loops, the casting lines appear to have been smoothed away.

Dot Boughton suggests LANCUM-7609C0 on the PAS database as a parrallel in which record she notes ""Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal.

859659,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1250,"A cast copper alloy slender un-looped Middle Bronze Age palstave, probably from the Taunton metalwork phase and dating from c. 1500- 1300 BC. The cutting edge has a pronounced crescentic form with the tips re-curving back onto the expanding form of the blade body. The body has a well-defined stop ridge just short of midway down its length and the flanges extend and taper, down to the blade section. There are clear casting lines down each side of the axe, there are no other design elements to be seen.



The blade appears to have been lightly used with a few small indentations and modest striations over its surface. However, it can't be ruled out that the markings are from its time and movement in the ground. The surface looks to have been 'treated' in some way with the resultant loss of the original patination - the finder reports that this palstave was found during works on a medieval moated site in the 1980s, and appears to have come from the dredge of the moat. This may explain the surface appearance of the axe. This palstave is unusual in the inclusion of flange extensions on the side of the blade but without a central midrib. Rowlands (1976: plate 26, nos. 252, 189, 238) illustrates three similar examples which he define as his type 2 (side flanged) form dating to c. 1500-1150 cal BC. There are no good parallels illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) although the form most closely corresponds to their Group 2 (early Mid ribbed) due to the flange extensions. They suggest this form is one of the earlier tpyes dating to the Acton Park to Taunton Phase of the bronze Age c.1500-1250 cal BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,477.4,,,29.4,70.1,1,Rod Trevaskus,Rod Trevaskus,South East,Oxfordshire,South Oxfordshire,Lewknor,SU7097,From finder,51.66742567,-0.98924246,BERK-41E4C6,,BERK41E4C6.jpg,Palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BERK41E4C6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/624769.jpg

860042,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete middle Bronze Age copper alloy palstave, probably dating to c. 1500-1300 BC. The palstave is 148.8mm long, with the stop ridge being 62.1mm from the butt. Both the butt end and septum are rectangular, the latter being 10.8mm deep at the stop ridge, which is angled, sloping inwards. The flanges, 3.1mm thick, are lozenge-shaped when viewed in profile, reaching a maximum width of 34.1mm, expanding from 27.8mm at the stop ridge. In plan, the palstave is measures 16.6mm wide at the butt, expanding immediately below it to reach a maximum of 22.6mm roughly in line with the beginning of the flanges. The width then remains largely consistent, being 21.2mm at the stop ridge, below which point the blade begins to flare outwards in a gradual curve, reaching 58.7mm wide at the cutting edge, which is crescentic, with unflaired tips. In profile the blade is broadly triangular, narrowing immediately below the stop ridge in a curved line to 17.4mm, from which point the narrowing is more gradual, tapering to a point at the cutting edge. The blade is unflanged.



The palstave is looped, the inclusion of which takes the maximum width to 29.3mm, the lower edge of the loop is in line with the stop ridge, and it is 20.8mm long and 9.1mm wide (when the palstave is viewed in profile). Both sides of the palstave have longitudinal casting seams, relatively unpronounced. Both faces of the blade feature trident decoration immedieately below the stop ridge, this being a short central mid-rid contained within a shield shaped depression, itself defined by slightly raised ridges.



Overall dimensions: length 148.8mm; width 58.7mm; thickness 34.1mm; weight 333g.



A Palstave featuring very similar ""trident"" decoration can be seen illustrated by Pearce (1984, no. 809), described as being of high-flanged South-Western type. Another comparable palstave, although with lower flanges is published by Knight, Omrod & Pearce (2015, no. 460), from a small hoard in Somerset. Comparable palstaves on this database include LVPL-135122 and WAW-B8887E.

860485,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1725,-1500,"A complete copper alloy Early Bronze Age flanged axehead.



This axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, but not recurving. Cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a very shallow lenticular side profile. The flanges are slightly triple-faceted, so are slightly angled inwards on both faces and on one side very faint traces of decoration can be observed when lit correctly along the central, flat facet; this decoration appears to be hammered, angled corded decoration.



The axe has a curved bevel or ridge about halfway down the septum (c.53.5mm from the butt), which is marginally lower than the flanges, but indicates the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion, though this is clearer on the better preserved face and a shallow groove can be observed, emphasising this ridge. The cutting edge is quite deep (26mm) and has an even crescentic cutting edge, though this has slightly abraded as a result of corrosion.



On the better preserved face, on the inside of the flange on the right hand side of the septum below the bevel (when looked at in plan), there are two or three small angular indentations that are likely associated with working of the axe (e.g. hammering), but could represent the remains of decoration. The expansion of the blade is likely a combination of the original cast shape and hammering/working of the blade post-casting.



Very little of the original surface of the axe is preserved. On one face there is dark green patina, preserving subtler features, but this is overall pocked with pale green corrosion. The sides of the axe are similar pocked and the opposite face is almost entirely covered in green corrosive build-up, which is particularly extensive on the blade and cutting edge.



Length 122mm; blade width (tip to tip) 60.5mm; butt width 20.5mm; max. flange breadth 15mm; max. flange height c.2mm; bevel thickness (at centre) c.12.5mm; body width (at bevel) 26mm; weight 250.3g.","The height of the flanges (i.e. above 1.5mm) and overall form of the axe means it can be confidently classed as a low-flanged axe, datable to the Arreton assemblage (c.1725-1500 cal. BC)/Period 4 of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997). The axe can be classed as Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 72-75) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming). Class 5 axes can be further sub-divided by taking additional measurements according to Needham (1983; forthcoming), specifically relating to the 'mean relative width of the body (MRW)' i.e. the breadth of the body. This axe possesses a MRW of 0.75mm, which can be considered 'slender' and falls within Needham's (forthcoming) Class 5B Bisham.



Class 5B axes are known from across southern Britain, with examples of similar sizes from Syon Reach, Gloucestershire (Needham 1983, GL 20) and Milverton, Somerset (ibid., So 3/3). The depth of the Cowbridge blade/cutting edge (i.e. 26mm) is quite large considering the overall length of this axe, but an axe with similar proportions of length, blade depth and width can be observed in the Poslingford hoard, Suffolk (Needham 1983, Sf 26/7). This axe also has faceted flanges, though differs from the Cowbridge axe in having recurved blade tips and a shallower bevel.



The bevel on the Cowbridge axe is quite unusual and can be considered a 'stop-bump' (following Needham forthcoming), which anticipates the technological development of full stop ridges as seen on later flanged axes (specifically palstaves); this feature might thus indicate this axe can be dated later within the Arreton assemblage.



Needham (1983, 198) lists 179 Class 5 axes from southern Britain, indicating the broad currency of this axe type. In Wales, approximately 25 examples are currently known from both hoards and isolated contexts, with recent discoveries rapidly changing the image of how these axes were circulated. Class 5 axes are present in hoards from Menai Bridge, Anglesey (Savory 1980, 115, No.259), Llanover, Monmouthshire (NMGW-3F3BBC) and Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0B9997). Single finds are also known from Margam, Neath Port Talbot (Savory 1976; 1980, 102, No.122), Bangor Is-y-coed, Wrexham (CPAT-9DFD01) and Llanbradach and Pwllypant, Caerphilly (NMGW-CD7412).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,250.3,,,,122,1,Matthew Knight,Matthew Knight,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Cowbridge with Llanblethian,SS9874,From a paper map,51.45575985,-3.46943322,NMGW-C21D78,,cowbridgeaxe.jpg,Bronze Age flanged axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/cowbridgeaxe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/631085.jpg
860517,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-300,"A complete cast copper alloy moustache-like object probably dating from the Middle Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age (1500-300 BC).

The object consists of two pointed drop-shaped elements, D-shaped in cross-section and joined at their wider, rounded ends by a short, recessed oval neck. There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both domed sides of the object, the tapering lower parts are plain. The two moustache tips or prongs flare slightly outwards and terminate with a small rounded knop. The central neck section of the object is plain and undecorated but the underside (between the two prongs) has a squared perforation, now filled with iron corrosion, presumably from whatever object the 'moustache' was mount on to.","These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45 and BH-AA1CBE.



The open area at the centre of the object suggests it was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-06-03T23:00:00Z,,,,11,,,8.7,21.1,1,Anni Byard,Anni Byard,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor,SU3995,From a paper map,51.65244492,-1.43767284,BERK-C3E5A3,,2017188.jpg,Unidentified object: Bronze Age mount,Oxfordshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017188.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/627058.jpg

1. Ribbed socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: surviving length70.3mm; surviving blade width 44.2mm; width at upper break approx.33.5mm; surviving depth of socket approx. 49.0mm; surviving weight 110.9g.



Blade and body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze, with the mouth, loop, upper body and one side missing. Three near parallel ribs descend down each face. The surviving axe side is near straight, but slightly divergent toward the blade end, with a slight outward curvature near the blade. The surviving face edges are rounded giving the axe a sub-rectangular shaped cross-section. The surviving casting seam is visible but has been carefully filed or hammered down. On one lower face, there are striations running parallel with the blade edge and slightly higher up, striations running parallel with the long axis and at near right-angles with those nearer the blade edge. These suggest the axe was once prepared and sharpened for use. The original blade edge has been completely eroded away and the surviving edge surfaces are fragile with a light green patina. All break edges are fragile, with a light green patina. On the side which is largely missing, the surviving lower side area is also highly eroded, also with a light green patina. Original surfaces have a grey green patina. Across one face, near and at right angles to the ends of the face-ribs, there is a linear surface scar, which looks modern and may be slight damage caused when the axe was discovered and removed from the ground.



2. Probable plano-convex ingot fragment



Dimensions: maximum length 59.3mm; maximum width 39.5mm; maximum thickness 20.4mm; surviving weight 153.9g.



A solid and heavy copper fragment with two convex shaped sides and highly eroded surfaces. In cross-section, the fragment is thinnest near one of the convex shaped edges and significantly thickens to the second convex shaped edge, which has a near vertical but heavily eroded break edge. One surface is slightly irregular but nearing flat, while the underside has a marked convex curve as it thickens from edge toward deeper centre. The underside has a green patina, while the upper surface and breaks have large areas of brown coloured surface with localised areas of green surface concretions.","The socketed axe fragment (No. 1) may be identified as of a ribbed form, however insufficient of the axe survives to be able to identify it to precise type. The rounded face edges, carefully filed or hammered casting seam and generally slender, rather than blocky proportions of this axe would tend to suggest that this was not an example of a South Wales type axe (e.g. McNeil 1973; Moore 1978; Needham 1981; 1990, 38-41; Gwilt 2004; Burgess 2012; Northover unpublished). It is possible that this could once have been a Class B Southern English ribbed axe, or a ribbed axe of Breiddin, Croxton or Llanarth forms (Burgess 1963; Needham 1990, 32-8; Coombs 1991, 133 & 136, Cat. 138, Fig. 56; Northover unpublished, 267), however the absence of upper body and mouth elements prevent attribution with any degree of confidence. As a socketed axe, this artefact may confidently be dated to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC), while probably belonging to the latter Ewart Park phase of this period (1000-800 BC).



The second fragment (No. 2) has shape characteristics consistent with being a fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Typical features include a round or oval plan shape, with an irregular but flatter upper surface, with a convex shaped underside, shallow at margins and deepening towards the centre. Its eroded surfaces and breaks suggest the fragment had been within the upper aerated soil for some time. Metallurgical analysis of the probable ingot fragment has shown it to be made of copper, with traces of arsenic and silver detected. Such a composition is consistent with other examples of copper ingot fragments known within Late Bronze Age hoards in Wales (Gwilt et al 2011; 2014a & b). As such, a reasonable case can be made for the contemporaneity of these two artefacts, both of Late Bronze Age date and probably dating to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC).



Plano-convex ingot fragments become common components of hoards towards the end of the Late Bronze Age. Over 40 Carp's Tongue hoards of Ewart Park date, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex copper alloy ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). In Pembrokeshire, ingot fragments appear to form a major component of the Late Bronze Age hoards from Freshwater West, Marloes & St Brides and Manorbier (Gwilt et al 2011; 2014b; Murphy unpublished; Northover unpublished, H. 140).



The account of the discovery of these two artefacts suggests that they were probably disturbed from their original burial context and dispersed from each other over a short distance (1.8m) in the recent past. It is probable that these two artefacts, and possibly additional objects now lost, were buried together in the ground at the same time, probably in a purpose dug small pit feature. It is likely that the objects were disturbed and became slightly dispersed through agricultural or earth moving activity during the recent past. It is possible that the mouth and loop end of the axe became damaged and lost when or after it was disturbed.

The fragment of axe survives in the shape of a rough treapezium, with the wider, blade end being more rounded. In cross section it is rectangular to the narrower end and becomes more pointed oval in cross-section towards the blade edge. Due to have pitting no detail of casting seam or simialr casting imperfections are visible. In profile the cutting edge narrows to a rounded point, it is narrow which suggests that it is probably a transitional palstave, although due to wear it is not possible to be certain. There is a worn break across the body of the axe head, and much of the blade appears to be missing likely due to wear/resharpening. The axe head has a dark green mottled patina with patches of light great particularly around the heavy pitting on its surface. All edges are heavily worn suggesting much of the damage occured in antiquity.

The axehead has been damaged and is missing the loop that would have been attached to the top side. The blade has been worn down and is quite corroded, giving it a straigter profile rather than the more usual crescent. The sides of the axehead are smooth and the socket is almost circular in cross section. There is a defeined casting seam along the top and bottom edges. The axe has a slight taper from the blade but flares outward again at the socket. There is no decoration around the socket mouth.

861289,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Probable Bronze Age gold strip fragment.



This is a semi-worked thickened strip fragment of gold of broadly rectangular shape. The strip has been worked and there are hammer facets visible on the flat surfaces and side margins. One edge has been hammered up and has a projecting margin on one face edge. The strip was broken at one end with a double-grip tool without sharp edges. As a result, there is widening, lateral distortion with thinning at one end, near the break. On one face, the break has created a near flat angled facet, while on the reverse there is a distinct concave curvature of the break, where gripped. The opposite end looks to have been snapped, rather than pulled, the break edge being irregular and with no thinning and minimal distortion of shape evident. Projecting burrs on the face edges look to have been hammered down. On one face, there is a linear crack evident in the metal along the axis of the strip, while a second smaller area of surface cracking is also evident. The gold has a yellowish tinge, rather than tending toward silver or having an orange hue.



Dimensions: maximum length 12.7mm; maximum width 8.5mm; maximum thickness 2.8mm; weight 2.37g.","Metallurgical analysis (Mary Davis)



Method



Semi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold strip was undertaken for the gold, silver and copper content of the gold fragment. This was achieved using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HH-XRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6µA for 100 live seconds.

Surface analysis is susceptible to distortions due to the asymmetry of whole objects (rather that flat polished samples). Surface corrosion can lead to the surface enrichment (e.g. tin) and depletion (e.g. zinc) of elements.



Results



Three spectra were taken of the object, which was found not to be particularly homogeneous in composition, and the overall results averaged:

Gold: 85-87%;

Silver: 10-12%

Copper: 2-2.5%



Interpretation



The amount of copper and silver present in the gold fragment is consistent with a typical Bronze Age composition. The results sit within the known range of compositions of gold objects from Wales of either Middle or Late Bronze Age date (e.g. Gwilt et al 2005, 36 & Fig. 4).



Identification & discussion (Adam Gwilt)



As a fragment of semi-worked gold, it is not possible to identify this with certainty to a class of finished gold artefact type of known period or date. The hammering and working technique observed on this fragment (see above description) is consistent with observed Bronze Age working technology, however is not, in itself, diagnostic to a particular date.

In this instance, it is the metallurgical analysis of the composition of this gold fragment which provides the most instructive evidence as to the possible age of this object. The high, but not refined gold content in this strip fragment, in the range of 85-87% gold and with 10-12% silver content is consistent with known Bronze Age gold compositions, to some degree reflecting the natural incidence of silver within alluvial gold ores. Copper was deliberately added to gold alloys in the Bronze Age, with the general trend for increasing proportions of copper with time, Late Bronze Age artefacts generally containing 4-10% copper and Early Bronze Age gold generally with less than 1% copper content (e.g. Hartmann 1980; Northover 1993, 517, Fig. 2). This strip, containing 2.0-2.5% copper sits in the overlap zone with other gold artefacts dating to the Middle and Late Bronze Age (Gwilt et al 2005, 36 & Fig. 4). Typically, Roman gold is highly refined, with the silver and copper content removed, giving the metal a more reddish colour.



Part-worked or re-worked fragments of Bronze Age gold are sometimes discovered, as single finds or as elements within hoards (e.g. Green 1983; Green & Northover 1996; Gwilt et al 2005; DCMS 2004, 19, Cat. & Fig. 11; DCMS 2007, 22-3, 26, & 39, Cats. & Figs. 5, 7, 17 & 25; British Museum 2008, 22 & 24, 273-5, Cats. & Figs. 27, 33 & 34). Their occurrence as single finds has been increasing in recent years, as better levels of reporting treasure finds have been achieved through the Portable Antiquities Scheme in England and Wales. Therefore, the possibility of this strip being a single find of Bronze Age date is also consistent with a wider reported pattern.



A preliminary search of the Heritage Environment Record for Monmouthshire has indicated there are no known Bronze Age or prehistoric sites in the immediate landscape vicinity of the find-spot.

861731,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1900,"A highly abraded Bronze Age copper alloy miniature flat axehead, probably dating to c. 2150-1900 BC. The axehead is broadly sub-rectangular in plan and rectangular in cross-section. The axe expands from a now rounded butt, 19.6mm wide, to the mid-point, 22.8mm wide. Below the mid-point, which is thickened in profile, 9.2mm thick compared to 4.6mm at the butt, there is break in angle, with the blade expanding to 28.2mm, where it terminates in a curved cutting edge. There is the suggestion of flanges running down either edge of the axehead, though they are difficult to discern by eye, and they are more prominent at the butt end - although the abrasion means that it is impossible to be sure if this was so originally.



Dimensions: length 63.3mm; width 28.2mm; thickness 9.2mm; weight 59.91g.



The axehead can be compared in terms of its general proportions to axes of the Brithdir metalworking phase published by Rohl and Needham (1998: fig. 24, esp. nos. 35 & 36), which share this example's relatively broad butt and lack of flaring blade tips. Although extremely small, a great variation in terms of size is a noted feature of axes of this period, with these smaller axes probably bing used for lighter woodworking (Moore & Rowlands 1972:13).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2017-08-15T23:00:00Z,,,59.91,,,9.2,63.3,1,Wil Partridge,Wil Partridge,South West,Devon,South Hams,Sparkwell,SX5858,Centred on field,50.40467111,-3.99957782,DEV-B0516A,,DEVB0516A.JPG,Bronze Age flat axehead,Somerset County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEVB0516A.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/627492.jpg

862530,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete copper alloy Middle Bronze Age unlooped palstave axehead (c.1500-c.1300 BC). The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves. These were the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age Schmidt and Burgess 1981). This particular axehead is probably a Group I (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, distinguished by its shield-shaped decoration below the stop ridge (ibid.p.119). The axe is sub-triangular in plan and sub-rectangular in section, tapering to the blade terminal. The blade is narrow tapering and the axe is narrow and unlooped and the butt is broken. The patination suggests that itv was broken in antiquity. The axe has a well-defined, rounded stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. There are two pronounced flanges on either side which have been filed smooth. The septum is smooth and seemingly unworn and slightly inwardly curving. At the end of the septum is a moulded shield-shaped stop-ridge set transversely across the body. The blade is flared and the surface is smooth, bevelled and sharpened. Group I and II palstaves were the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (ibid.p.119). This axe can be assigned to the Acton Park or early Taunton phase, circa 1450-1300 BC. The patination is a mid-green and pitting in the body of the axe suggests casting issues. The length is 160mm, the width is 53mm thickness 40mm and the weight too heavy for scales.



Pearce calls these palstaves 'the backbone of the Middle bronze Age industry' (page 23). They are a technical improvement on the ealrier flanged axes. The earliest palstaves lack side loops and have their blades decorated with a midrib (Group 1 type) like that from Chepstow, or with a shield pattern (Group 2 type). Early midrib and shield pattern palstaves were also being manufactured byt the Acton Park smiths of North Wales and by smiths in eastern Britain before 1400 BC.

The axe is sub-triangular in plan and sub-rectangular in section, tapering to the blade terminal. The blade is narrow tapering and the axe is narrow and unlooped. The blade is flared and the surface is smooth, bevelled and sharpened. The butt is broken and the patination suggests that it was broken in antiquity. The axe has a well-defined stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. The septum is H-shaped in section and is smooth, unworn and slightly concave. At the end of the septum is a moulded shield-shaped stop-ridge set transversely across the body. The patination is a mid-green with areas of dark grey patination on both faces of the septum. The length is 100.22mm, the width is at the blade is 37.16mm and at the butt is 21.94mm. Its thickness is 6.62mm at the blade, 11.30mm at the butt and 19.66mm at the stop ridge. It weighs 166.2g.



The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops or midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group I (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC. It can be distinguished by its shield-shaped decoration below the stop ridge (p.119).



Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.



The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches.

The palstave has an oval shaped profile with the widest section being before the stop ridge closer to the butt end. At this widest section the palstave measures 27.06 mm in width.



The palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The flanges have suffered some damaged at the edges. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 26.38 mm in width and 6.12 mm thick. No side loop is present.



Beneath the stop-ridge descends a vertical rib that extends to the mid point on the upper blade. The blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical. The original surface is damaged. The cutting edge measures 59.11 mm in width and is 14.05 mm thick which includes the rib.



The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.



Early Midribbed Palstaves belongs to the Acton Park metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. This example is similar to Group II - Early Midribbed Type Chepstow; similar to an example from Kilnoterie, Scotland (p127 cat no 794 plate 58, No. 789). 



There are other axeheads of the Early Palstave Group II - Early Mid-ribbed Type recorded on the PAs database and discovered in Warwickshire such as WAW-245FB6 and WMID-7493D3. 



Overall the palstave measures 150.8 mm in length, a maximum width of 59.11 mm at the cutting edge, and a maximum thickness near the stop ridge of 27.06 mm. It weighs 292.3 g.

The present 73mm diameter annular shape is formed from circular-section bronze rod which has been twisted into a spiral. The ends slightly overlap and both have been broken in antiquity. On one of the broken ends the twist and cross-section begins to taper-off suggesting that the break is close to a missing hooked-end terminal. The other end is an abrupt break across full twist and cross-section. The evidence strongly suggests that this object is part of a larger penannular twisted torc, that has broken and been reformed into a bracelet-sized loop. It is a matter of conjecture as to whether this happened as a result of deliberate re-puposing, ceremonial practice or simple coincidence. Approximately 50% of the objects surface is covered with a dark green patina, the remainder comprises a lighter green mottled corrosion product formed from the breakdown of the patina.

870383,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Early Bronze Age bronze Developed flat axe, of Class 4 (following Needham 1983) or probably of Type Scrabo Hill (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 63-5) and of Metalwork Assemblage IV to V, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 3; dated to 2,050BC - 1,700BC.



The axe is near-complete but is heavily corroded with some peripheral loss (with a surviving length of 132.4mm and a weight of 295.4g). The butt is rounded (with a width of 31.1mm) and it is now uncertain how much rounding has resulted from corrosion. The sides of the axe are comparatively straight and gradually divergent to the blade. One side expands more sharply below the blade and suggests that the blade originally had at least a moderately expanded blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 56.2mm). The long profile of the axe is lenticular and the better preserved face has the suggestion of a median bevel (occurring approximately 60mm from the butt, where the axe has a maximum thickness of 12.0mm). A small fragment of the surface survives on the side of the face, just above the median bevel where a weak flange is discernible. A blade facet is evident on the better preserved face (13mm from the blade edge). The original blade edge has been lost and is now moderately rounded. Small remnant patches of the original surface survive which show that the axe was decorated with short linear and parallel marks or 'rain-pattern' decoration. A longer surviving strip of surface appears to show where the decoration ends (32mm from the blade) and the surface then exhibits striations running along the blade, probably from sharpening. The surface patina is dark-brown and elsewhere is heavily-pitted with a pale to mid-green corrosion.","Metallurgical analysis was attempted, where the axe was examined whole within the specimen chamber. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from under the surface corrosion were analysed and apart from very superficial surface swabbing of the artefacts there was no sample preparation. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion.



Three separate readings were taken and the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable with other results the average compositions were: 79-86% copper, 14-20% tin with minimal amounts of lead detected (0.1-0.2%).

870386,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Early Bronze Age bronze ogival dagger of Camerton-Snowshill Type (following Gerloff 1975), or Series 5D (following Needham 2015) and of Needham's (1996)  Period 4-5, probably dating from c.1600 to 1400BC.



The dagger is incomplete, missing the tip and with peripheral damage (with a surviving length of 67.8mm and a weight of 32.2g). The butt end is eroded and of uncertain form but now with a straight top edge (with a surviving width of 25.6mm and a minimum thickness of 1.8mm), possibly suggesting it was originally of trapezoidal form. There appears to have been three rivet holes, for plug-rivets, two of which are evident, including a central rivet hole (of 6.2mm diameter). The side rivet is less well preserved (with a diameter of 5mm). The dagger widens and thickens to the top of the blade, incorporating the prominent midrib (giving the blade a maximum surviving width of 34.5mm and a maximum thickness of 6.5mm). The central midrib is widest at the hilt (at 19mm), with straight and convergent sides, gradually narrowing to the break (where it has a width of 9mm). Flanking the midrib on each side are three to four decorative rounded ridges, separated from each other by grooves. The decorative ridges are very slightly concave, extending from the butt to the break. There is the suggestion that the decorative ridges may continue as far as the better preserved side rivet hole. There is no convincing evidence of pointillé decoration on the midrib, or elsewhere on the blade. At the break (where the blade has a width of 16mm and a thickness of 4.5mm) the blade has a gentle bend, suggesting the tip was bent prior to breaking in antiquity. Both blade edges have been lost, but there are discernible sharpening striations running along both blade edges on both faces. The surface is partially preserved with a dark-brown patina and is heavily-pitted. The corrosion on both faces at the hilt has a V-shaped form, extending onto the midrib and may possibly suggest a V-shaped hilt handle, which would be unusual, and differs from the more common omega-shaped arrangement at the hilt.","Metallurgical analysis was conducted using X-ray fluorescence, demonstrating that the metal is an arsenical tin-bronze and is consistent with Early and Middle Bronze Age alloys.



The incomplete and corroded nature of the dagger makes precise typological identification difficult. The straight heel edge may be comparatively intact, which would tentatively suggest a trapezoidal butt arrangement, characteristic of the Camerton Type, as defined by Gerloff (1975, pp 104). Camerton-Snowshill daggers are generally deposited within burials and have a date range that is believed to span the Early to Middle Bronze Age transition, dated to c. 1600 - 1400. In Wales the dagger can be paralleled with an example recovered from Ystradyfodwg (Savory, 1980, pp 132, no. 335) , on the border of Glyncorrwg, Neath-Port Talbot and Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taff.

The dagger is incomplete, missing the hilt and is slightly distorted (with a surviving length of 112.1mm and a weight of 31.5g). The damaged butt is now of indeterminate form (with a maximum surviving width of 30.7mm and a thickness of 0.8mm) but there is the remains of a rivet hole or notch at the apex of the centre (of approximately 5.3mm diameter). The dagger thickens at its centre to form a prominent, rounded midrib (reaching a maximum thickness of 6.2mm, 30mm from the damaged butt), which narrows and becomes more angular towards the tip. The dagger is decorated with two prominent grooves, beginning at the butt and converging along the midrib (approximately 27mm from the tip). There is the suggestion of a third, outer groove at the butt, which goes on to define the edge of the midrib and start of the blade and continues to the tip. There is no evidence for punched-dot pointillé decoration on the dagger. The blade is flat sectioned (0.6mm - 1.2mm thick) and narrows slightly towards the tip (with a width of 4.5mm near the butt and 2mm near the tip). The original blade edge has largely been lost and the edge is near-straight and gradually convergent to the tip. There are no sharpening striations discernible on the small areas of surviving surface preserved along the blade. The dagger has received a blow to one face at its midpoint, probably in antiquity and resulting in slight distortion and surface damage, comprising a short diagonal groove on the midrib (approximately 2mm long and 0.7mm wide) and stress lines evident on the surface. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of pale brown corrosion with patches of bright-green surface loss. The patina may be preserved with an omega-like mark on one face, possibly suggesting the remains of a hilt.","The fragmentary condition of the dagger butt makes precise typological identification difficult. The central rivet hole or notch arrangement, characteristic of the Camerton Type, as defined by Gerloff (1975, pp 104) . Camerton-Snowshill daggers are generally deposited within burials with a largely Wiltshire and Dorset distribution and have a date range that is believed to span the Early to Middle Bronze Age transition, dated to c. 1600 - 1400. The wetland context for this findspot is unlikely to suggest that it accompanied a burial. In Wales the dagger can be paralleled with an example recovered from Ystradyfodwg (Savory, 1980, pp 132, no. 335) , on the border of Glyncorrwg, Neath-Port Talbot and Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taff. A similar fragmentary dagger with a slightly broader butt and also of Camerton - Snowshill Series was reported to PAS  and recovered from approximately 4Km to the south.

Discussion: This hoard of three socketed tools, two complete bun ingots and 22 fragments of bun ingot is consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, especially with the Ewart Park phase (c.1000 – 800 BC) (cf. Needham 1990). Perhaps the most notable feature of the hoard is the relative paucity of socketed tools compare to ingot (fragments and complete). Complete (or near complete) bun ingots formed part of the Bexley Heath hoard, Essex (Turner 2010, 126-39, no. 15). Other relevant comparanda include the hoard from ‘Burnham on Crouch’, Essex, which contained socketed tools, weapons and fragments of copper alloy ingot (Treasure case 2010 T509), and the hoard from ‘East Colchester’, Essex, which contained socketed tools, complete and fragmentary ingot fragments (Treasure case 2004 T116).

873275,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Cast bronze socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 800 BC). The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge and the socket is sub-rectangular in cross section. The axe measures 99.6mm length, 45.8mm in width at the blade, 35.8mm at the socket, it is 33.7mm thick and weighs 174.25 grams. The depth of the socket is 65.3mm.



The socket of the axe is sub-rectangular with patinated breaks around three sides which have removed the original end of the socket. The remaining complete section has a single swollen moulded collar up to 8.6mm wide. Only the inner stub of the loop survives the middle is missing to an old break and the other end has been lost with the mouth suggesting it was on or adjacent to the collar.



The two long sides of the axe are plain and expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been hammered. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is complete but has a corroded surface so it is not clear if it was prepared for use or suffered use damage.



The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion.



In general socketed axes are rarer in Somerset than palstaves. The axe appears similar to Savory (1980) no. 200 and 281-9. from Llanberis and Llantwich Major.

The blade is 33 mm long and expands to a width of 20.5 mm, with a bevelled edge that is 3 mm wide at the widest point of the blade. Below the blade on each side of the socket there is a side loop for binding the spearhead to the spear shaft.

The socket is circular in section and has an internal diameter of 14 mm and an external diameter of 18 mm with the collar being 2 mm thick.



The spearhead is classified as a Type 4b plain kite-blade, short (Matt Knight pers comm) following Davis, R. 2012, pp.56-59, and dates from the Acton Park phase, c.1500-1400 BC, of the Middle Bronze Age.

The circular perforation is 3 mm in diameter and 4 mm in from the V-shaped notch above which is 19 mm long and 9 mm wide at the opening. The base of the blades on either side of the tang are slightly concave leading to heel-shaped corners which then curve outwards around the perforation and inwards again towards the notch. The blades are almost semi-circular in plan and are 60 mm long and together they are 54 mm wide towards the base. The tang is 35 mm long and 8 mm wide at the base of the blade and 2.7 mm thick and tapers to 5 mm wide and 2 mm thick at the tip.



This decorated bifid razor is classified as a Type Feltwell (Jockenhövel 1980) and dates from the Late Bronze Age from the Wilburton to the Ewart park phase, c.900-700 BC (Matt Knight pers comm).



Type Feltwell razors are common in Scotland and England, less so in Wales and Ireland. Rare examples can also be found on the Continent (Jockenhövel 1980; Plate 50, Map A).

875082,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete copper-alloy, flanged axehead, dating from the final phase of the Early to the earliest Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000 - 1500 BC). Possibly of Arreton type dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 BC or possibly of a Central European type known as a 'Randleistenbeil' dating to a similar period of time (Huegelgraeber-Bronzezeit Reinecke A/B)



Description: The axehead survives as the blade end and about a third of its original length. It has flanged parallel sides whcih runs along the back of the blades to the tip. The blade itself is a wide crescent shape with upturned corners. There is a very shallow stop ridge, now difficult to discern. Although not complete the flanges appear to narrow towards the body/butt end of the axehead. The axehead's surface is heavily patinated and pitted with some abrasion along the edges and the break is heavily abraded and likely having occured in antiquity.



Measurements: 53.43mm long, 53.05mm wide, 13.18mm thick and 127.8g in weight



Discussion: The superficially seems to fit with the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 415, 422 and 425). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England. 



Similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c. 1750 - 1600 BC.

875083,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Cast copper alloy socketed hammer, rectangular in plan and sub-rectangular in section below the raised collar, with three ribs on either face, that dates from the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC). The mid-rib is more pronounced than those on either side, measuring 3 mm in height. All of the ribs are 5 mm in thickness. There are pronounced casting seams down both sides of the hammer that are 1.5 mm in thickness, suggesting that the hammer was unfinished as these have not been filed down. There is no evidence of it having any side loop. The collar is 5 mm deep and protrudes 3 mm outwards from one face but it is only 3 mm deep and 1.5 mm thick on the oppposite face and uneven around the upper edge. The socket mouth is lozenge-shaped externally in plan and circular internally and is 25 mm wide and 22 mm deep externally and 14 mm in diameter internally. The body of the hammer is slightly waisted and tapers towards the middle and then expands towards the terminal to a flattened but slightly exapnded convex base that is 30 mm wide by 13 mm deep. This working face has been well used with the typical side protuberances from that use.



Socketed hammers became more widespread during the Penard phase (c.1200-950 BC). Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart Park Phase (c.800-700 BC) which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800 BC. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples like this one have collars and moulding.



Whilst hammers are traditionally considered to have a higher tin content in the bronze (Evans 1881) compared to contemporary axes, a large number of records on this database note that based on the weight of the hammers a high lead content is also likely. It is therefore interesting to note that, whilst better preserved and slightly larger than many other examples, this hammer is also heavier than most.



Similar examples can be seen in records WAW-75FD95 and SOM-B048D1 on the database.



The Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website (https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/hammers) comments that the ""socketed hammer is only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976, 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA'.""

875084,Razor,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-600,"Cast copper alloy 'Hallstatt' razor of Type Unterstall or Poiseul (Matt Knight pers comm) that dates from the Lyn Fawr phase of the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, c.800-600 BC. The razor is trapezoidal in plan with two suspension loops above a row of four 'hanging triangles' or triangular openwork. The blade edge is only 2 mm in thickness. There is some damage to each side of the blade where it expands to a pointed apex, now missing. There is a small patch of green corrosion where one of these edges is folded, but apart from that, the razor is in an excellent and stable condition and has a dark brown patina.



Type Unterstall or Poiseul razors have trapezoidal shaped blades, a strengthening rib between the two rings and the blade and have, like Felkirch or Bernissart razors, decorative perforations in the upper part of the blade. However, while the perforations in Feldkirch or Bernissart razors are circular or rectangular, Unterstall or Poiseul razors have triangular ones. Jockenhövel lists their main distribution in southern France, southwest Bavaria and northern Germany, with finds from, for example: Magny-Lambert, Dép. Côte-d'Or and Poiseul-la-Ville-et-La-Perrière, Dép. Côte-d'Or (Jockenhövel 1980, 176-177). He suggests that, in general, their region of origin would have been somewhere in Western Europe where these razors of Type Unterstall or Poiseul, along with razors of Types Felkirch or Bernissart, Endingen and Flörsheim, represented the most typical group of Early Iron Age razors. Jockenhövel's suggested Western European distribution of this type can now be underlined with seven new finds from the southern half of England: Wickham Skeith, Suffolk; St Alban's, Hertfordshire; Salisbury/Netherhampton hoard, Wiltshire; Bowerchalke, Wiltshire; Royston, Cambridgeshire, recorded in LANCUM-DB7650; Attleborough, Norfolk, recorded in NMS-01D7D8, and this example from near Newbury in Berkshire. Early Iron Age razors like these are usually found singly or in hoards, and another individual one has come up recently from Milnthorpe, Cumbria, recorded in LANCUM-220D90 (Dot Boughton pers comm).

Notes:

These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45, BERK-C3E5A3 and BH-AA1CBE.

877085,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"TREASURE CASE : 2017 T1115.



A hoard of six Bronze Age copper-alloy axe heads, found in a stream. Five of the axe heads are socketed axes and one is a relatively rare example of a late palstave from a Ewart Park hoard (although other examples are known from East Yorkshire, see discussion, below). All six of the axe heads date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1000 - 800 BC). Socketed axe specialist Dr Dot Boughton has suggested a very late 9th - early 8th century BC date (pers. comm.).



Note on condition: All axes have suffered the effects of being deposited in water, with patchy green and light brown copper-corrosion and some encrusting. One of the socketed axes (No. 2) was sand-blasted after discovery. This has markedly affected the condition of the axe.



Four of the axe heads are of the Yorkshire type typical of the area. It is possible that some of the Yorkshire types may be from the same mould.



(1) Complete copper-alloy socketed axe head with loop, Yorkshire type. The axe head is wedge-shaped with a square socket mouth of uneven thickness and single mouth-moulding forming a heavy collar. The loop sits below this; it is broadly lozenge-shaped in section and wide in plan, narrowing at the juncture towards the socketed end of the axe head. The cutting edge of the axe head is flared and still sharp. A casting seam is visible externally running longitudinally down both sides of the axe head and down the outer surface of the loop. Further casting seams are apparent running down all four faces internally and a small casting lip protrudes straight up from the middle of the edge of the socket mouth on the wide face (with the loop to the right). Of all the Yorkshire type axe heads within this hoard, this example has survived in the best condition; while there is a large degree of light brown and green copper-alloy corrosion, there are also smooth dark brown patches and the outline of the axe head is clear. The smooth brown surface is marked with shallow scratches and dents. Surface detail has been largely obscured by patches of corrosion at the socket end of the axe head, but three equally spaced ridges can just be made out running longitudinally down from below the socket collar on each face; these apparently terminate before the halfway point although it is not clear exactly where. The interior surface of the socket is covered with lumpy green and white accretions from being deposited in water.



Dimensions:



Length: 83.96mm. Socket Width: 38.03 x 39.35mm. Socket wall thickness: 6.63mm. Blade width: 51.63mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 23.27 x 10.42mm; interior dimensions: 11.16 x 4.36mm. Weight: 226g.



(2) Complete copper-alloy socketed axe head with double-mouth moulding and loop, Yorkshire type. The axe head is wedge-shaped with a ridged sub-rectangular socket mouth of unequal thickness. There is a less prominent ridge running parallel below the socket mouth and three ridges running downwards from this at a right-angle can just be made out. Unfortunately, however, the original surface and much of the detail has been lost due to the axe head being sand-blasted after discovery. This may affect the measurements of the axe head. The surface of the axe head is now a dull grainy light brown. A loop protrudes from the less prominent ridge on one of the narrower faces of the axe head. The loop is broadly D-shaped in section and narrows at mid-point. The cutting edge of the axe head flares. There is a small lip protruding straight up from the long edge of the mouth socket (with the loop on the right), a relic of the casting process. A casting seam is also still visible running longitudinally down both of the narrow faces and down the outer surface of the loop. Sand-blasting has altered the top fifth of the inner surface of the axe head, but the bottom part retains a rough light-green patina from copper-alloy corrosion. There is an irregularly-shaped white stone wedged in the socket from the stream bed.



Dimensions:



Length: 84.03mm. Socket Width: 34.38 x 41.00mm. Socket wall thickness: 6.46mm. Blade width: 49.29mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 18.97 x 6.78, narrowing to 3.95mm; interior dimensions: 9.17 x 6.13mm. Weight: 219g.



(3) Copper-alloy socketed axe head with loop, apparently deliberately crushed. The axe head is broadly sub-rectangular in shape with both of the short ends flaring, but only narrowing at the cutting edge. The socket mouth is now sub-rectangular in shape, with curved corners. The socket mouth is ridged and compression has caused fractures to appear. There is a less prominent ridge below the socket mouth, running parallel with it. A loop protrudes from this ridge to one side; it is broadly lozenge-shaped in section. A casting seam runs longitudinally down both narrow faces and the loop, visible externally. The surface of this axe head is very patchy, mainly rough light brown patches with some smooth dark brown areas and green copper-alloy corrosion. There is slight encrustation due to the deposition of the axe in water. Some of the roughness of the surface is caused from casting flashes that have not been filed away; this may suggest that the axe head was unfinished. The cutting edge of the axe head is bevelled, however, suggesting that it has been subject to sharpening. It is impossible to tell whether sharpening extended to the full length of the blade on both sides on account of the encrusted nature of the axe head.



Dimensions:



Length: 90.56mm. Socket Width: 25.39 x 47.78mm. Socket wall thickness: 6.97mm. Blade width: 52.64mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 20.69 x 8.58mm; interior dimensions: 5.89 x 4.35mm. Weight: 239g.



(4) Complete copper-alloy socketed axe head with loop. The axe head is wedge-shaped with a square ridged socket mouth of uneven thickness. There is a section missing from the ridge at the corner between the wide face and the face with the loop (with the loop to the right). This probably occurred during manufacture. The loop is wide and rectangular in section, narrowing very slightly at the juncture towards the socket mouth. There is a casting seam visible running longitudinally down the opposite face and a seam running longitudinally between the socket mouth ridge and the loop, but not below it. The cutting edge of the axe head flares and is slightly notched. Within the socket is a sandy concretion of organic matter and white stone from the stream bed. Small white mineral deposits have also formed accretions on the exterior surface. Otherwise, the axe head has a rough light brown surface with light green patches of copper-corrosion and smooth dark brown patches.



Dimensions:



Length: 82.21mm. Socket Width: 37.85 x 38.32mm. Socket wall thickness: 7.54mm. Blade width: 51.83mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 20.43 x 9.98mm; interior dimensions: 9.54 x 4.29mm. Weight: 218g.



(5) Complete copper-alloy faceted axe head of the Meldreth type. The axe head is long and slender with a convex cutting edge that flares and curves round into two sharp points. At the other end is a trumpet-shaped collar at the socket mouth. A ridge with central groove runs around the edge of the square-shaped socket mouth. The other side of the trumpet collar is demarcated by a parallel, although less prominent, ridge. There are four facets on each side of the blade. A loop projects to the side from the bottom of the trumpet collar; this is broadly lozenge-shaped in section with a casting seam running longitudinally down the middle of both sides. The casting seam on the outer side extends to the length of the axe head, with a matching seam on the opposite side of the axe head. These are not apparent internally. View of the socket is obscured by stone and organic detriment built up from the stream. Casting flashes remain on the outer surface of the axe head, giving it a bumpy outline. Otherwise, the axe head has a rough light brown patina with some smooth dark brown patches and areas of light green copper-alloy corrosion.



Dimensions:



Length: 105.75mm. Socket Width: 32.54 x 36.41mm. Socket wall thickness: 7.32mm. Blade width: 54.04mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 23.70 x 7.57mm; interior dimensions: 7.57 x 4.98mm. Weight: 227g.



(6) Complete copper-alloy palstave with loop. The palstave belongs to the Late Palstave group (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 158-64), and can be placed within Type Isleham (Ibid., 161-2). The palstave is broadly rectangular in profile, widening towards the cutting edge. It is lozenge-shaped when viewed from the side, tapering to the sharp cutting edge and narrowing at the opposite end to a squared butt. It has a rectangular septum with a curved depression in the middle of the short outer edge that forms the butt end; the septum separates the straight-sided open flanges on either side which flare out from a point below the butt end to a stop ridge, forming the widest part of the lozenge-section. The flange on the side of the loop (when the loop is to the left) is missing a section, leaving a rectangular gap. The loop similarly protrudes from the widest point of the lozenge; the loop is pentagonal in section, having a wide, shallow ridge running longitudinally down the outer face and a sharper casting ridge running longitudinally down the inner face. Three ribs extend longitudinally down from the stop ridge on the two wider faces. The palstave has a rough patchy patina, with light brown and green corrosion and smooth dark brown patches. Stony white accretions from the water have built up in the juncture between the flanges and the septum and sandy organic material has built up in the loop.



Dimensions:



Length: 142.49mm. Length of blade (from cutting edge to stop ridge): 83.91mm. Blade width: 37.53mm. Length of septum: 52.87mm. Width of septum: 23.40mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 24.77 x 9.80mm; interior dimensions: 12.16 x 4.99mm. Weight: 382g.



Discussion:



This hoard is notable for containing a range of axe types dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 - 800 BC) (cf. Rohl & Needham 1998, 105-6). Some are very common in Northern England (e.g. Yorkshire types: Nos. 1 and 2, above) while others have stronger affinities with the south of England (e.g. Everthorpe and South-Eastern types: Nos. 3-5, above). The palstave axehead (No. 6, above) is a notable addition to a small number of late palstaves from Northern England (see Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 158-64; Burgess 1968, 14, f.n. 60). In this respect the hoard can be compared to the Sproutley hoard, East Riding, which contained a late palstave (of type Worthing) along with South-Eastern, Yorkshire and Everthorpe (and other) type socketed axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pl. 66). The large hoards from Driffield, East Riding (Treasure cases 2016 T239 & 2016 T240), also contained a similar mixture of socketed axe types, although they did not include any late palstaves (see Huisman & Haldenby 2018 for full discussion). In short this hoard is consistent with what we know of depositional practices and hoard composition during the latest centuries of the Bronze Age in East Yorkshire (c.1000 - 800 BC).



It is interesting that one of the axe heads seems to have been deliberately damaged prior to deposition. While the stream in which these axe heads were found appears to be modern, it may follow the route of an original gully. A nearby road name contains the name 'mire' and the area looks to be on the margins of a small island which sits above an area of carr/moss. It seems, therefore, that these axe heads were deposited within the context of a liminal boundary between wet and dry land, potentially on the very edge of the wetland or within a stream which runs seasonally (Peter Reavill, pers. com.).



Conclusion: 



The hoard qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 regarding prehistoric metalwork assemblages.

It seems to fit into Davis's Group 2 (2017). It has a triangular blade with ribs on each blade wing, and a prominent midrib, lozenge shaped in cross-section. The socket is circular in cross-section and the socket extends just into the base of the blade midrib. There is a side loop on each side of the socket, positioned very close to the end of the object, away from the blade. The spear head is 124.5mm long, 30.4mm wide and 20.6mm thick. It weighs 103.49gm. The internal diameter of the socket is 15.5mm. It has a smooth golden brown patina with only slight pitting and corrosion.



Davis (2017) notes that ""Spearheads from the earlier MBA were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket. They date to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC."" He describes his Group 2: ""Early socketed"" as ""Triangular blade.

877224,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Cast copper alloy unlooped palstave axe probably dating to the Middle Bronze Age palstave 1500 to 1150BC. The axe shares similarities with the Taunton metalwork assemblage and Hotham related to the palstaves of the Acton Park metalwork assemblage to which it bears some resemblance similar to Needham et al fig 140 (1985) and Read (1995: p.3 fig 9 ) Dated to 1200 BC. The axe is almost complete and is relatively long with a length of 150mm. The butt is slightly concave and has a width of 30mm. The flanges are flat, longiform in plan, straight and parallel as far as the stop but do not extend all the way to the butt, with a width at the stop of 30mm. The blade is flaring 72mm wide with a slightly bevelled facet possibly as a result of hammering. The septum is very small and hard to discern and the edge of the butt maybe slightly broken. The axe has a green patina with green colouration in patches and there are various nicks along the length The axe is 30mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.

The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops or midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group II type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC.

Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.

The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches

Only a small section remains with a part of the original edge and very worn irregular breaks on the other sides. The section of the outside edge is too small to idenify the complete diameter. The ingot is pitted likely due to a mix of impurities in its matrix and the uneven natural material used to create the bowl in which it was cast.

An undated copper alloy object, a fragment of casting debris (a casting jet) from metal working. The object is cone-shaped with a deep well in the centre and a thick stubby runner beneath, which would have flowed into the mould. The runner has several incised lines around it that may be tooling marks from when the jet was detatched from the mould, or may indeed be evidence of the tool working on the mould itself. The casting jet has a light green patina with much blackened material across and around it. Although it is not possible to identify the period with certainty, the patina suggests this casting jet is probably Bronze Age in date.

877566,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead blade with a larger, heavy blade which suggests it was produced during the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. The asymmetric casting with a misaligned core has caused one socket wall (11 mm thick) to be much thicker than the other (4 mm thick). This does not appear to have prevented the axehead from having been prepared and used. The socketed axe appears to have been deliberately broken in antiquity, most likely while hot from recent experimental research (Matt Knight pers comm). The blade has broken off below the socketed body of the axe where any decoration, probably in the form of longitudinal parallel ribs, would have terminated. There is a deep longitudinal groove on one face but this is more recent damage since deposition. The end of the socket is internally 28 mm long, 7 mm wide and 20 mm deep.



See CORN-37D710 for an axehead from the St Buryan hoard with a similar slightly expanded blade and three parallel ribs on each face with is part of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage, dating from c.950-850 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example from St. Erth, that is in Penzance Museum, on page 565, plate 4, no.43a, which is classified as a Stogursey-type socketed axe, but is also referred to as a South Wales type, but without the complete axehead, it cannot be classified.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-10-27T23:00:00Z,2017-11-05T00:00:00Z,,,144.65,,,19,50,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Deviock,SX3355,Generated from computer mapping software,50.37113783,-4.34975321,CORN-E91A21,,DSCN5968.JPG,socketed axe blade (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN5968.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/645054.jpg
877584,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead with a square socket and the remains of a side loop and decorated with three converging moulded ribs on both faces, dating from the Late Bronze Age. The axehead is missing most of its collar and only has two stubs where the integral side loop would have joined them together. The surface is corroded and pitted with patches of light green oxidisation, but most of the dark green surface patina remains on the blade. The longest surviving rib on the face of the axe is 56 mm long and 3 mm wide. The axehead is slender in form and bears features that are most directly comparable with the South Welsh type, such as the three converging ribs, square socket and side loop descending from the collar moulding, which date from the Ewart Park metalwork phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. However, the axe most closely conforms with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981, 173-175) Gwithian type. This type is based on a mould for a slender socketed axe found in the occupation layers at Gwithian, Cornwall (Burgess 1976; Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 174). In the same occupational layer, two Continental bronze pins were also found, which broadly date to the Penard phase of the British Bronze Age (c.1300-1100 BC) (Needham 1981, 34). Thus Gwithian-type axes might predate the typical South Welsh type socketed axes from the Ewart Park phase and could date to the Penard or possible Wilburton phase (1300-1000 BC). Due to the uncertainty around dating these axes, it is perhaps best to give a broad date from 1200-800 BC, which equates to the Middle-Late Bronze Age in Britain. Other Gwithian type axes are known as single finds such as from near Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales (Burgess 1976, 71), and Sedgemoor and Loxton Hill, both Somerset (Pearce 1983, Nos. 673 and 678) (Matt Knight pers comm).



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar socketed axehead with parallel sides, a sub-rectangular section and three converging ribs on each face, from Kingsbridge in Devon, on page 95, pl.15, no.139.

The circular socketed end is broken and partly missing, with an internal diameter of 13 mm at the broken edge, and the cutting edge is worn, partly through use, with its orginal surface missing. The gouge tapers in profile from the open end to a point at the cutting edge which is curved into a semi-circle so that it can gouge out sections of wood or other materials. The surface is corroded and pitted but most of the original patina remains on both sides of the gouge. Socketed gouges are first seen in the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The blade is trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the broken edge. The blade was originally crescentic with expanded pointed terminals but has been worn to rounded terminals. The blade narrows towards the broken end, which is below where the transverse stop ridge would have been, stopping the haft or handle from sliding down the blade when the axe was being used. The blade is too corroded and pitted to see if there was any decoration at the narrower broken end between the flanges.



Flanged axes with crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig.28, no.89).

The axe head has lost part of the socket and some of the body from the aperture towards the point. The apeture is sub rectangular where it can be seen. The blade of the axe has a very slight curve at both sides, and is 39.79mm wide,  and 27.42mm wide above the socket. The aperture measures 18.98 by 23.81mm. On both the front and reverse of the axe is a single rib. The body is slightly facetted towards the edges and both sides are sub triangular in shape: the apex of the triangle is at the point of the blade. As well as the structural damage to the axe there is some minor damage, wear and corrosion whether due to age more recent damage cannot be determined. Much of the original surface is missing.

Based on comparison with a similar axe in Schmidt & Burgess (1981, pl. 89, no. 1369) the axae discusssed above is of the Yorkshire type, and dates to the Late Bronze Age (c.900-800BC). Yorkshire  Type axes have a wide distribution through East Anglia and northwards into central Sotland (Ibid, p223). The type was well represented in both the Bowes Moor hoards (DUR-308251 and DUR-1F5057).

Running down from the hatching can be found a lozenge shaped undrilled loop, one either side, measuring about 22mm in length and 16.67mm in width. They sit approximately in the middle of the spearhead, between the blade and the open socket mouth. As the loops are undrilled, it is difficult to say how they could have been used to help attach the wooden shaft to the spearhead, or whether they were used as suspension loops for tassels or other forms of decorations.

880152,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-300,"~~An incomplete copper alloy moustache-like object probably dating from the Middle Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age (1500-300 BC).

This has a hollow bulbous body one end of which narrows to a fine point giving an overall tear drop shape. To the side of the wider end is a hole 9mm long by 5mm wide. The wider body of the object has fine latitudinal lines the run around its circumference with only the pointed tip remaining undecorated.


These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples such as this item while others are 'double' see YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45 and BH-AA1CBE.



In the case of double examples there is normally an open area at the centre of the object suggesting it was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-05-31T23:00:00Z,2017-11-01T00:00:00Z,,,4.08,,,10,22,1,Kurt Adams,Kurt Adams,South West,Somerset,South Somerset,Barwick,ST5614,From finder,50.92376814,-2.62738266,GLO-3F7F09,,GLO3F7F09.jpg,GLO-3F7F09 Bronze Age moustache-like object,Bristol City Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO3F7F09.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/644927.jpg

882082,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An almost complete cast copper alloy, socketed spearhead of Davis Group 13, dating from the Late Bronze Age. The spearhead can be described as a pegged leaf-shaped socketed spearhead with lanceolet blade and circular sectioned mid-rib. It dates from c. BC 1000 - BC 800.



The spearhead has an elongated leaf-shaped blade, the edges of which are bevelled and still sharp. The very tip of the blade is damaged. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib. The midrib expands towards the base to form the socket, the socket has an internal diameter of 20.6 mm and the wall is 2.1 mm thick. Mid-way down the socket there are opposing circular peg holes, (measuring 5.4 mm in diameter). The blade is broadly leaf or flame shaped in plan, and in section the wings are triangular. The cutting edge is present and is bevelled. There doesn't appear to be evidence of use or sharpening on the surface. The wings taper in at the base towards the peg holes. There is a modern break situated about half way up the blade, and a piece missing from here on the reverse of the object. There is a triangular groove above the peg holes on the front face of the socket.



The tip part measures 86.3 mm in length and is 29.7 mm wide at base and 4.7 mm wide at tip. It has a thickness of 9.2 mm and weighs 41.0 g.



The socket part measures 117.5 mm in length and is 31.1 mm wide at top and 26.3 mm wide at base. It has a thickness of 14.5 mm and weighs 84.0 g.



The total length of the object is 196 mm. The maximum width is 31.3 mm and the maximum thickness is 14.5 mm. The total weight of the spear is 125.1 g.



The object is a mid green in colour with an uneven, but mostly shiny green patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail and some damage to the object. This object probably corresponds with examples from metal working phase I or II of the Late Bronze Age.

882163,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1250,-750,"2018 T111; Undergoing Valuation



Description: A Late Bronze Age gold penannular ring, dating to the period 1150-750 BC. It measures 16.02mm in diameter at its widest point and 14.67mm at its most narrow, making it slightly oval. It is 4.59mm thick and weighs 4.72g. It narrows towards the terminals to 3.95mm. The gap between the terminals measures 1.9mm.



Discussion and Date: The Penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Egan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange' (Mark Lodwick and Mary Davis in record NMGW-04216C; references therein). Similar examples to this object are found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database including: DUR-EC189D, HAMP-F7B741, YORYM-0DD2F7.



Consequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

The fragment comprises a small portion of the blade and the tang. The blade is missing its tip but is lentoidal in section. The edges of the blade are either missing or heavily corroded. The tang extends from the blade and is approximately trapezoidal in plan. The remains of a hemispherical section rib are visible on both the upper and lower surfaces of the tang. The fragment measures 49mm in length, a maximum of 25mm in width and a maximum of 7mm in thickness.



Two small fragments of copper-alloy waste/slag were found at the same findspot. They measure:



a) 22mm in length, 16mm in width, 8mm in thickness and weighing 7.4g.



b) 23mm in length, 21mm in width, 8mm in thickness and weighing 7.86g.



The dagger is similar to BH-2DF409 and LANCUM-EDDE97 which both date from 1300 to 1150BC. This fragment with its pronounced midrib resembles both daggers and might therefore belong to the Penard phase, too, dating to the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age 1300-1150 BC.

The axe has a broad head, tapering to a narrow butt. There is no evidence of flanges or ridges along the sides of either face but it is heavily corroded. This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe appears to be undecorated. The length is 77mm, width 37mm, thickness 10mm, and the weight 25.54g.

The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.

It probably can be assigned to Davis's Group 6 'Developed side looped' type (Davis 2017). It has a narrow blade measuring 45 mm in length. The tip is missing and the break is very worn and patinated suggesting it broke in antiquity. Only circa 12-15 mm of the tip appears to be missing. The blade wings are highly abraded and irregular, though much of this appears to have occurred post-deposition since the breaks are a different patina to the rest of the object. A maximum width of 7mm remains of the the blade wings. There is a hollow cylindrical socket at the blade base. The base of the socket is incomplete, and no side loops are visible.

The palstave is rectangular in shape with a central stop ridge which is worn on both sides. In cross section from the top the axehead is H shaped. After the stop ridge the axehead flares out to form a wide curved blade which measures 72.9mm in width. In profile the blade is triangular and narrows to a sharp edge. There are a couple of small breaks and notches in the blade edge. In cross section from the side the axehead is composed of two ovals. On both sides there is a irregular casting seem running the length of the axehead. The axehead is similar to the shield-patterned pastaves from Acton, however there is no 'shield shaped' impression below the stop ridge.



The axhead is dark brown with orange and green patches. There are circular holes, both large and small, on both sides from casting. The axehead measures 165mm in length, 26.2mm in width across the body, and weighs 434g.

The axe has expanding, straight sides, curving into the cutting edge. At this point there is a slight imitative stop ridge on both faces. The flanges are low (c.1mm high), extending from below the butt end and tapering out as the sides curve into the cutting edge. The butt end is narrow and thin (6.3x0.9mm) with a slight convex curve and possibly a small area of damage at one corner. The cutting edge has a more pronounced curve, is 14.8mm wide and 0.8mm thick at the very edge. In profile, the object is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval. The max. thickness is at the centre of the object, where it is 3.8mm thick. The sides expand to 10.7mm before curving into the cutting edge. There are vertical scratch marks along the body of the axe on both faces.

The object measures 49.2mm in length, 14.8mm in max.width, 3.8mm in max.thickness and weighs 7.91g.



This object is clearly modelled on the low-flanged axe, characteristic of the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage. Arreton types date to metalworking stage VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 4 circa 1750-1550 BC. It is uncertain whether this is a miniature axe intended for use (it seems rather small for axe-purpose) or perhaps had use as a votive object; it is larger though in its miniature form similar to miniature socketed axes (for eg.HAMP-657353) thought to have an amulet or votive function and believed to date between the Bronze Age to the Roman period (Robinson, P; 1995).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.91,,,3.8,49.2,1,Jordan Gamble,Jordan Gamble,South East,Hampshire,Test Valley,Nether Wallop,SU3238,Generated from computer mapping software,51.14037943,-1.54397191,HAMP-B3BE22,,HAMPB3BE22.jpg,Bronze Age - Roman miniature object,Hampshire Cultural Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPB3BE22.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/647169.jpg

The awl tapers in plan from the rounded spatulated end which is 14.6 mm wide, and sub-rectangular in section, to the pointed end which is 3 mm wide and circular in section. The awl is heavily patinated and has taken a lot of damage around the nib leaving it distorted and with several deep cuts across its surface. Some awls may have been hafted in to a wooden or bone handle and this flattened butt end may have made for better hafting. Plain copper-alloy awls are hard to date precisely, but ones of this form are known to have been introduced in the Bronze Age with most being later Middle to Late Bronze Age in date c.1150-800 BC. The form changes little throughout time, however, and post-Bronze Age examples are also known.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar awl with a chisel-like opposite end from Tarrant Rushton in Dorset on page 103, pl.30, no.314, recorded in DOR-6DF7F6 and dated from the Middle to Late Bronze Age, c.1500-800 BC.



Similar examples have been recorded on the PAS database, including SF-333182 from Suffolk, SWYOR-55A4B7 from Yorkshire, and WILT-97977D from Wiltshire.","From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments.

The axe-chisel is near-complete but is heavily corroded with some damage to the blade and butt and is comparatively small (with a length of 46.7mm and a weight of 22.0g). The butt is straight and flat with a little damage (12mm wide and 2mm thick). The sides are near-straight and divergent for the entire length of the axe-chisel, reaching the maximum width at the blade (of 26.4mm and with a thickness of 1.5mm). Much of the original blade edge is lost, which is of curved form but was not recurved. Both faces are very gently convex across their lengths but reach a maximum thickness (of 5.7mm) approximately one-third of its length from the butt (15mm from the butt) and is near-flat across their widths. There is no discernible median bevel or blade facets, although the blade faces converge more sharply (beginning 9mm from the blade edge). The side has a lenticular profile and there are no 'developed' features evident on the axe-chisel. The original surface has nearly all been lost with small remnant patches evident on both faces with a mid-green patina, elsewhere the pitted surface has corroded bright-green to green brown.","Early Bronze Age axe-chisel implements are difficult to relate to established axe typologies with any confidence. This example has no 'developed' features, perhaps indicating an early date of the bronze implements from the Early Bronze Age but also possibly because of a restricted casting technology and limited subsequent working. It could be suggested that the axe displays features more similar to Needham's Type 2 axes with a lenticular profile, comparatively wide butt and straight sides (perhaps 2C /D), although visual examination suggests a bronze rather than copper metallurgy. It is possible to suggest therefore that the axe may belong to Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,22,,,2,46.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Eirini Anagnostou,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Longtown,SO3430,GPS (from the finder),51.96454255,-2.9620237,NMGW-0670CA,,201619.jpg,Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe-chisel,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/eanagnostou/201619.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/646959.jpg

The socketed axe is complete (with a length of 100.6mm and a weight of 277.1g). The top of the mouth is flat (with external dimensions of 54.5mm x 41.7mm and internal dimensions of 33.6mm x 27.8mm) and the remnants of the four casting stubs are evident, positioned near the inner edge of the mouth. The socket is sub-rectangular and appears to retain some sediment (at a depth of 66mm). Beneath the mouth the collar is short (7mm - 8mm) and bevelled to the faces, somewhat rounded in areas. The arched loop (37mm long 12mm high externally and 16.9mm x 6.5mm internally) springs from the base of the collar moulding and is of D-shaped section (5mm wide and 4mm thick). The sides are near-straight, very gently concave (with a minimum body width of 41.7mm) before diverging a little more sharply at the blade. The casting seam is evident on both faces and is now corroded but was raised and carefully finished. The sides are bevelled towards the seam, producing a sub-hexagonal body profile. The blade edge has a slight expansion (with a blade width of 48.0mm) and is moderately rounded. Both faces are straight along their lengths before a subtle but discernible blade facet (27mm from the blade edge) and have a slight convexity across their widths. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, which are near-parallel on one face but convergent on the other. The ribs (52mm - 61mm long) descend from the collar moulding and end before the blade facet. Much of the surface has been lost on the blade but a fragment of original surface survives showing sharpening striations running along the blade.

The cutting edge is heavily abraded, as is the surface of the blade so not sure whether it is symmetrical or asymmetrical through use. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. There are no traces of a casting seam but this may be due to corrosion.



The palstave, on both faces, has a prominent straight stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. There are no hollows or ribs before the stop-ridge. The flange sides are a sub oval in profile with a flattened surface along the centre which was probably due to the removal of a casting seam.



In plan the septrum is rectangular and the butt has an abraded edge. The flange tops lean inwards over the septrum forming a convex exterior surface of the flange. 



The palstave has a well-developed brown patina which is incomplete and abraded. 



The palstave measures 155.16mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 61.33mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 27.81mm thick across the apex of the flanges. It weighs 466g.

Description: The chisel has a wide flat crescent shaped blade at the end of a long cylindrical body. The blade heavily abraded. The socket end has an oval aperture 10.57mm by 7.97mm. Each edge has a pair of opposed diagonal lines incised on them, creating a feathered decorative affect. One of the thin edges has the feathering go all the way up to the blade while the other stops before the blade begins to fan out. A fifth line exists as a second collar prior to the collared socket. Despite some minor verdis gris around the abrasion on the blade edge the chisel remains in excellent condition albeit in a dull dark brown colour.

Discussion: Dr. Dot Boughton observes that while this chisel superficially looks like a socketed axe is rather an unlooped woodworking tool. She continues, that it is likely of LBA, Ewart Park (c.10th-8th centuries BC) as shown by the herring bone decoration which is mirrored on some specimens early Iron Age Sompting type axes but not on LBA examples, and it is much better executed than on EIA axes. we could make a case for this being transitional, ie LBA-EIA, 9th-8th century.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,21.21,,,15.91,53.08,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Maidstone,Lenham,TQ9051,From a paper map,51.22656114,0.7197557,KENT-9E799C,,KENT9E799C.jpg,Bronze Age Socketed Chisel,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT9E799C.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1000777.jpg

The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade. Two rivet holes to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, both of which still retains its rivet; the rivet is 11.5mm long with a 7.4mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The sides of the blade are straight and gradually taper to the point, running down the length of the blade on both sides is a very low central spine. Post depositional corrosion has resulted in shallow notches being removed from the side of the blade but otherwise this item is in very good condition with a light brown patina over most of the artefact.

Dirks, dagegrs and rapiers of this style are classified as the Wessex Culture (c.1800-1400 BC) by Read 2001, 76, no 625, fig 53 and as belonging to Group 2 in Burgess, C., and Gerloff, S. 1981, 'The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland'.

888599,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A nearly complete cast copper-alloy socketed side-looped spearhead of early Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1550-1250BC. Acton Park I-II Type, (Needham Period 5) - Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. Davis Group 5, wide blade side looped.



The spearhead comprises a leaf shaped blade with chamfered edges and a conical socket with protruding, semi-circular side loops; one to either side of the socket which are positioned in line with the cutting edge of the blade. A protruding mid-rib is present to both surfaces of the blade where the socket tapers to the tip. The edges of the blade are worn with a small semi-circular break to the lower curved edge of one side. Slight casting flashes are visible to either side of the loop though have been removed and smoothed down along the socket. Two small worn circular perforations are present on the socket, one to either side midway between the blade and loops. It is possible that the spearhead's stability has been reinforced with the addition of pegholes. Pegged varieties were not exclusive to the Late Bronze Age; as Davis (2017) notes in discussing the early socketed groups, some 'may have peg holes'. A slight bend in the blade is present which may be the result of purposeful decommissioning of the object though may also be a result of depositional processes.



The metal has a dark brown patina, delaminated with powdery green patches in places. The spearhead is 125.2mm long; the blade is 36.8mm x 4.3mm; the socket is 22.1mm in diameter, 2.7mm thick, 73.4mm depth. The object weighs 89g.



Side-looped spearheads correspond to Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV which date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,89,,22.1,4.3,125.2,1,Rebecca Griffiths,Rebecca Griffiths,Yorkshire and the Humber,East Riding of Yorkshire,East Riding of Yorkshire,Watton,TA0449,GPS (from the finder),53.92669734,-0.41766702,YORYM-2D7578,,ATF0001.jpg,Bronze Age : Spear,York Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/ATF0001.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1003835.jpg

The blade tapers in thickness to the edge with no edge bevel. The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow, squared butt end. The flanges start a short way in from the butt corners and form a pointed oval shape in profile with the crest of the flange being the widest point. The exterior surfaces of the flanges are slightly concaved and no casting lines are visible. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body. There is no obvious stop ridge for the handle to butt against although there is a not very pronounced curved stop on the main body just above the lower end of the wings. The blade is thicker than the septum and tapers in thickness to the crescent shaped blade with no edge bevel. The edge of the blade is slightly chipped on one side.



The axehead is undecorated and the metal has a brownish-green patina, with bronze showing in patches, on some edges and the blade.



It is 110.5mm long, 44.2mm wide at the blade, 18.9mm wide at the butt end, 35.1mm thick at flanges and 13.67mm at the middle and weighs 197g.

The axehead is broadly rectangular, with an incomplete expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt is narrow and incomplete and measures 21.8mm in width and is 3.8mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than having cast flanges. The flanges extend 1.0 mm above the body of the axe head. The expanded blade measures 39.6mm in width and is 2.5 mm thick at the break.



The axehead measures 85.4mm in length, has a maximum width of 39.6mm (blade), a minimum width 21.8mm (butt), and has a width of 28.3mm in the centre. It is 10.8mm thick at the central point. It weighs 118.1g



The axehead is green, with a corroded and pitted surface.



This axehead is similar to those WMID-F20D62 and is consistent with that of the Arreton type axe, of Early Bronze Age III dating, metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.

892106,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy flanged chisel of Middle Bronze Age date.



Description: It has a long rectangular blade original tapering to a curved splayed cutting edge. The blade however is broken bfore this point and is very worn. The butt end is flat and rectangular in form with prominent flanges to either side and transverse stop ridges on both front and back faces. Although this butt end is snapped a short way along the flanges and remains roughly jagged. Beneath the stop ridges the front and back faces have moulded shield-shaped decorative elements shown in counter-relief. No clear casting seam is visible down either side although this maybe due to the haeavy verdi gris corrosion. The one part of the edge visible appears to indicate some level of finishing. The surface of the chisel is heavily pitted in across much of its surface with a heavily verdigris presence. There is also substantial ware and the breaks are ragged.



Measurements: 114.63mm long, 20.72mm wide at the stop ridge, 15.22mm thick (at the flanges, 5.43mm thick at thinnest) and 115.55g in weight.



Discussion: This is a flanged chisel of Middle Bronze Age date. Similar examples are noted by Rowlands (1976: pp. 44-45, form iii, pl. 34 no. 1132), who notes that flanged chisels with shield shaped mouldings have a typological relationship with flanged axes and palstaves and are particularly concentrated in East Anglia ( a number of recent discovereies of palstaves with shield shaped mouldings in Kent may indicate a SW North-Sea zone for these types), as well as northern France. This dates the chisel to the Middle Bronze Age, c.1500-1150 BC. A more complete example from suffolk can be seen at SF-09D1D5.



Peter Reavill, FLO for Shropshire and Herefordshire comments further that ""this form of relative rare flanged (palstave-like) chisel are most probably aligned with the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II) c. 1500-1300 BC. The overall form of these chisels is very similar to the early palstaves albeit being much more slender. If this arguement is taken then they are probably contemporary to the primary phase palstaves, Group I which has a shield shaped or trident decoration directly below the fused stop ridge on the upper part of the blade. Theses palstave axe fits best with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. Although the construction / casting date fits within this period - it is highly probable that such specific and useful tools had a long life and so their deposition could potentially be many generations after casting (i.e. deposited in the period 1000-800 BC)"".",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,115.55,,,15.22,114.63,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Canterbury,Littlebourne,TR2058,GPS (from the finder),51.27864492,1.15305937,KENT-D5F626,,KENTD5F626.jpg,bronze age flanged chisel,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTD5F626.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1004628.jpg
892326,Palstave,Bronze Age,Neolithic,BRONZE AGE,1500,1150,"Middle Bronze Age copper alloy unlooped palstave dating to the period c. 1500 - 1150 BC. 



It has an expanded lenticular profile with faint traces of filed down longitudinal casting seams. The butt is slightly concave, possibly as a result of post-depositional damage. It exhibits a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The transverse stop ridge expands on both faces and forms the widest point of the palstave. Below, on both faces is a vertical rib which extends to the central point of the upper cutting edge. The blade has expanding sides and a convex cutting edge, now heavily worn. 



The palstave has a mottled dark grey patina largely obscured by green corrosion product and pitting. 



Early Midribbed Palstaves belongs to the Acton Park Phase II of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. This example is similar to Group II - Early Midribbed Type Chepstow; similar to an example from Kilnoterie, Scotland (p127 cat no 794 plate 58, No. 789).

892715,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1250,"A complete copper-alloy early phase palstave dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500-1300 BC): The blade of the palstave is sub-trapezoidal in plan with slightly concave sides, flared blade tips, and no side loop. The cutting edge is slightly abraded on one edge although this appears to cut through the patina suggesting post-depositional damage. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The stop ridge has a small hole before it on one side, a probable casting flaw. There is a slight midrib down the centre of the blade on either side.



This palstave is particualrly similar to examples illustrated by Rowlands (1976: plate 29) all categoristed as his type 2 (side flanged) form dating to c. 1400-1150 cal BC. There are also good parallels illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981: plate 58) which correspond to their Group 2 (early Mid ribbed).

892882,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Early - Middle Bronze Age copper alloy flanged axehead of Needham's (1983) Type 5a dating to the period c. 1700 - 1500 BC. It exhibits a narrow butt (23mm in width, 3mm in thickness). The body is slender and expands along its length to a width of 51.8mm. The sides exhibit high, inward-curved flanges forming a lenticular profile (maximum thickness 20.5mm, tapering to 12.5mm at the top of the blade). Most of the surface is now heavily corroded and pitted, however, one flage retains traces of decoration in the form of a series of punched chevrons. It is probable that this decoration originally covered the extent of both flanges.



The blade expands obliquely from either side of the axehead at the point the flanges terminate, forming a crescentic cuttring edge (width: 97.5mm). This has been somewhat aberaded and is now obscured somewhat by corrosion product.



It has a curved bevel or ridge about halfway down the septum (c.52mm from the butt), which is marginally lower than the flanges, but indicates the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. This is clearer on the better preserved face of the axehead. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion.
