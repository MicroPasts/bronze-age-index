403105,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1020,-800,"Two halves of a Late Bronze Age Copper alloy axe mould (Type Welby). Although both moulds fit together well and their interiors match, the exteriors have different protrusion patterns.



1a. The back-face of a copper alloy axe mould (Type Welby) extensively coated in dried earth (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3). The visible areas of metal are a matte red/brown on the outside and dark grey/green on the inside. The mould exterior has two rectangular protrusions 7.6mm in length positioned centrally close to the socket end between two 84mm long lines of circular protrusions. These are 2.7mm in diameter and spaced between 7mm and 8.7mm apart.



The interior of the mould contains semi-circular, double- mouthed axe recesses above three rib indentations with the loop recess developing from the lower mouth. The coating of dried mud makes it difficult to ascertain the length of the rib recesses beyond 30mm. Max length: 139mm; max. width: 61mm; impression area length: 113mm; impression area width at blade: 45mm; impression area width at loop: 43mm; impression area width at mouth: 34mm: impression area maximum depth at mouth: 19.7mm; weight 245.1g 1b. Front-face of a copper alloy axe mould (Type Welby) with large areas of the red, brown metal still covered in dried earth (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3). The exterior surface is damaged in the centre at the socket end above two rectangular protrusions 7.6mm in length. These are positioned centrally between two, 91mm long lines of circular protrusions. These are 2.7mm in diameter and spaced between 7mm and 8.7mm apart. Another circular rivet is centred between the lines close to the blade end of the mould. The visible interior of the mould is a mirror image of 1a (above) containing semi circular, double mouthed axe recesses with the loop recess developing from the lower mouth. A thick coating of dried earth obliterates the view of the rib and blade area. Max length: 145mm; max. width: 63mm; impression area length: 113mm; impression area width at blade: 45mm; impression area width at loop: 44.2mm; impression area width at mouth: 38.7mm: impression area maximum depth at mouth :19.7mm; weight 279.1g","Part of the Rothley Hoard other items can be found at LEIC-A67B11 LEIC-A665D7 and LEIC-4F6B02



The copper alloy axe moulds are for the manufacture of Type Welby socketed axes as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, 221-3) and date to the EwartPark period (1020-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age (Needham et al. 1997). Their discovery location in Leicestershire is approximately ten miles west of the Welby hoard find site described by Smith (1957, 24, fig.4). Such axe moulds are rare but this can be compared to the mould from Roseberry Topping, Yorkshire (Type Sompting) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 243),It is possible that the copper alloy socketed axe of the Welby Type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, 205) may have been made in this mould though until further cleaning there is no way of evaluating this any further.

405511,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1250,-975,"Cast copper alloy fragment of a dagger, shield-shaped in plan, plano-convex in profile and triangular in section, with a worn central mid-rib, tapering towards the tip of the dagger. The point end of the blade is rounded and the opposite edge broken off so that the rest of the blade and hilt, which would have all been cast as one piece, are missing. The sides of the blade come to a point and are slightly bevelled. The pronounced central ridge running up and down the length of the blade, rounded but not flattened in section, resembles the daggers and swords from the Penard (c.1250-1125 BC) and Wilburton (c.1125-975 BC) phases of the Bronze Age. But the mid-rib is only on one side of the blade which suggests that this is a fragment from a dagger blade, and more likely to date from the Penard phase, when daggers have been found associated with Ballintober swords.











Pearce (1985) illustrates a small sword with Ballintober associations on page 602, Plate 41, No.314a from Washfield in Devon which is dated to the Penard phase.

406303,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An almost intact cast bronze / copper alloy socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 800 BC).


The axe is almost complete (95%), with only a few chips missing from the edge of the blade. The original edge of the blade is not present so it is hard to determine how the blade extended outwards.


The axe is sub rectangular in plan, with the edge of the cutting edge appears to expand / flare outwards to form an convex cutting edge. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is relatively poorly preserved. The socket is sub square in cross section, with a circular opening (internal diameter 31.23mm, external width 42.78mm). The socket has been emptied out of the soil to reveal a square shaped void extending the majority of the length of the axe. The external edge of the socket is flaring out to form a ridge around the mouth of the socket. The edges of the blade are faceted, with elegant proportioned edges that expand from the expanded blade to the socket. The lower edge exhibits a semi circular moulded side loop (25.65mm length, 11.55mm wide, 4.60mm thick and projects 9.65mm away from the surface of the axe), in parallel alignment to the blade. On both sides of the blade, there are a large number of fine diagonal and horizontal striations, indicating the final finishing and preparing of the blade. A casting seam (central raised ridge) runs the length of the axe from the socket mouth to the side of the blade. The opposing edge to the loop exhibits another casting seam (central raised ridge) running the length of the blade. These casting seams are the result of the mould being used to cast the axe being made originally in two halves. The two sides of the mould are slightly misaligned, indicating that the mould has slipped slightly during the casting process. The casting seams have been hammered, filed and smoothed. Four casting jets are present along the edge of the socket, and have been filed and smoothed off. These two sides are both sub triangular in plan with the apex of the triangular being the point of the blade.


The other two sides are sub rectangular in plan, with three parallel vertical ribs present approximately a third of the way along the axe from the socket, extending from a horizontal rib, parallel to the socket. These ribs are about 4.7mm wide and extend approximately 26.7 mm down the length of the axe. They start 18.75 mm away from the mouth of the socket. A low ridge runs around the axe at the top of these ribs.


The axe measures 105.66mm in length, 42.94mm wide, 45.65mm high at the socket and 46.42mm at the edge of the blade. The metal is 7.40mm thick. It weighs 332 grams.


The axe has a even dark green smooth patina covering it. Around the top of the axe, the surface is a dark almost black colour, which is normally typical of South Wales type axes, however this Axe is more typical of the Bredon Hill type (North Wales type). There are a couple of areas of active corrosion (bright green powdery areas), mainly located on the edge of the blade and in a couple of small sections on the socket. Within the socket, some of the soil has been impregnated with copper corrosion products. These areas need careful observation to ensure that active corrosion does not cause any more problems. Advice from a trained conservator should be sought.


This axe fits within the socketed and faceted axe typology; specifically into the division type Meldreth which is broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age. It is associated with the later phases of the Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and earlier phases of the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-800 CAL. BC. Broadly these forms of faceted axes have a distribution on the Eastern side of Britain and suggest a southern British metalworking tradition (cf Schmidt & Burgess).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-07-30T23:00:00Z,,,,332,45.65,,7.4,105.66,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,East Staffordshire,Wootton,SK1145,From finder,53.002208,-1.837536,WAW-F69CD5,,WAW-F69CD5_9.jpg,Late Bronze Age: Socketed Axe,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WAW-F69CD5_9.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/297501.jpg

407843,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A cast copper-alloy axehead of late Bronze Age date (circa 1000-800 BC). The axhead is complete and suffers minimal damage. Where damage it occurs it is chiefly along the blade, although there are some other scuff marks elswhere. The uneven patina along much of the blade suggests that some of this damage occurred whilst the object was in the ground.



The axehead measures 109.2 mm long and 41.3 mm wide. It weighs 261.5 grams. It tapers from 41 mm thick at the socketed end to 2 mm thick at the blade. The axe is hollow, with a socket for attachment of a haft. The socket is sub-rectangular in shape and measures 41 mm by 41 mm. The axehead is waisted, tapering slightly from the socket to the centre, and then flaring again to the blade. A raised collar runs around the axehead at approximately 15 mm from the socket. On each side four decorative ribs emanate from this collar, running for approximately 33 mm in the direction of the blade. On one edge, situated just after the collar, there is a semi-circular moulded attachment loop. On each edge there is a casting seam which runs down the length of the axe.



The axehead has a fairly even dark green patina with patches of paler green copper corrosion in places. This axe fits within the socketed and faceted axe typology; specifically into the division type Meldreth which is broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age. It is associated with the later phases of the Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and earlier phases of the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII).

He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly. The mid rib is D-shaped in section on one face and triangular in section on the other, probably as a result of a slight deformity in the casting mould. The spearhead has a dark green patina.

The socket is broken just below the base of the blade wings in a diagonal break that appears quite deliberate. The socket extends c. 28.3mm into the fragment. The midrib is more rounded on one side of the blade and has a more obvious ridge on the other. At the break to the blade a lozengiform cross-section is revealed, with the midrib section continuing in tapering flat triangles to each side. The bevel to the outside edges of the blade is c. 3.0mm. Naturally the loops are adjacent to the midrib, but almost seem like an afterthought rather than an integral feature. They are formed within a heavily scored area extending c. 30mm up the blade from the socket/blade junction. The perforations forming the loops begin between around 8 and 12mm up from the junction respectively. They are thin and oval. On the outer edge there is no integral loop plate. The unusual characteristics of this spearhead make its attribution as a basal-looped type tentative, although an example illustrated in Savory (1980, 175; ref. 232) is comparable.

The cutting edge is expanded and worn but apparently undamaged. Both faces are pitted and the shorter looks 'caved in' at the edge - conducive with a hammer blow. All breaks are old.


The socket is rectangular in cross-section, and the fragment itself triangular in cross-section.


While the axehead is rather small, it is difficult to say whether or not it is 'votive'. It may have just had a use as a small axehead. However the probable hammer blow could well be ritualistic - although it could equally represent the scrapping of metal, the hoards of which are so prevalent during the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC).

421182,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1150,"A cast copper-alloy palstave of middle Bronze Age date. The axe is in reasonable condition, although there is damage to the butt, some of which is missing, and other scuff marks on the blade and body of the axe. The palstave is fairly short and chunky with maximum dimensions of 96.86 mm long, 43.39 mm wide, 24.06 mm thick and 200.5 grams in weight. A U shaped flange is situated at the butt end of the axe, terminating in a stop ridge at the palstave's thickest point. On both sides, immediately after the stop ridge there are angled grooves which form a 'shield' or lozenge shaped central rib which continues in a subtle way down the blade of the axe after the grooves finish. The blade is slightly faceted and is crescent shaped in plan, triangular in profile. The axe has a dark grey patina with areas of green corrosion where it has been damaged, particularly on one edge, the blade and at the butt and septum, though it is pock marked with corrosion at many points.



The palstave has its closest parallel illustrated in Schmidt and Burgess (1981: pl. 61. no.833) which is a defined as a group 3 low flanged palstave dating to c. 1400-1150 cal BC. No exact parallels are illustrated by Rowlands (1976: pl. 86 hoard 73 item 5) although he considers recessed decoration similar in form to be a developed shield pattern found on Class 1 group 5 palstaves found typically in Hampshire. it is appropriate to suggest that this therefore fits within the larger developed shield pattern group within this study thought to also date to c, 1400-1150 cal BC.

422831,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A heavily abraded cast bronze un-looped palstave with central rib below the stop ridge and raised flange facets of Middle Bronze Age dating (1500 - 1100 BC).











The palstave measures 148.24mm in length, maximum surviving blade width is 52.95mm, socket width is 27.37mm and it is 23.41mm thick. It weighs 357 grams.


The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a probable convex blade edge. The cutting edge has been lost. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being in front of  the stop ridge. The surviving blade length (measured from the blade edge to the stop ridge) is 82.62mm,  and the surviving width of blade edge is 52.95mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 5.01mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 14.60mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 29.89mm). Beneath the stop-ridge, on one side of the palstave, is a tapering central raised rib. This rib extends approximately half way down the length of the blade, the point of termination has been lost through abrasion. The surface on the other side has been lost through abrasion, it is possible that a shield shaped motif was present. The convex cutting edge of the blade is lost through corrosion, abrasion and probably wear. The exposed edge is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This may be due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion. 


The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 63.60mm long, 21.24mm wide and 6.20mm thick. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The width at the butt is 23.94mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe are similar to each other, however one side retains more of the original surface. Two air bubbles, or casting flaws, are present on the more abraded side.


The palstave is a light - mid green colour with areas of thick well formed patina and exposed areas of abraded metal. It is likely that abrasion and corrosion has spread and affected 40% of the surface of the axe. However, this corrosion seems to be relatively stable at present and relatively few areas of light green active powdery corrosion can be observed, mainly along the blade edge. These areas should be monitored to ensure that further active corrosion does not occur. The septum has retained the majority of the original surface patina, unlike more exposed areas, where it has flaked off due to abrasion.











This form and style of palstave fits into the Acton Park metal working tradition which is dated to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC, Needham's Period 5 (1500 - 1150 BC) (Needham, 1996, pp133). Several comparative examples of this type of palstave have been published. These consist of  #797, a Type Coed Llan related example from Yorkshire (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, pp128); #650 from Bardon Hill, Leicestershire (Rowlands, 1976, pp315); #153 from St Fagans, Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, pp104) and #155 from Llanfedw, Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, pp105). Three similar examples have been recorded on the PAS database from Staffordshire (LVPL-3EFEA7 from Biddulph; WMID-AC04C7 from Cheadle; WMID-262202 from King's Bromley).

423415,Sickle,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"A copper alloy socket from a Bronze Age Sickle. The socket is conical with a rounded end and the mouth is complete with a slightly bevelled edge. There is an irregular hole in one side of the socket. The start of a blade with curved ribs projects to one side and points downwards. The ribs are on both faces and are matched. The object is broken across the blade. It has a well developed mottled green patina.



According to Fox's 1939 paper in The Prehistoric Society Journal, socketed sickles can have lateral or vertical sockets. This one is laterally socketed (which seems to be more common), but is a little more unusual in have ins closed top to the socket, but with the blade hardly projecting over the top of the socket. This example is most similar to Fox's suggested phases of development 4 or 5, and the ridged decoration on the blade seems similar to sickles believed to have developed in Ireland. Fox suggests that the earliest sickles developed in the lowlands of the UK, then spreading to Ireland and the Highland zones. The main distribution in 1939 was in South Wales, East Anglia, Ireland and Eastern Scotland, with a notable scarcity of examples from the Midlands and Northern England.



The sickle has some similarities with two sickles in Evans's Bronze Age implement corpus (1881). He illustrates two ribbed examples; fig 236 Near Errol, Perthshire and 237 Garvagh, Derry, page 200. The former is the most similar (Peter Reavill pers comm). These sickles are better known in Ireland and East Anglia and are comparatively rare elsewhere (Laura McLean pers comm). There is also an example in Devizes Museum (Katie Hinds pers comm).

433217,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"A complete, but concreted, Middle Bronze Age cast copper-alloy palstave axehead from the Acton Park (phase 2) or Taunton phases, probably Taunton (c. 1500 - c. 1150 BC). It is unlooped with high, curved flanges (max. H.: 26.9mm), fused to the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) measures 70.3mm by c. 16mm. The width at the butt is 19.45mm. The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum height of c. 9.6mm above the septum. The stop ridge is stands c. 6mm above the septum. There is a shield shaped moulding beyond the stop ridge, and fused to it, on both faces (c. 19.5 by 18.0mm). This is bisected by a moulding ridge (seam) running the length of the axehead on both faces (including the septum); this starts on the lower blade and terminates before the butt. Each side of the ridge, within the shield, are two moulded longitudinal decorative ridges (forming a slight trident). There are further longitudinal ridges (casting seams) central on the sides; these have been finished by trimming the casting flash and hammering. The blade is 52.7mm across, with an edge bevel c. 9mm long (but obscured by accretions).  The object has suffered mild corrosion, and slight abrasions to one of the flanges. Where it survives the patina is dark brown; the metal is generally a mid-brown colour, slightly reddish. Spread all over the palstave are orange concretions presumably from local iron deposits.



The palstave fits into Rowlands' Class 1, developed shield pattern Group 2 palstaves; many developed shield pattern palstaves have been found in the Southampton area (ibid., 29), perhaps in emulation of what is generally an East Anglian form. This form of axehead fits within the corpus from the later Middle Bronze Age (MBA II), of metalworking tradition phase VIII / IX, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 5 1500-1150CAL. BC. It fits best within the Taunton metalworking tradition although has elements common with those seen with the second phase of the Acton Park tradition. The Rowlands distribution of these is useful, but as his corpus was produced in 1976 it does not include more recent Middle Bronze Age finds which might refine it. A similarly decorated shield can be seen on a palstave from Bottisham, Cambs, illustrated in Rowlands (1976, 293/Plate 27; ref. 339). There are many examples of palstaves with cast ribs on the septum, however the majority of these are grouped in threes rather than singly as on this example; a good parallel can be seen on a palstave from a hoard of 14 from Quex Park, Birchington, Hertfordshire (ibid., 246/Plate 10; ref. 10). This hoard seems to have been contained within a globular 'Deveral Rimbury style' urn.","

433341,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of uncertain type and probably of Ewart Park metalworking industry dated to 950 - 750BC (Needham 1996).



The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 42.32mm and a weight of 87.4g). The axe is of sub-hexagonal section at the break (with a width of 44.3mm and a thickness of 9.7mm). One face of the axe is considerably thicker than the other (4.8mm compared to 2.9mm) because of misalignment of the core during casting, which may have caused weaknesses in the axe. The sides are moderately straight to concave for the short surviving section before diverging to the blade edge. The casting seams are discernible on the sides and appear to have been hammer-finished. The blade edge has been lost but was curved (with a surviving width of 47.3mm). The socket of the axe is now closed and both faces are concave across their widths, indicating that the axes faces were crushed. Both faces also display numerous battering marks and the thinner face has torn through the battering. Sharpening striations are evident running along the blade. The surface has a dark green patina where it survives and is pale green elsewhere.



Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC although most recovered socketed axes are of EwartPark phase. The axe may have been of South Wales (Stogursey) type although the blade is comparatively broad for the type.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2009-03-11T00:00:00Z,,,,87.4,,,,42.32,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Bridgend,Bridgend,Pencoed,SS9480,,51.508954,-3.528785,NMGW-A4F441,,2009.140.1.jpg,Socketed Axehead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.140.1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/320344.jpg
433463,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1900,"A cast copper-alloy axehead of early Bronze Age date. The axehead is incomplete, missing the end of the butt. It is of late Migdale metalworking tradition, dating to Stage III of the early Bronze Age, spanning Needham's Period 2, c. 2,300 to 2,050 BC and the beginning of Period 3, c. 2050 to 1700 BC (Needham 1996, 127 - 130). The axehead suffers from damage to the tip and edges of the blade. This is probably post-depositional, as the patina on the breaks differs from that of the undamaged parts of the axe. The same can probably be said of the damage at the butt, although the damage here does not appear to have occurred very recently. Although damaged, the blade is convex in shape and the sides of the axe are slightly convex, tapering towards the butt and flaring towards the blade. There are very slight ridges at either edge of the face on both sides. A ridge also runs down each edge of the axe, making it pointed lozenge shaped in section. The axe tapers gradually in thickness from 9.99 mm at the broken butt end to 3.63 mm at the blade. Both faces exhibit faint longitudinal markings which run from the broken butt to the tip of the blade.  On other examples these are decorative rather than evidence for sharpening, as they appear to be cast and sometimes terminate before the blade (see DENO-93FB17 for example, on this database). These are probably also decorative on this example. Striations, probably caused by sharpening, are also visible on the blade. 











The axehead measures 119.5 mm in length, 32.6 mm wide at the broken point of the butt and 89 mm wide at the widest part of the blade. It weighs 331.3 grams. It has a dark brown patina with considerable evidence for wear. There are areas of green bronze corrosion at the tip of the blade and the break at the butt, as well in small areas of the face. The axehead probably dates to between 2100 and 1900 BC,",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-11-01T00:00:00Z,2010-11-30T00:00:00Z,,,331.3,,,9.99,119.5,1,Tom Brindle,Tom Brindle,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Hamstall Ridware,SK1118,Generated from computer mapping software,52.759497,-1.838439,WMID-DCC172,,WMID-DCC172.jpg,Early Bronze Age copper-alloy flat axe,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-DCC172.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/320418.jpg
435317,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1500,400,"Copper alloy (bronze) casting waste of uncertain date; most probably Mid - Late Bronze Age (1500-700 BC). However, due to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from Bronze Age - Roman period (c. 1500 BC - 450 AD). This fragment is from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould. The casting waste is conical; being oval in plan and D shaped in cross section. In profile the edges of the waste taper relatively evenly. The base of the casting waste is irregular with the remains (nipples) of two runners / casting jets being present. These jets / runners are heavily abraded. The sides show no evidence of casting seams although they are also similarly abraded. The upper surface is pitted and rough, although heavily patinated: at the centre of the upper surface is a slight depression. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. The casting waste is a mid green colour with an abraded and corroded patina that covers all surfaces. Casting waste is very hard to date in isolation but the patina and form might suggest a Bronze Age - Roman date. The fact that this mould comes to an oval broken edge may suggest that it was for casting a palstave or possibly a tool; it is most likely to date from the Middle Bronze Age. A direct comparison has not been found. The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.

435732,Palstave,Bronze Age,,,,,"Denuded copper alloy unlooped palstave in two fragments, found some years ago in the top of a mound (GAT PRN 26156) at the above NGR whilst using a metal detector. 
 
The palstave has a flaring blade, although the cutting edge is no longer present and one tip is missing. The rounded stop-ridge is well-defined and a clear individual mid-rib runs from the stop-ridge towards the cutting edge of the blade (the terminus of the rib is unclear due to surface corrosion). Both features are extant on either side of the palstave, but are heavily eroded on one face only. The butt has also suffered significant damage from corrosion.
 
The palstave was cast-in-one and the total length would have been c. 145-50mm. The blade is sub-oval shape in cross-section with a protrusion in the centre of each face where the mid-rib runs across the surface. 
 
The fracture does not appear fresh, although it is unclear whether the item was found in two separate pieces or whether the break has occurred since its discovery. The surface appears to have been cleaned with an abrasive item such as wire wool, although a dark grey patina remains in places. The majority of the surface is pitted with green-tinged depressions and the palstave appears to have developed a defined waist as a result of corrosion c. 20mm from the stop-ridge.
 
The palstave appears to belong to the Acton Park industry, which emerged in north Wales at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. Although fine detail is difficult to discern on this item, it bears similarities to unlooped palstaves found at Holyhead Mountain, Ynys Môn; Fron-hir, Llanbister, Radnorshire; and those from Acton, Denbigh.

437304,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-2150,410,"A fragment of copper alloy, probable casting waste, possibly of Bronze Age dating (2150 BC to 800 BC). However, due to the lack of context and continuation of casting styles, this fragment could be dated from the Bronze Age through to the Roman Period (c.2150 BC - 410 AD).



The fragment is sub triangular in plan, and roughly D shaped in cross section. It has an irregular, rough surface. It is most likely part of a copper ingot, prior to being smelted and cast. It is a mid to dark green colour. A couple of small areas of iron staining, probably due to impurities in the copper. An even patina covers the surface.


It measures 43.87mm in length, 24.86mm wide and 12.81mm thick. It weighs 36.8 grams.




In appearance, the fragment does display some similarities to a barbed and tanged arrowhead shape. However arrowheads made from copper alloy are incredibly rare and tend to be almost flat in profile, it is highly improbable that this fragment is a Bronze Age arrowhead. Due to the weight and appearance of the fragment, it is more likely that it is a small piece of a copper ingot, produced from the smelting of the copper ore, in preparation for casting.

442844,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1250,-100,"A cast copper alloy 'moustache' shaped object of uncertain use. The object is three-dimensional and consists of a pair of drooping ovoid elements with pointed tips, hence 'moustache' shaped. These ovoids are decorated with multiple grooves running down the body of each ovoid but stopping before the tip. In the centre of the two drooping ovoids is a recessed band running around the waist of the object. On the underside is a rectangular hole; it appears that this hole may have continued through and perforated the top but this has been filled at some point with a small amount of copper alloy. 


The use and date of these objects remains enigmatic. A number of these have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database, including WMID-CA9D04, BH-037A57 and SF-520513. There is some variation in these objects, some have very pronounced but slimmer ovoids with long tips, others are short and squat. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117), and as such they are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age, but without stratified examples this is unconfirmed. It is possible that these objects may have been dagger fittings, with the hole a rest for the tang, but again without any evidence this is speculation.

445530,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed Hammer of Bronze Age dating.


The socketed hammer is rectangular in plan and cross section, and cuboid in shape. Each face exhibits a panel of ridged decoration at the top, and U shaped recess at the base. Casting ridges are present down each side, and have been smoothed off. The tip has been bevelled. At the base of the socket, some white residue or possibly clay soil remnants are present.


The socketed hammer is in good condition, with an even surface patina. It is a dark green colour. There are a couple of areas of more recent plough damage.


The hammer measures 57.01mm in length, 24.57mm wide and 22.53mm thick. The socket is 38.31mm deep and the thickness of the metal around the socket is 3.80mm. It weighs 97.4 grams.


Comment from Brendan O'Connor: This hammer has a ribbed collar and a bipartite body. It looks as if the  upper, socketed part of the body is distinguished from the solid 'business end'  of the hammer. The short surviving  length of this presumably solid portion suggests the hammer was well used.   


Comment from Dot Broughton (Cumbria FLO): They date from 1000-800BC and are, like Peter says, usually found in LBA hoards  (e.g. Bunwell, Norfolk). There's a socketed hammer from the Scottish  hoard at Adabrock. They  are usually found with Ewart Park sword fragments, South Eastern socketed axes,  Meldreth Type socketed and other faceted axes and an arrangement of various  chisels and other tools, etc. I think it's the hoard from Carleton Rd, Norwich,  Norfolk that is probably the best example for LBA tools (though there's not  socketed hammer in that hoard!). There are a couple of stray finds on the  database - like LBA axes and chisels, most of them are from hoards, but some are  stray finds. 


Comment from Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO): Inventaria Archaeologica Hawkes 1956, and the hammer is similar in overall shape - with the stepped mouth to an example in the Isle of Harty hoard (GB.18.3.3.22) although the base does not narrow and taper like yours. The moulding of the grooves can be seen in an example from the Reach Fen Hoard, Cambs GB.17.3.3.24 which I think is the best parallel. I can see nothing in Evans - agree with dates and associations that Dot provides - an odd one for Yorkshire


Comment from Terence Manby: Finds of Bronze hammers, apart from doubtful fragments, are know from two Yorkshire hoards -  Kilnhurst, near Rotherham, crude plain examples (GB. 41.5 & 6; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, Pl. 138 B 2 & 5) and Roseberry Topping, near Stokesley, plain collar and thicken rim (Schmidt & Burgess 1981. Pl. 148 D 6).       The multiple ridged collar may be comparable with the ridged collars of the Type Fulford socketed axes - Wallington Industry - that are not at all common across Yorkshire and Northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981. 176-7).","

The socketed gouge is near-complete, with some peripheral damage around the mouth and blade (with a surviving length of 77.2mm and a weight of 50.5g). The mouth is circular (with a diameter of 20.5mm) with no mouth mouldings. The gouge flares outwards slightly to the mouth (with a diameter beneath the mouth of 18mm). Beneath the flaring mouth, the sides of the gouge are straight and slightly convergent (producing a blade width of 15.4mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been carefully finished, probably by hammering. The blade comprises a shallow U-shaped depression (beginning 43mm from the current blade edge), which is filled with prominent striations running along the channel from top to bottom. The striations are unlikely to be purely from sharpening and possibly are partly decorative. The blade edge has been lost but does not appear to be expanded. There is a groove running diagonally from the mouth to the side of the blade, which has appears to have some patination internally, suggesting that it may be damage from antiquity or a possibly a flaw in the mould. The surface has a dark green patina where it survives and elsewhere is pale green. The colour of the patina has been altered by a recent oily coating by the finder.

449307,Spear,Bronze Age,,,-1500,-750,"Bronze Age bronze socketed spearhead, of pegged type and of Greenwell and Brewis' (1909, 458-460)  Type V. Class V spear heads are ascribed to the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding with Needham's (1996)  Periods 6 and 7, dated to 1150 - 750BC.

The spearhead is complete (with a length of 113.8mm and a weight of 67.3g). The socket is near circular (with an external diameter at the mouth of 23.5-24.1mm, an internal diameter of 18mm and a thickness of 2.6mm). The sides of the socket are straight and convergent. The shaft was attached through two circular rivet holes (3.3 and 3.6mm diameter, positioned 11-12mm from the mouth). The blade is flame shaped, where the blade is convex to its widest point (with a width of 29.2mm) and is then slightly concave to the tip. Blade facets are evident on both sides and faces (1.6mm from the edge) and no sharpening striations are discernible. The blades are slightly thicker against the socket (with a thickness of 3mm) and thin towards the edge (with a thickness of 1mm before the blade facet). The socket continues as a prominent and wide midrib to the tip.

The spearhead has applied decoration around the socket, beneath the start of the blade. The decoration comprises four bands of liner striations flanked on each side by repeating chevrons or small punched triangles and undecorated strips (2-3mm wide) separate the decorative bands. Beneath the blade is a border of small punched triangles above 6-7 linear striations (with a width of 1.8mm). At the base of the striations is a double-incised zigzag or line of adjoining chevrons. After a plain strip, the three motifs are repeated but the linear striations are interrupted by the two rivet holes. Punched triangles border the rivet holes on the top and bottom and beneath each rivet hole are triple incised opposing chevrons, within the 'undecorated' strip. A further band of linear striations is flanked on its lower side by punched triangles, with no further motif above. The basal band of striations is flanked on its upper side only with repeating chevrons. The decoration has been finely incised and carefully applied. 

The golden bronze surface survives over much of the lower part of the spearhead. A dark grey to brown corrosion is adhering to the surface elsewhere. The socket has mostly been cleaned out but remnant traces, of possibly wood survive.


Socketed and riveted (Class V) spearheads have been recorded from Wales,  such as the example from the Llantwit Major hoard in the Vale of  Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, p 121, no. 281.14) . Decorated spearheads have  also been recorded, for example at Guilsfield in Powys one of the  spearheads has punched dot decoration around the socket and base of the  blade (Savory, 1980, p 118, no. 268.18). The Swansea Bay spearhead can  be closely paralleled with an example found in the River Thames at  Staines and now in the Museum of London collections , published by  Needham et al (1987) . The Staines spearhead is also of socketed,  riveted type with a flame blade and also has applied decoration  encircling the socket mouth, comprising five bands of striations with no  chevrons or punched decoration. The Staines spearhead was radiocarbon  dated from wood surviving in the shaft and produced a date of 1100BC -  840BC (with a 95% probability). As early as 1909 (Greenwell &  Brewis, p 470) noted the use of vertical and horizontal lines, zigzags  and triangle motifs on arrowheads of looped and riveted types. It is  possible to suggest that the liner incised decoration on both examples  may be referencing binding on earlier, looped spearheads.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2009-06-25T23:00:00Z,,,,67.3,,,,113.8,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,Swansea,Swansea,,,,,,PUBLIC-0919A7,,2009.235.1i.jpg,Bronze Age socketed spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2009.235.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/333605.jpg

The pin is complete (with a distorted length of 237mm, a straightened length of approximately 270mm and a weight of 32.7g). The head has a slightly oval mouth (13.4mm - 14.3mm external diameter, 12mm internal diameter and 3mm deep). The sides of the cup-head are straight and parallel before curving sharply to the shaft. The interior of the cup-head contains no discernible decoration and is filled with corrosion. The pin shaft is of circular section and has a prominent swelling beneath the head (positioned 20mm beneath the head and producing a maximum diameter of 7.8mm). Beneath the swelling, there appears to be a slight rounded lug on one side of the shaft (8mm long, 2mm thick and 2mm high). The shaft gradually thins to the comparatively wide tip. No applied decoration is evident on the pin. The surface is mostly encrusted with sand and shell, and elsewhere has a grey brown surface.


The pin has been problematic to date due to the lack of cultural affinities, however, Eogan (1974, p 98-101)  has stated that Cup-headed pins are   characteristic of Late Bronze Age Ireland. The size of the head of this   example, may be seen as comparatively small, where Irish examples vary   from 16-27mm (ibid) but the length of the shaft is comparatively   massive. Cup-headed pins have a sparse distribution in Britain with only   three recorded examples by O'Connor (1980, p 560) , with the Swansea   pin representing the furthest west example recovered in mainland   Britain.

450104,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1000,"Bronze Age bronze blade, probably of Middle Bronze Age date



The blade is incomplete, with some peripheral damage and distortion (with a distorted surviving length of 66.3mm and a weight of 13.3g). The hilt had straight and parallel or near-parallel sides (with a width of 21.1mm) and the top edges are angled to meet at the centre. The two rivet holes were circular (with a diameter of 4.5mm) and one is open at the side. The hilt is thinnest at the butt and thickens at a point above the rivet holes, where the midrib is discernible as a ridge. The midrib widens beneath the rivet holes and produces a maximum thickness at the top of the blade (of 3.8mm). The better preserved side suggests that there is a step from the hilt to the blade edge (where the blade has a width of 18.0mm). The blade edges were probably straight or near-straight and converge towards the break. The midrib narrows slightly towards the break and is very slightly convex across its width on the blade, with the blade facets being gently concave. The blade is thinner at the break or tip (at 1.5mm). Much of the damage to the blade edge is likely to be post-depositional but it is possible that some of the notches may have resulted from use or deliberate damage. The surface has a dark-green to brown patina with areas of pale green corrosion. There are no discernible sharpening striations on the blade.


It is possible that the blade is an eroded dirk, although it would be comparatively small and the hilt arrangement is a little unusual. It is also possible that the blade has been reworked from a larger dirk or rapier. Dirks are present throughout the Middle Bronze Age, with the earliest examples of Acton Park metalwork, dated from c. 1600-1400BC and continue through to Willburton metalworking dated to c. 1150-1000BC, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Periods 5 - 6. This example is more likely to date from the later part of the suggested range.","Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefacts was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The objects were examined whole within the specimen chamber and were analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion. 

Three separate readings were taken and the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable with other results the average compositions were: 81-89 % copper, 8-12 % tin, 1-2 % antimony and less than 1 % lead. The comparatively high level of antimony, if correct is unusual and may suggest a date later than the early Bronze Age. Comparable levels of antinomy have been found in Later metal work, such as in a number of items in the Guilsfield Hoard, characterised as Wilberton metalwork. All of the Early Bronze age daggers published by Gerloff (1975, p 167-8) have lower levels of antimony. However, the very low levels of lead would be unusual in Late Bronze Age metalwork.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-16T23:00:00Z,2010-07-06T23:00:00Z,,,13.3,,,,66.3,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Holt,ST8561,,51.3478791,-2.21676275,PUBLIC-4425B2,,2010.1i.jpg,middle bronze age blade,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334224.jpg

The palstave is incomplete and is fragmentary, missing the butt and broken near the stop (with a surviving length of 133.4mm and a weight of 343.2g). The palstave has broken before the butt (where it has a width of 21.9mm, a thickness at the septum of 6.5mm and a flange height of 13.1mm). The septum has a U-shaped profile before the rounded stop. The flanges (with a maximum height of 27.7mm) are not as deep as the stop height (at 30.6mm high) but may have suffered some damage. The tops of the flanges have a fairly linear convergence towards the butt. The sides of the palstave are straight as far as the blade, before gradually widening to the damaged blade tips. The casting flashes are evident on both sides and have been finished, probably by hammering but remain prominent, particularly along the sides of the blade. There are unusual mouldings running across both sides, corresponding with the position of the stops. The maximum blade thickness (at 22mm) is less than the stop height, defining a bar ledge stop. The flanges do not continue as ribs along the edges of the blade faces. The original blade edge and the tips have been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 55.0mm) and the blade edge has a moderate curve. A blade facet is discernible on both faces (up to 10mm from the damaged blade edge). The blade face is decorated with a sunken shield pattern and a midrib; the midrib does not continue into the shield as seen on the three-pronged trident' decoration. Angled striations running off the blade edge may be the result of sharpening. The palstave surface has a dark green patina where it survives and elsewhere is pitted and pale green.

450238,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"Early Bronze Age developed flat axe, probably of miniature form or possibly of Type Bandon, Variant Swinton, dating from Metalwork Assemblage IV, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 3, dated to 2050 - 1700BC

The axe appears to be complete (with a length of 58.5mm and a weight of 22.4g). The butt is rounded (with a width of 11mm) and the axe is of sub-rectangular section. The axe has discernible median bevels on both faces (28mm from the blade). The sides are near-parallel as far as the median bevel (where the axe has a width of 13.3mm and has a maximum thickness of 6.5mm). From the bevel, the sides are straight and divergent to the blade edge. The blade edge is moderately curved (with a width of 16.9mm) and no blade facet is now discernible, there are no flanges evident on the axe. Very little of the original surface survives with a dark brown patina; elsewhere the surface is pitted and is pale to mid green.


The axe is of a diminutive size, even for Type Bandon, Variant Swinton and it remains unclear whether the axe had a practical purpose or was votive. It is possible that the 'axe' may have been used for delicate tasks, perhaps similar to a chisel. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is two-thirds of the size of these axes, it may have been used for a similar function.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-22T23:00:00Z,2010-07-14T23:00:00Z,,,22.4,,,,58.5,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Dorstone,SO3142,,52.07204898,-3.00810352,PUBLIC-494006,,2010.4.2i.jpg,Early Bronze Age developed flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.4.2i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334326.jpg
450246,Axe,Bronze Age,,,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe, of uncertain type and probably of Ewart Park Metalworking Assemblage, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950 - 750BC.

 


The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 38.1mm and a weight of 134.2g). The axe has broken near the base of the socket (with a length of 29.0mm, a surviving width of 7mm and a maximum surviving depth of 9mm). The axe is of rectangular section at the break, with convex sides across their thicknesses (where the axe has a width of 49mm and a maximum thickness of 20.3mm). The casting flashes are clear and raised on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The sides curve-out sharply to produce an expanded, recurved edge, although one of the blade tips has been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 70.1mm). The blade faces are convex across both their lengths and width with no discernible blade facets. There are no ribs extending onto the blade fragment and no discernible sharpening striations on the blade edge. There are deep scratches of random direction on both faces which appear to have patinated, suggesting they may have occurred in antiquity. The surface has a dark brown patination.


The blade fragment appears to be from a comparatively substantial axe, although the fragmentary nature makes the typological identification difficult. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although most recovered socketed axes are of Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-15T23:00:00Z,,,,134.2,,,,38.1,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Wenvoe,ST0870,,51.4215187,-3.32451035,PUBLIC-496574,,2010.5.1i.jpg,late bronze age socketed axe fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.5.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334328.jpg

The axe is fragmentary, broken in antiquity around the approximate mid-section with the blade end represented. The fragment suggests a comparatively small axe (with a surviving length of 47.7mm and a weight of 53.6g). The socket is sub-oval with straight, parallel ends (with a length of 27.0mm, a surviving width of 14.1mm and a maximum surviving depth of 32.8mm). The axe has a sub-hexagonal body section at the break (with a width at the break of 33.5mm and a maximum surviving thickness of 18.8mm). The casting flashes are evident and raised on both sides and appear to have been roughly finished by hammering. The sides are near parallel and only diverge slightly to the eroded blade tips (producing a surviving blade width of 38.2mm). The original blade edge does not survive and is comparatively straight. The blade faces are slightly convex across their widths and flat (but convergent) across their lengths with prominent blade facets discernible on both faces (c. 13mm from the present blade edge). There are now no ribs extending onto the blade fragment, although the surface loss on the upper part of the fragment may have irradiated the lower parts of any ribs. No sharpening striations are discernible on the blade edge where the surface survives. Some of the original surface survives with a dark brown patination, elsewhere there are areas of active bronze corrosion.


The blade fragment appears to be from a comparatively small axe, although the fragmentary nature makes the typological identification difficult. The hexagonal body section and crude finishing may suggest an axe of South Wales Type. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although this axe is likely to date to the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-29T23:00:00Z,,,,53.6,,,,47.7,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,Torfaen,Torfaen,Ponthir,ST3294,,51.640673,-2.984055,PUBLIC-9BD5E6,,2010.26.1i.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.26.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334949.jpg

The end of the circular socket is present at the break (where it has a surviving depth of 17.6mm and an internal diameter at the break of 7.0mm). The socket continues along the blade as a prominent and rounded midrib (giving a maximum surviving thickness of 9.2mm at the break), which gradually narrows and thins towards the tip.

Description



Ingot, fragment. Plano-convex edge fragment with rounded outer edge. Length: 74.5mm, Width: 62.5mm, Thickness: c.31mm



Ingot, fragment. Plano-convex. Length: 92.5mm, Width: 90mm, Thickness: c. 32mm.



Discussion



These ingot fragments probably belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, dating to c.1000-800 BC. Both fragments are plano-convex, being rounded on one side and flat on the other. Ingots such as these were cast in a dish-shaped mould, and are often referred to as 'bun' ingots due to their shape. Ingots of raw metal were transported and traded throughout Britain and Europe during the Late Bronze Age. They were frequently broken up into fragments, ready to be smelted to make a range of bronze weaponry, tools and ornaments. Ingots (and ingot fragments) are a regular feature of LBA hoard deposits in southern England (cf. Turner 2010, 86-7). Numerous plano-convex ingot fragments have been recovered in Devon and the surrounding regions (e.g. Powell 2005a; 2005b), most notably the copper and tin ingots recovered from a probable shipwreck site off the coast of Salcombe (Roberts & Veysey 2011; Needham et al. forthcoming). Scientific analysis is currently being undertaken on the Salcombe finds at the British Museum (B. Roberts pers comm.). The Paignton finds are therefore significant for their potential (subject to future analysis) to reveal information regarding patterns of trade and exchange in the Late Bronze Age period in South-West of Britain.



Conclusion



As these two Late Bronze Age ingots were found within 1.5m of each other, they are most likely to originate from a single deposit, which has been dispersed. This material is eligible as Treasure under the Treasure Order (2002), as it is a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects.

The oval shaped mouth (36.79x30.07mm) is a single, outward-projecting moulding max.7.11mm thick from which extend ?4 vertical ribs on one face. The other face is badly damaged but at least 2 ribs are visible. At the edges of the axehead the casting flashes are visible, but have been worn down a little. On one of these sides a loop extends 25mm from the mouth moulding.


The damage is worn but probably not ancient. It could well have been casued by plough damage. Interestingly the damage is consistent with a large blow on one side, which is sometimes attributed to contemporary ritual destruction of the obect.

The axe is complete (with a length of 155.3mm and a weight of 507.3g). The butt is moderately rounded and thin (with a width of 38.4mm and a thickness of 3mm). The sides are concave, narrowing to a point near the butt (with a width of 36.1mm and 35mm from the butt), before gradually diverging to approximately the midpoint and diverging sharply to the blade. The sides have been carefully hammered to produce a bevel and a central ridge. The blade is moderately curved and is unexpanded at the tips (producing a blade width of 82.3mm). There is no evidence of flanges on the edges of the face but the axe has a lozenge-shaped long section, indicating it to be of 'Developed' form. The median bevel occurs at the midpoint of the axe (approximately 77mm from the butt, where the axe has a maximum thickness of 13.5mm and a width of 41.1mm). The axe faces are convex across their widths at the blade and butt and are near-flat at the mid-section. A gentle blade facet is discernible on both faces (occurring around 11mm from the blade edge). There is no evidence of applied decoration on the axe and no definite sharpening striations at the blade. The surface is heavily-pitted with a pale-green corrosion; patches of the original surface survive with a silvery, dark-green patina. 


Aylseford axes are typologically the most primitive and therefore the earliest of the Developed axe types (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 60) . This find represents the thirteenth known example of a recorded Aylesford type axe from Wales, with a general distribution centred on Glamorganshire and eastern Gwent for the seven examples from South Wales.","Metallurgical analysis  was attempted, with the axe examined whole within the specimen chamber. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from under the surface corrosion were analysed and apart from very superficial surface swabbing of the artefact there was no sample preparation. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefact, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion. 

Four separate readings were taken and the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable with other results. The average results showed the axe composition to be an unleaded tin-bronze containing 84.3% - 92.0% (with a mean of 83.9%) copper with 7.8% - 23.9% (with a mean of 15.4%) tin.

The axe is complete (with a length of 109.2mm and a weight of 356.1g). The butt is thin or sharp and arched (with a width of 36.9mm and a thickness of 2mm). Both faces are convex, giving the axe a lenticular body profile, with the thickest point (at 12.5mm) on the blade, approximately two-thirds of the way along the axe (around 40mm from the blade edge). There is no median bevel or blade facet on the faces, although the blade narrows sharply to the edge. The faces are flat across their widths, gradually becoming increasing convex towards the blade edge. The sides of the axe are straight and divergent along the upper half of the axe and are concave along the blade, turning out sharply at the ends to produce blade tips (which give the blade a width of 67.0mm).

The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 33.1mm and a weight of 64.6g). The axe has broken near the base of the socket (with a length of 31.0mm, a surviving width of 9.9mm and a maximum surviving depth of 9.1mm). The axe is of sub-rectangular section at the break (where the axe has a width of 41mm and a maximum thickness of 18.0mm). The casting flashes are clear and raised on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The sides curve outwards a little to produce a slightly expanded edge (producing a surviving blade width of 46.9mm). The blade faces are convex across both their lengths and width with no discernible blade facets and the original blade edge has been lost. There are no ribs extending onto the blade fragment. Where the surface survives, sharpening striations are evident running along the blade edge. Hammering facets are also discernible on both faces. The surface has a dark brown patination and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion.


The fragmentary state of the axe makes typological identification difficult; the form of the fragment is consistent with South Wales Type socketed axes. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although most recovered socketed axes, including the South Wales type are of the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-05-04T23:00:00Z,2010-06-18T23:00:00Z,,,64.6,,,,33.1,1,Mark Lodwick,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,Carmarthenshire,Carmarthenshire,Myddfai,,,,,PUBLIC-90F535,,2010.130.1i.JPG,Bronze Age Socketed Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.130.1i.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/339755.jpg

The dirk or rapier fragment is sub-triangular, with the incomplete base and shoulders and the base of the blade.

A central spine runs down the length of the fragment, with very worn and corroded edges remaining. In section, the blade is lozenge-shaped. While corrosion has undoubtably removed much of the blade, it seems likely that the blade edges has been worn through use in the Bronze Age and probably resharpened. The narrow point remaining on the fragment is probably due to breakage and corrosion of the dirk or rapier in the Bronze Age, with further corrosion in the post-depositional environment.


While the size of the fragment suggests the object was a dirk, comparison with rapiers from Northumberland indicates that it is only a few mm smaller in width at the shoulders in comparison with complete examples.

458653,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-700,"Bronze Age bronze spearhead fragment, of uncertain type and of Middle to Late Bronze Age date, c. 1500 - 700BC


The spearhead is fragmentary and is represented by the tip only (with a surviving length of 47.8mm and a weight of 22.7g). The spearhead has broken across the blade in antiquity and near the end of a circular socket (4.1mm diameter at the break and with a surviving depth of 5.8mm), positioned slightly off-centre. The fragment has a prominent rounded midrib (giving the spearhead a maximum surviving thickness of 10.5mm where the fragment has a maximum surviving width of 19.8mm). The midrib weakens slightly towards the tip but remains prominent. The original blade edges and tip have been lost, making the original outline uncertain but the more complete edge is gently convex and may originally have been straight or near-straight. Patches of the original surface survive with a dark-green patina. Sharpening striations are discernible running both along the blade and at an acute angle to the blade edge.


Socketed spearheads begin in the Acton Park metalworking industry dated to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age and continue to the Llyn Fawr Industry at the very end of the Bronze Age, although spearheads of the Llyn Fawr industry are rarely recovered, with most spearheads dating to the Ewart Park phase or before.

The axe is fragmentary, represented by part of the blade edge (with a surviving length of 25.6mm, a surviving width of 30.9mm, a maximum surviving thickness of 10.4mm and a weight of 37.7g). The surviving side is near-straight and slightly divergent to the blade tip (producing a surviving blade width of 30.0mm). The side suggests that the axe was of slightly hexagonal section. The casting seam is evident and has been fettled, seemingly by hammering. The axe faces were gently concave across their widths but slightly convex across their lengths. At the break there is the slight suggestion of a rectangular base to a socket, possibly suggesting that the axe has broken across the socket base, although the identification is somewhat speculative. There is a notch in the blade edge which seemingly occurred in antiquity. The current surface is heavily-pitted with a mid-green patina.


The casting seam on the axe implies a casting technology using a two or three piece mould technology and therefore an axe of cast-flanged type at the earliest, and more likely a palstave or socketed axe fragment.

The fragment consists of only the very tip of the spearhead - it has a narrow and slender tip with a pronounced midrib. The midrib is rounded in section and is flanked by tapering wings that join at the tip. There are pronounced edge bevels which are 3-4mm from the edge of the spear. The tip is slightly damaged and abraded. One of the wings has broken at the wider end but has been glued back together. The edges of the spear head are worn and chipped. The break at the wider end is patinated. The mid rib is hollow. Since only the tip of the spear head has survived it is not possible to identify an exact form or class of spear head. However, there are perhaps similarities to Triangular spear heads from the Penard Phase (1300 - 1140 BC) in the middle Bronze Age. Please compare to PAS record IDs: SWYOR-8E7758 and YORYM-6DB701. Should such an identification from the fragment be correct, the most likely classification would be of a 'projecting basal looped' spearhead, Davis Group 9.

A casting seam is visible above the fracture on the axe blade. The axe has fractured obliquely; the two pieces were found by a metal detectorist approximately 1m apart. There are small areas of pitting across the surface containing a powdery green corrosion product.


The blade is an unusual shape, having lateral indentations similar to another socketed axehead from the Nettleham hoard (P.J.Davey, Bronze Age Metalwork from Lincolnshire, p.103). The blade is comparable in form to earlier palstave axeheads, and this object may therefore represent a transitional form between the Middle and Late Bronze Age. Colin Burgess described this as metalwork stage XI (Wilburton). The most recent and generally accepted revised chronology by Needham (1996) would place it in his Period 6, 1150-950 cal BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2011-08-26T23:00:00Z,,,"Central Searchers, Alford, Lincs",126.2,,,21.1,80.8,1,Adam Daubney,Adam Daubney,East Midlands,Lincolnshire,East Lindsey,Alford,TF4476,GPS (from the finder),53.261461,0.157404,LIN-63F291,,AL478.jpg,Bronze age socketed axe,Lincolnshire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/AL478.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/344549.jpg

462200,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-800,"An incomplete cast differentially corroded hook-shaped dense base-metal object, of probable Bronze Age dating.


The artefact is semi-circular in plan, and oval in cross section. It has a rectangular hollow opening, which still contains some soil. The top then flattens out before narrowing and curving to a point. In form and size it resembles the tusk of a pig or wild boar. Original, but longitudinally cracking surfaces survive on the interior concave curved side however original surfaces are almost entirely missing on the exterior convex shaped side.


Microscope examination of the exterior surface suggests a small area of original surface survives approximately 18-22mm from the tapering tip end, indicating that the object was probably originally tapered in shape and not broken or differentially eroded here. The original surfaces have a dark grey black patina, while the corroded surfaces are a mottled light to mid-grey color.


It measures 56.63mm in length, 37.60mm wide and 14.47mm thick. It weighs 40.4 grams.


Metallurgical analysis found the object to be made of pure tin.


Identification of this object is at present unknown, but it was found in the same hole, touching the Socketed Axe head, LVPL-F314E0, suggesting that it is of Bronze Age date and therefore potential Treasure. Tin was a key metal of the Bronze Age, alloyed with copper to form bronze. While there is no determining technological or compositional feature to confidently date this hook-shaped object specifically to the Late Bronze Age, its form and corrosion is consistent with being an ancient rather than a modern object.


Careful examination of the hook-shaped tin object suggests it was deliberately shaped as an attachment or handle to a larger object, although the possibilities of it being an unusually shaped adornment, talisman or ingot cannot be discounted. The hollowed-out, widened and sub-rectangular shaped top would appear to have been the point of attachment to a larger composite object, the head slotting into a peg or projecting fitting. Observation of the narrowing end with a microscope gives tentative support for it having been deliberately shaped and tapered, rather than the outcome of differential corrosion and damage since burial. This suggests that it was only secured at one end. It is possible that the tin hook was once the hidden core of a handle or attachment with a sheet or cast bronze outer surface.",,4,Tin or tin alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2011-08-20T23:00:00Z,,2011W27,,40.4,,,14.47,56.63,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,Wales,Flintshire,Flintshire,,,,,,LVPL-F33C38,,LVPL-F33C38.jpg,Bronze Age: Unidentified object,National Museums Liverpool ,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/LVPL-F33C38.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/345566.jpg

463768,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (probably bronze) socketed spear (spear head) of Middle to Late Bronze Age dating (1500 to 800 BC).



The spearhead fragment consists of the upper part of the spear, being broken at the top of the socket. The edges of the blade are lost. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a distinct bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is sub circular in shape and positioned toward one side of the section.



At the break the socket has an internal diameter of 6.00mm and the sockets depth is 12.17mm. The blade (sides) of the spearhead is incomplete having been heavily abraded in the burial environment. This damage has resulted in the loss of shape to the blade and the blunting / loss of the tip. The spear blades cutting edges have been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by an expanding (tip to base) lozenge sectioned shaped midrib. This midrib originally expanded into the socket of the spear. The central line of the mid-rib extends to break and is more distinct on one face. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead.



The spearhead is a dark brown to mid green colour with an even but much corroded patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface and patina. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.



The spearhead fragment measures 65.57mm length, has a maximum width of 23.74mm and maximum thickness of 11.53mm. The spearhead weighs 33.1 grams



It is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.

464328,Fish Hook,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-2400,-450,"A copper object, made from circular-section wire which tapers from about 6mm in diameter at a blunt, squared-off wider end to about 4mm immediately below, then gently tapers to c. 3mm at the curve. It curves around a little over 180 degrees to form a hook which measures in total c. 42mm long by 24mm wide. The tip is pointed and has no barb; there is no hole or eye for attachment at the blunt end.



This object is strikingly similar to an object known as a fish hook, now in the British Museum (1989,0601.225), which was apparently found in the 'Batheaston' hoard of Bronze Age and Iron Age objects. The hoard was not recorded at the time of discovery, and was then dispersed by sale; the findspot is thought to be either Batheaston, near Bath, or Wylye, Wiltshire.



Because of the possibility that this object was a prehistoric fish hook, it was given an XRF analysis to determine the composition of its surface. This gave a result of 99.99 % copper and 0.01 % arsenic, which is unfortunately not diagnostic of any particular date.



It is large for a fish hook, and pure copper, being relatively soft, is perhaps not the best material for a hook intended to catch large, powerful fish. It may alternatively be a pin.","

This axe, apparently unused, may have been intended as a votive deposit, particularly in view of its valley bottom location.

A cast copper alloy so-called fitting of later Bronze Age or Iron Age date, similar to the so-called 'moustache-like' fittings. The object is tear-drop shaped in plan, hollow on the underside and its upper  surfaces are decorated with closely-set longitudinal grooves. The 'snout' of the object tapers and narrows in both plan and section, and gives the whole object the look of a hedgehog. It is likely that a long point protruding from the 'snout' has now broken off, as a number of similar examples on this database have long projections in this area.
","A number of objects of this type have been recorded on the PAS  database. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998,  no.117), and as such, they are thought to date from the middle Bronze  Age to the late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that  they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be  confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.

476945,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1125,"A cast copper alloy incomplete spearhead dating from the later Middle Bronze Age, about 1400 – 1125 BC. Davis Group 10, 'protected looped'. Only one side (wing) of the leaf shaped blade survives, and the tip is missing. The centre rib is circular in section and hollow (socketed). The lower edge of the blade is rounded, though this is emphasised by also being bent. There is a carefully made hole through the wing next to the rib at the base. The hole has corroded edges and its original shape is not clear. It has a D shaped (in plan and section) cast raised flange on the side opposite the rib, on both faces. The spear has a grey green patina with corrosion where the original surface is missing. The breaks are also patinated. Compare BH-16AD90, LEIC-96FB06, BERK-2CF486 and DOR-FD69C8. Davis (2017) notes that spearheads of this type, with 'small loops in the lower quartile of the blade, adjacent to the midrib' belonged to the same range of 'generally larger' spearheads with basal loops, and 'were current in the Taunton and Penard phases', about 1400 – 1125 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2011-09-23T23:00:00Z,2011-09-23T23:00:00Z,,Bishop Burton 23rd to 25th Sep 2011,146.68,,,17.91,116.54,1,Kevin Leahy,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,East Riding of Yorkshire,East Riding of Yorkshire,Bishop Burton,SE9639,Centred on field,53.838391,-0.542582,SWYOR-1F7502,,PAS_1621_spear.jpg,Bronze Age Spear,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1621_spear.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/359903.jpg

Very little of the original surface of this axe survives and the present surface is rough and deeply pitted. On both sides of the lower part of the septum, adjacent to the break are areas of decoration. The decoration is very difficult to interpret clearly as only a few patches survive undamaged. On the better preserved side the decoration appears as three transverse bands of diagonal crosses with some straight transverse lines. One band can be discerned on the other side. The axe may have had a slight median bevel. The decoration may have continued onto the blade.

480427,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Cast copper alloy socketed side-looped spearhead dating from the middle to late Bronze Age, (1500-800BC). The spearhead is almost complete. The head is leaf-shaped and the socket has a pronounced midrib. The mid rib is lozenge shape and extends to the base of the socket where it is slightly facetted rather than raised. The tip of the spearhead is thicker than the rest of the blade and there are re-sharpening marks around the edges of the wings. The edges of the blade has been damaged in most places. The string loops are narrow with oval central piercings. In profile they are oval

(lentoid) having a wider profile than many string looped examples. The base of the socket is broken - probably relatively recently. The socket measures 17.49mm in diameter. The side loops are 24.42mm below the end of the wings and are in good condition. The object is undecorated and had a dark black patina.



The blade facets are all lost and it has been plough rolled - probably loosing the tip of the spear as well.



The spearhead is a string loop type, which suggests later middle Bronze Age to early late Bronze Age date. Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age.
