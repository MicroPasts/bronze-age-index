893324,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1200,"A complete copper-alloy annular bracelet/arm-ring probably of Bronze Age date 1400 - 1300 BC. The Liss-type bracelet is solid and oval in section and in good condition with brown patina. The body is decorated with incised or engraved panels which are relatively deep and have been applied with some degree of care. The complex decoration comprises of panels of lines or rows of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern separated by 'dividing' sections of 10 or more lines of vertical bands (to the circumference of the bracelet-arming). The three central panels are comprised of 8 or 9 horizontal bands that widen to create an oval, the centre of which are decorated with 6 vertical bands.



As an oval, the external diameter is 95.5mm by 83.7mm with an internal diameter of 66.8mm by 52.1mm and a width of 12.9 mm. A comparison on the database is: SUR-590F5D no.1","Similar plain and incised (Liss-type) bracelets in copper alloy are not common finds. They are known from the Taunton phase (1,400 -1,200 BC) of the Bronze Age onwards, mainly from Southern Britain. These bracelets concentrate in the southern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and West Sussex and examples are also known from Suffolk and Norfolk. Incised decorated bracelets form part of a North European tradition, which has led to the suggestion that the examples from southern England may be imported from northern France, although this theory has been questioned (O'Connor 1980). While some of the known bracelets come from hoards containing items such as torcs, pins, axes, palstaves and other mid-Bronze Age artefacts, no other objects were found in association with this example. See Recent Metalwork Discoveries in Hampshire for a comprehensive report, published by Sally Worrell in Hampshire Studies (2002, no.1). They are comparatively rarer than tools and weapons. Similar examples were found in the Ebbesbourne Wake hoard (Moore and Rowlands 1972:63-5, Plate XV) and a hoard from Norton Fitzwarren (Needham in Ellis 1989:31-31, 36).",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,346.5,83.7,,12.9,,1,Dr. Lindsey Smith,Dr. Lindsey Smith,South East,Oxfordshire,Cherwell,Merton,SP5719,From finder,51.8666749,-1.17358811,BERK-7B524E,,BAbracelet.jpg,BA Bracelet,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BAbracelet.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1006991.jpg

896436,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A copper alloy lower blade fragment from a palstave dating to the Middle Bronze Age, circa 1500-1300 BC. 



The shape of the fragment is sub-triangular in plan and triangular in profile; the cross section at the break is sub-rectangular in form. The blade is broken below the stop ridge, due to this it is uncertain whether this fragment is from a looped - or unlooped palstave variant. The sides of the palstave gently taper from the break to the blade where the tips of the blade protrude markedly. The cutting edge is crescentic and relatively well defined, however it is very worn and the cutting edge is now abraded. Both faces of the axe have single central swollen ribs that extend to above the blade. 



The palstave fragment has a mid-green coloured slightly abraded patina. 



Burgess and Schmidt (1981) illustrate a number of similar palstaves in their catalogue. The closest parallels can be seen in the classification Primary shield Pattern Palstaves most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5). The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group II type which has a mid rib decoration. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC. There are parallels recorded on the PAS database; for example (WAW-3A6465) was discovered in the Malvern Hills area of Worcestershire. 



The palstave fragment measures 64.1 mm length, is 60.4 mm wide at the blade, 14.9 mm thick at the broken edge. It weighs 146.7 grams.

Description: The object has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentric cutting edge. What is left of the socket is socket is sub-rectangular in cross section.

One of the wide faces has a slight decorative elongated 'H' shaped depression in it. The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.

897719,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A Middle Bronze Age ornament hoard, consisting of two Liss arm rings (one in three pieces), an unlooped palstave axe, a quoit-headed pin (in three pieces), a knife/ razor fragment and a fragment of spear tip. The two smaller fragments of arm ring were found c. 3 foot from the rest of the hoard, which was in situ; the two fragments have presumably been moved by the plough.



1) Complete Liss type arm-ring, measuring 83.7mm in diameter (internal diameter 62.1mm), 12.2mm in height and weighing 174g (to the nearest 2g). It is sub-circular/ oval in cross-section (having a width of c.11mm) with an undecorated inside surface. This edge retains much of the original patina which has a high shine, is dark green in colour and very smooth. Much of the rest of the surface is pitter with areas (of varying sizes) of much lighter green corrosion.

The top, bottom and outside surface of the ring has incised linear decoration. Along the top and bottom is a concentric ring of 'herringbone' decoration, comprising integrally stacked chevrons or V-shapes. These chevrons face in an opposite direction along the top to the bottom. The outside surface decoration can be divided into two sections, each occupying half of the arm-ring.

One section can be separated into three areas of decoration, transverse (and ever-so-slightly diagonal) linear incised lines at either end with a middle section of three-and-a half longitudinal lines of herringbone (incised chevron) decoration, the half line being a line of half-chevrons. The two end sections of transverse incised lines are each divided into four sections of roughly equal size (comprising c.10 transverse lines each, but ranging between 8 and 11 lines in some sections). The central divider is a pair of incised herringbone lines, pointing in the same direction (either outwards or inwards) on each face. The remaining two dividers are of 'ladder' decoration, a vertical section with short transverse lines between.

The second section extends from the transverse linear decoration (mentioned above) in the form of a group of larger and closely integrally-stacked chevrons, twenty one side and eighteen on the other. Between is a short zig-zag of four diagonal groups of incised lines in opposing directions (between 12 and 16 lines in each group).



2) Complete Liss type arm-ring, in three pieces. It measures 84.8mm in diameter (internal diameter 63.0mm), 12.1mm in height and weighs 182.81g. It is oval in cross-section (with a width of 10.9mm) and like no.1 is not decorated on the inside surface. This retains a dark brown, high-shine, smooth patina but has many small patches of active corrosion. Likewise the rest of the surface and the broken ends of the object have a large amount of light green corrosion. The decoration appears to take identical form to 1), each half being treated in the same way with similar numbers of incised lines. The three-and-a-half lines of additional herringbone and the ladder decoration also appear in the same places; there is no decorative difference. The surface is however rather obscured by the extensive corrosion.



3) Incomplete quoit-headed pin, in three pieces, including most of the ring-shaped head and two sections of the shank; it is not clear whether any of these pieces join with each other. Its reconstructed length is 241.2mm. The probable tip of the shank is a little bent and the head incomplete, suggesting an estimated original length for these three pieces together is c.250mm. The diameter of the head of the pin is 73.5mm (internal 53.4mm) and it is max.2.1mm thick. The pin shank measures from c.4-3mm in diameter and retains a very shiny, smooth, dark green patina; the head retains a mostly shiny, smooth dark green and coppery-coloured patina but with numerous small patches of light green corrosion. The three pieces weigh 31.33g collectively.

The head consists of a rim 1.6mm thick with a raised rim to either side, 2.1mm tall. Within the shallower area is an incised zig-zag decoration, with the alternate resulting triangles being filled with incised diagonals, parallel to the far-left edge (with the head place uppermost and shank extending downwards). The decorated triangles have their wider end at the outside edge and the undecorated triangles at the inside edge. There are 29 'pairs' of triangles on one side and 22 on the other. The edge of the ring widens from c.8mm where the shanks extends to 11.7mm at the furthest break and 9.9mm at the nearer break; all breaks are old.

The shank extends from the narrowest part of the ring, from a rectangular panel of incised line decoration. On one side this takes the form of a herringbone motif (point towards the internal edge) while the other has crossed diagonal lines extending from either side of the ring and extending into the top of the shank. The shank extends for c.13mm before the old break, where it has an oval cross-section and measures 4.3x3.8mm.

Both sections of shank are circular in cross-section. One narrows from 4.3mm to 3.8mm over 83.6mm while the other narrows from 3.7mm to 3.1mm, at which point much of the external surface of the metal is lost and a wire projection extends 1.8mm in diameter. This section is 74.9mm long.



4) Unlooped palstave belonging to the Norman type. These imports from across the Channel occur in other hoards near Fareham. It measures 154mm in length, 40.9mm wide at the cutting edge, 25.1mm wide and 29.8mm thick at the stop ridge, and weighs 340g (to the nearest 2g). The axehead is complete with some damage to the cutting edge. Where the original patina is visible, it is a silvery-copper colour, shiny and smooth. However the blade and butt end in particular have smaller and larger patches of active light green corrosion.

The blade of the palstave is a long isoceles triangle in shape with expanding sides and a curved cutting edge (where not damaged). In profile the blade is triangular with the widest section being below the stop ridge. Both faces have 'trident decoration' in the form of a triangular- or shield-shaped depression below the stop ridge with a vertical central rib extending from the stop ridge. This central ridge does not extend beyond the shield'.

The butt-end of the axehead is rectangular in shape and triangular in profile. On both faces, the flanges decrease in height from the stop ridge to the butt end.



5) An incomplete blade with no original edges surviving, perhaps from a knife or razor. It measures 28.7mm in incomplete length, 18.1mm in max.width, 2.6mm in max.thickness and weighs 5.09g. The object has a wide central mid-rib, extending in a Y-shape from the wider end (18.1mm wide and max.1.6mm thick) to the narrower end (12.8mm wide and 2.6mm thick). The cross-section at the narrower end is lenticular while it is rather flatter and more rectangular at the wider end. The object has a smooth, shiny, blue-green patina and the breaks, while jagged, are perhaps recentish.



6) A fragment of spearhead blade, measuring 15.9mm in length, max.12.6mm wide, 6.1mm in thickness and weighing 3.05g. It has a greyish-brown patina, silvery in places, smooth and lightly pitted. The object has a pronounced lozengiform cross-section with incurved long edges.","
With special thanks to Brenan O'Connor for recognising the palstave as a Norman type.

The pin is incomplete, missing its lower shaft. This is circular in cross section and widens as it reaches the head from 2mm to 3.5 mm in diameter. The head is 3 mm deep and 11 mm in diameter. It is circular in form and triangular in cross section, emerging from the shaft and widening to form a disc with a concave upper surface which contains a central circular depression. There is no decoration.



Pins of this type are hard to date as they are not often discovered within hoards. The artefact form is likely to be prevalent from the Ornament Horizon (1500 / 1400 BC) through into the Iron Age (at least until 500 BC). The form of the pin is similar to SF-509598, described as a Picardy type and dated to 1400-1250BC and is also similar to examples excavated from Flag Fen (Flag fen cat no 173-185 fig 10.9 pp274-275) these later examples have be dated through metalurgical anaylsis to the Wilburton phases of the later Bronze Age (Needham Period 6) c. 1150-1000 BC.

The axehead is wedge-shaped with a square socket mouth and a moulded everted collar. The remains of four runners / casting jets in the form of raised ovate knops are present - being positioned at the mid-point of each side of the mouth. Internally the socket is wedge shaped - it tapers and narrows to the cutting edge. Externally the sides of the axehead are broadly parallel before expanding to form a crescentic shaped blade with distinct blade tips. On the upper part of the socket is a D-shaped, ovate sectioned attachment loop it is positioned directly below the swollen collar. Casting flashes are present on both sides of the axehead including the loop and a crack is present along one corner. The flashes have been trimmed and hammered flat. Likewise the blade is prepared and sharpened - suggesting the axe was in a condition where it would have been usable.Three distinct vertical ribs are present on the two widest surfaces of the axehead, these commence from the underside of the moulded collar and taper to blunt points on the lower blade before the cutting facet of the axe.



The metal has a largely shiny reddish/brown patina with some green patches on the blade. The area around the socket is slightly blackened while the ribs retain a brassy shine. Peter Reavill Finds Liaison Officer - Herefordshire & Shropshire comments that this is a common feature with the axes seemingly dipped or deliberately blackened, and the ribs then polished resulting in a shiny gold on black effect.

899611,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"A cast copper-alloy miniature flat axe head of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC. Sub-triangular in plan, lenticular in section and in profile. At 101 mm in length the axe is slightly over half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age axe from South-west England. It is 43.5 mm wide at the blade end, tapering to 20 mm near the damaged butt end; its maximum thickness is 9.5 mm and its weight 164.45 g. The sides are straight and do not flare outwards to meet the blade edge which is slightly curved in plan. Much of the original surface has been lost and the axe is pitted and abraded through corrosion and movement within the plough soil. One face is less corroded but there is no evidence of any form of incised decoration on the surface of the axe. The butt end has broken in antiquity to create a central projection which has subsequently worn to a smooth point. The break suggests that part of the axehead was left in the haft or handle which means that it was used.



Pearce (1983) describes a miniature Migdale (Sutherland, Scotland) type flat axe, with a slightly flared blade, from Banner Down, Somerset on page 502, which is illustrated in pl.69, no.587 and a wider, broader Migdale type flat axe with straight sides from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall on page 418, pl.12, no.98c, which are both associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) discuss Migdale flat axes on pp.35-45 and the Biggar variants, with their straighter sides and less rounded cutting edges, on pp.46-48. These are illustrated in plates 5 to 19. A similar small flat axe with straight sides and a shallow curve to the blade, of the Biggar variant type, from Yorkshire, which is the same length, is illustrated in pl.19, no.241.



There are similar miniature Migdale type axes recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a 'Biggar' variant of the Migdale type of flat axe, but these have slightly crescentic blades.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, p.122) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,164.45,,,9.5,101,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Advent,SX1082,GPS (from the finder),50.60670323,-4.68656202,CORN-3237B8,,DSCN0203.JPG,flat axe (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN0203.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1012112.jpg
899615,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"Cast copper alloy fragment of a Bronze Age socketed axe, sub-rectangular in plan and in section and triangular in profile. The fragment consists of the blade end of a socketed axe, 44.5 mm long, 29.5 mm wide at the blade end, 15 mm in height and 4 mm thick at the broken end, and 41.35 g in weight. The entire surface is oxidized to a pale green. The base of the sub-rectangular socket is slightly dished and would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe.The almost parallel sides of the fragment are slightly convex, with a faint linear casting seam on each side. The blade is very slightly expanded from the sides of the axe at the cutting edge, which would have been the result of sharpening during use. The cutting edge is rounded and slightly damaged although this appears to be limited to the surface corrosion and is more likely the result of soil movement than of use. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).

899617,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy blade, possibly the point from a Bronze Age sword, kite-shaped in plan and lozenge-shaped in profile. The broken end appears to have been deliberately cut to create a pointed apex which may have been to improve hafting if the fragment was re-used as some sort of perforating tool. This break is not typical of the deliberate breaking up of swords into fragments for deposition, which is often clean and perpendicular to the edge (Matt Knight pers comm). None of the original surface remains, as the fragment is so corroded and pitted from being in the sea, and there is no evidence of any mid rib which is common to Bronze Age swords. It is also very narrow for a sword blade but may come from a narrow Wilburton phase type sword or a blade that is stepped and narrowed in plan like the Carp's Tongue Complex sword, though the latter is not found in Cornwall.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a sword with a narrow blade and point from Weymouth, Dorset, on page 666, pl.105, no.476, which is dated from the Wilburton phase of the late Middle Bronze Age, c.1150-1000 BC.

The vestigial remains of loop are present, with a broken and abraded projection from one lateral face below the stop ridge. Each broad face features corroded rident or shield shaped decoration, cast in low relief below the stop ridge.

900230,Mould,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1200,"Middle Bronze Age bronze mould for casting palstaves of Group III, Low Flanged Type of Taunton Metalworking Industry and probably dated to c. 1400 - 1200BC

The mould is represented by one valve of the pair, with a fragment missing from its base (blade end) (with a length of 197mm and a weight of 510.8g). The mouth (with a thickness of 14mm) is flat on its top surface and is damaged on one side. The exterior of the mould was circular-sectioned at its apex (with a diameter of 43.0mm) becoming hexagonal-sectioned at the neck, which has near straight and parallel sides as far as the position of the loop, where the sides have a rounded swelling, pronounced on the loop side but also present, although subtle on the unlooped side (reaching a maximum width of 54.8mm). The front of the mould has a prominent central groove along the neck (with a maximum depth of 9mm) and corresponding with the septum between the flanges. The mould half reaches a maximum thickness (of 24mm) at the position of the stop. The lower part of the exterior was also hexagonally-sectioned, with straight sides diverging to the base. The basal edge has largely been lost (with a surviving maximum width of 75mm) but appears to have had a gentle curved edge and has a bevel from the face to the edge (9mm thick). The blade part of the exterior was decorated with three divergent ribs, which extended to the basal edge. The surviving part of the basal edge, above the bevel is also enhanced with a rib as is the top of the side bevels. There is a chevron moulding on one side, corresponding with position of the loop.

The interior of the mould has a rounded channel at the apex as a reservoir for the molten bronze (11mm diameter and 26mm deep) feeding into the butt of the palstave. The flat top, where the two mould halves meet is of variable width (from 8.2mm ay the butt and the blade tips and 14.5mm below the loop) and has four locating sockets, to engage with tenons from the missing mould valve. The sockets are of lentoid form (18mm long, 5mm wide and 3mm deep) and with a pair located flanking the butt and a pair beneath the top of the blade. The palstave negative has gently convex sides to the upper part (with a maximum width above the stop of 24.5mm) and the flanges appear to gradually deepen, reaching their maximum height at the stop (where the mould has a depth of 14.4mm). The loop (22mm long, 11 wide, with a mould depth of 5mm and where the palstave has a width of 19mm) is positioned immediately below the stop at its lower end. The stop has a slight curvature. The sides of the blade are curved and divergent to the blade tips, one of which is missing (with a maximum surviving width of 59mm, and the mould has a depth of 2.3mm at the blade edge).The sides of the blade are perpendicular to the blade face, which appear to be moderately flat across its length and width but gradually becomes shallower. There is the suggestion of a groove running along the edge of the blade, perhaps indicating a subtle rib running along the palstave blade edge. The palstave blade would have been decorated with midrib (with a length of 65mm), beginning at the stop. There is an oval casting flaw depression (7mm x 5mm and 1.6mm deep) on the blade, slightly above one of the blade tips.

The interior and exterior faces of the mould have differing corrosion deposits or patinas, the exterior face has a pale brown corrosion deposit which has a tendency to flake off, revealing a pale, 'olive-green' patina. The interior surface has the same or similar brown corrosion over one side and the jet reservoir but elsewhere has a darker-green to black patina. Most of the scratches and striations inside the mould appear to cut through the patina and are likely to be more recent. There is a crack extending from the break on the blade to the side edge, consolidated at Amgueddfa Cymru prior to recording. Palstave moulds are commonly broken across their base or basal corners and Adams (pers. Comm.) has speculated about the possibility of deliberate damage across this area of the mould but suggests that the base is more likely to be a weaker area more susceptible to damage.

The mould would appear to have cast palstaves of Group III, Low Flanged (broad blade) type with a midrib, possibly of Type Sleaford or Type Harlech. The suggested grooves along the sides of the blade may suggest flange extensions, characteristic of Type Sleaford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p133) . Sleaford palstaves are seen as beginning early in the life of broad blade palstaves with an uncertain longevity (ibid.). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to c. 1500 - 1150BC.

Only one other bronze palstave mould find is know from Wales, recovered from Deansfield near Bangor, Gwynedd, which comprised two mould pairs for a looped and unlooped palstave of Middle Bronze Age date. Webley and Adams' (2016) study lists eleven palstave mould finds recorded from Britain, including two locations with associated sets of mould pairs (Deansfield and Hempnall, Norfolk) and nine of which include both valves. Five of the palstave mould finds (from four separate finds) are looped and of Middle Bronze Age date, recovered from London, Deansfield (Gwynedd), two pairs from Hepmall (Norfolk),) and South Wiltshire. Of these finds, only the London mould valve was not decorated on the exterior. An additional palstave mould was recovered from Marton in Shropshire but with no detail recorded. Webley and Adams (2016, p. 324) noted that Later Prehistoric mould finds were absent in South Wales at that time. There has been little recorded Middle Bronze Age activity in the area around the findspot and the suggestion of contemporary metalworking is a significant new addition to our understanding of the Bronze Age of the area.","Metallurgical Analysis of the mould

By Phil Parkes



The bronze palstave mould was analysed using SEM-EDX and XRF analysis to determine metal composition. XRF analysis on the interior and exterior of the mould showed the two surfaces to contain the same elements with slightly different proportions, most likely due to surface depletion / enrichment due to corrosion. SEM-EDX analysis was carried out on a sample taken from the broken edge of the mould using a small hand drill to remove surface corrosion and extract flakes of the uncorroded metal. The analysis showed a bronze (83% copper and 15% tin) with small amounts of lead (0.5%), arsenic (0.8%) and nickel (0.5%) present.



There are clear differences in the composition of the core metal and the interior patinated surface confirmed by both SEM and XRF analysis which are due to surface enrichment effects.



The bronze mould has a number of small areas where a white substance, thought to be a modern clay used to take a cast from the mould, remains. A sample of the modern clay was compared to a sample of the white material removed from the mould for analysis by SEM-EDX. The results show that the two substances are the same (Figure 6) and consist of a fibrous clay-based material with a calcium sulphate (CaSO4) filler.

900449,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,,,"Copper alloy mount or fitting of uncertain function and date, probably of Late Bronze Age or Iron Age date and possibly a scabbard chape.



The possible cast mount is complete (with a length of 23.5mm, a height of 22.9mm and a weight of 18.0g). The mount is of bulbous bi-lobed form (21.5mm wide and 13.1mm thick) with a curving point projecting from each lobe. At the centre is a shallow rounded groove, widest at the base. Both lobes are decorated with prominent ribbing defined by grooves. The lobes terminate in gently curving points of rounded D-shaped section, slightly flattened on their interiors. The points are not decorated and the interior, near the centre is less finished than the rest of the mount. At the centre is an irregular, sub-circular depression or hollowing (6.6mm wide, 7.6long and 4.2mm deep). The interior is not finished and would not have been seen. The surface has a dark-brown patina with orange brown residue or corrosion surviving in the deeper grooves.



The object, often referred to as a 'moustache' is recognised object form but poorly understood in terms of its function and date. The object form is quite consistent, being bi-lobed and rounded, often with ribbed decoration and with projecting prongs. An example of the type was found with the Salisbury Hoard and indicates a Bronze or Iron Age date although the style would suggest a Late Bronze to Iron Age date. It has been suggested that the mount may have been used on Iron Age weapons and it seems possible that the pronged form may be consistent with its use as a scabbard chape, although this remains a conjectural identification.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-02-11T00:00:00Z,,,,18,22.9,,13.1,23.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llantilio Crossenny,SO3915,From a paper map,51.83026815,-2.88660062,NMGW-AF1FCC,,201725copy.jpg,"Copper alloy mount or fitting of uncertain function and date, probably of Late Bronze Age or Iron Age date and possibly a scabbard chape",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/201725copy.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1012032.jpg
900485,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age knife or razor probably of Late Bronze Age date

The knife or razor is of crescent form and appears to be near-complete but is perhaps missing a tang (with a length of 51.3mm, a height of 40.1mm and a weight of 43.9g). The blade edge is concave with a deep-arched back. The blade tips at both ends may have been elongated, as suggested shallowing to the curve at the back. One tip has a small semi-circular notch (3.3mm diameter), possibly the remnants of a rivet attachment hole and if correct, may suggest a slight tang on that side. There is an irregular long notch (12.5m long and 3.3mm deep) on the top edge, just below the apex and may also be the result of hafting. The blade is thickest at the centre (with a maximum thickness of 4.4mm) and thins at a blade facet on both edges and on both faces. The blade facet has a consistent length (of 7.4mm) along the edge. The surface is more corroded on one face and is dark-green brown with pale. The opposite face has a dark-green patina with a few striations evident running along the blade, possibly from sharpening.



The bronze blade is difficult to closely parallel with British archaeological finds but is perhaps best paralleled with Late Bronze Age Hog backed or triangular knives or Racloirs. The blade edge on these examples is usually comparatively straight rather than concave and perhaps suggests a specialised function. The possible rivet indent on one end and damage to the apex, perhaps suggest a tanged knife with handle on one end but covering the top of the blade.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-03-26T00:00:00Z,,,,43.9,40.1,,4.4,51.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Caerwent,ST4789,,51.59733773,-2.76655802,NMGW-B18276,,2017231copy.jpg,Bronze Age knife or razor probably of Late Bronze Age date,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2017231copy.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1012077.jpg
900624,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"Late Bronze Age date (c. 1150-600 BC) pegged spearhead. The copper alloy spearhead is almost complete with the edges of the blade being abraded and the rim of the socket is damaged recently. The blade is a slender leaf-shape and the edges of the blade are slightly bevelled. The midrib tapers towards the tip, which is missing and expands to the socket. The socket is still filled with soil, and is 17.36mm diameter on the interior and 22.03mm diameter on the exterior. The socket is decorated with three bands of triple stranded grooves. On the exterior edges of the outer grooves there is a very fine low-relief zig-zag design. The socket also has a circular perforation on one side, the perforation on the other side is not visible due to corrosion.



The surface of the spearhead has a well-developed shiny dark brown patina.



The spearhead measures 129.77mm in length, 22.03mm diameter at the socket, 27.44mm wide across the blade and weighs 74.45g with soil.



The spearhead is a pegged spearhead which date to the late Bronze Age (c. 1150-600 BC) and are usually found in the Thames Valley, Cambridge Fens and east Midlands.



This spearhead type can be attributed to Davis (2016: 2) Group 11, where he states that Group 11 'represents 72% of the corpus. Attributes are peg holes in the socket and various blade forms e.g. an even curve from blade/socket junction to the tip; a wide curving blade base with blade edges then leading straight to the tip. Overall spearhead length varies considerably from c.100mm to c.400mm. Several have incised decoration on the socket.'

The object consists of a concave butt with tapering sides. It has parallel slightly flanged edges tapering outwards before becoming part of the curved edge of the blade. The blade then tapers gently on either side meeting forming the cutting edge. The object is undecorated though treating with renaissance wax has been attempted resulting in a purple patina. The original patina was brown with green corrosion, and there are traces of green indicating its copper alloy consititution. The blade has pitted badly on both sides and one side of the blade is also badly pitted along the septum and butt end. The object is consistent in form with the Arreton flanged axes, dating to the Metal Assemblage type VI, circa 1700-1500 corresponding to late Early Bronze Age and the early Middle Bronze Age.

902221,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-650,"An incomplete copper alloy socketed gouge, of Late Bronze Age dating circa AD 1100 BC to 650 BC.



The object consists of the tip only with the rest of the object missing. The tip has a 'U' shaped blade. The gouge has a circular cross section. The object has tapering sides. The upper edge is damaged an uneven. The tip is narrowed, rounded and slightly flattened. One of the long edges faces is flattened. The opposing side is convex. The gouge has a dark green coloured patina with significant abrasion and pitting on the surfaces.



An incomplete example is recorded on the PAS database which was discovered in Herefordshire (HESH-A48FE1) the description explains how 'Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC'.

902424,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1200,"A complete miniature Palstave of the Middle Bronze Age, dating from c. 1, 300 B.C - 1,200 B.C.



The palstave is broadly rectangular in plan and is lentoid in profile. There are raised ridges on the outer edge of each side forming a H shape in profile at the butt end. The butt is slightly concave and tapers to a rounded rectangular end. Slightly off centre is a raised horizontal mid rib with a three pronged head decoration, forming a trident pattern and two oval depressions in the surface. The blade is triangular and flares out, the cutting edge is visible, and tapers to a sharp edge.



The axehead measures 53.2 mm in length. It is 16.9 mm wide at the blade, 11.7 mm wide at the midrib, and is 7.1 mm wide at the butt end. The object measures 8.6 mm thick at the midrib, the blade is 2.9 mm thick and the butt is 1.8 mm thick. The axhead weighs 17.4 g.



The axhead is a dark green in colour with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movment whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



This object seems to be echoing the style of the Early Palstave, Group III, Low flanged (Broad Bladed) axeheads and is very similar to the Wantage type and it's variants. This type has a broad blade and are decorated with a trident pattern, formed by short mouldings branching from the midrib out towards the corners of the stop. Schmidt (1981) writes that although broad bladed, unlooped palstaves are rare in the Marches and Wales there is enough with a trident pattern to view this area as a source for the type (p 133). He also mentions that unlooped, trident palstaves of Type Wantage are among the earliest broad bladed Palstaves to be produced (p 134). He gives a date for the Low flanged (broad blade) Palstaves beginning in the 14th century B.C and extending into the 13th, which puts it firmly in the Middle Bronze Age (1,600 B.C - 1000 B.C). Similar objects have been recorded in Schmidt (1981), Plate 59, Nos 801 - 808 and page 133. However these recorded examples are of larger Palstave axeheads. A direct comparison for a miniature Palstave of this type could not be found at the time of recording.

902633,Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A gold band with a narrow tang/fastening hook at one end and blunt rounded terminal at one end (with a roughly pierced hole to receive the fastening hook). Both sides of the ornament are folded over to create an overall [ shape (similar to other objects of this date and style, cf. the Binstead 'rings', discussed below). The object has been distorted and crumpled. It is not clear whether the damage occurred before or after deposition, but the latter is probable given the lack of clear or intentional breakage.



Dimensions:



In its current state the object has dimensions of 30mm by 23mm (length by breadth). Measure with a soft tape the object would have had a length of 70mm and a width of c.14-15mm.



Weight: 4.84g



Composition of the gold:



The composition of the gold was tested using non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis. It indicated a surface composition of approximately 88-90% gold and 9-11% silver, the rest being copper.



Discussion:

The function of this band is uncertain. It could be a ring or an ornament with another function. It share features in common with goldwork of probable Middle Bronze Age date, including the substantially larger Capel Isaf (Dyfed, Wales) armlets (Savory 1977), two small interlocked gold 'rings' found at Binstead (West Sussex) (Varndell 1998-9, 10-11, fig. 3) and the Woolaston (Gloucestershire) goldwork hoard (Treasure case 2013 T805, now in the British Museum).

This bead weighs 6.78g. It measures 15.9mm x 14.7mm transversely across the perforation and has a 'height', on the same axis as the perforation, of 9.9mm. The external surfaces of the bead are smooth, polished and undecorated. One side has a small irregular shaped depression at the mid point in the height. This area measures 4.7mm x height 3.1mm and is probably most likely to be the result of a casting imperfection rather than post-production damage.



The perforation is circular in shape with a diameter of 4.9mm on one side. On the opposing side the perforation has a diameter of 5.6mm. Much of the internal perforation wall is cylindrical with relatively vertical sides. However, on the side where there is an external surface depression, the perforation wall is significantly concave. This considerably reduces the thickness of the bead's wall at this location. An area of approximately 1.3mm diameter is so thin that it must have almost broken through to form a hole.



The metal is a relatively dark colour.

904134,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1150,"TREASURE CASE 2018 T373. Description: An incomplete strip of decorated gold, of probable Bronze Age dating (c. 2150 BC to c. 1150 BC). The strip is an oval/ellipse shaped band that tapers towards the possible terminals. The terminals have a corrugated appearance consisting of three or four peaks and troughs, each created length-ways for approximately one quarter of the object&#39;s length. The central section of the band is undecorated but, like the rest of the object, displays a number of scuffs and striations to both surfaces. There is evidence of a fold at either end of the corrugation and a third diagonal fold across the centre of the object. The finder reported that he unfolded the object himself, thinking at first that it was modern foil.

Dimensions: 53.3mm long, 13.3mm wide, 0.5mm thick, 3.5 grams.

Discussion: It is difficult to identify the object as a particular object type, although it may belong to a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments of Bronze Age date. A number of parallels have been recorded through the Portable Antiquities Scheme (Northfleet, Kent: Treasure Case 2004 T326, Brixton Deverill, Wiltshire: 2006 T250, Gussage-all-Saints, Dorset: 2013 T428, Roche, Corwall: 2014 T39 and Wantage, Oxon 2013 T674). As Dr S. Needham pointed out in the report for Brixton Deverill (2006 T250): &#39;a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings&#39;.

Conclusion: This fragment has a precious metal content of greater than 10% and is, on the balance of probabilities, of prehistoric date.

904784,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-750,"A fragment of cast copper-alloy spearhead, likely dating to the Middle Bronze Age (III) or Late Bronze Age - likely from the Wilburton, Blackmoor / Ewart Park phases. c.1200-750 BC.



Description: The fragment represents most of the spear's upper section and is missing only part of the point. It is long, tapering and narrowing, with a very high angular midrib flanked by moulded channels. The fragment is very warped and bent, typical of intentional 'killed' bronze age objects, leaving it almost S-shaped in profile. On one side of the edge there is another possible intentional bend. The break at the point and towards the butt end are both jagged but worn and patinated. At the butt end break it is shown to be hollow indicating it would have been socketed. The fragment is patinated a dark brown colour with very sparse tiny green speckles. There is a red concretion in parts of the moulded midrib channel.



Measurements: 95.96mm long, 20.35mm wide (at widest remaining), 9.86mm thick (at thickest remaining point) and 33.23g in weight.



Discussion: Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments 'Most Bronze Age spearheads are classified by blade shape or socket arrangements - so without those [there will be some uncertainty in classifying this example]. The blade is very large - given that this is just the upper part - so [dating cannot be narrowed further] than very late MBA (III) or LBA - Wilburton, Blackmoor / Ewart Park. so 1200-750. The blade though is very narrow and has a high mid-rib as well as raised flanking mouldings so would guess it is either a Davis Group 9 (1100 -975) Group 16 Lunate blade opening (1100- 800) or a Group 17 channelled blade (950-750). [It is likely that this fragment represents] the top 1/3 of the spearhead, [so when complete would have been a] massive one.



Matt Knight (pers. comms.) from National Museum Scotland has pointed out that the deformation of this object is certainly intentional and occurred when the object was heated, becoming plastic and then struck with a hammer causing some breakage but also the aforementioned deformation. This heated damage also explains why the breaks are not as jagged as one would expect from a cold break.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,33.23,,,9.86,95.96,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,Eastern,Essex,Braintree,Great Yeldham,TL7439,Generated from computer mapping software,52.0221296,0.53454026,KENT-68BED7,,KENT68BED7.jpg,Fragment of huge Bronze Age spear,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT68BED7.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1015821.jpg

The butt end is rectangular in form and triangular in cross section, with each face having a rectangular shaped recess with a raised border to contain the handle. The blade, which has an elongated triangular cross section, tapers in width from the point it joins the butt. Overall it is 20mm wide and rectangular in form, then flares out to form a curved cutting edge 28mm wide at its flared tip.

The axe has a green patina with green colouration in patches and there are various nicks along the length. The axe is 20mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away and the weight is 171.06g. The axe is warped and may have been miscast. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.

The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops but it has a midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group I type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC.

Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.

The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches

Description:



The fragment survives only as the blade end. The sides curve inwards from the curved crescent blade-edge, flaring in section to a rectangle. The break across the body is irregular. The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to dark brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety.

Description: The fragment survives only as the cutting edge and part of the long rectangular socketed body. The cutting edge survives intact, albeit heavily worn and runs in a very shallow convex curve, the blade tips flare slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaing body appears to be undecorrated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure althoguh part of a casting seam. The axhead is patinated a mid green and the breaks have lead to more extensive corrosion.

907145,Armlet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A copper alloy armlet or bracelet probably dating from the Later Bronze Age, about 1000 BC - 800 BC. It is a penannular loop with flared, expanding terminals. These are close together, leaving a gap of only about 4-6mm between them. Each terminal is circular and the ends are concave or hollow. The inner face of one terminal is rough and corroded and has gravel adhering to the concretion. The outer sides of the terminals are straight, flaring from the armlet hoop to the widest point of the terminals at the very end. The hoop is mainly D shaped in cross section and varies in diameter. It is c.12mm diameter immediately behind the terminals, swelling to c.18mm diameter at the side of the hoop opposite the terminals. The overall plan is D-shaped, the terminals being in the middle of the straight edge. It has been suggested that the original shape of the bracelet has been changed, as the terminals are unusually close to each other. There are some short shallow grooves on the inside of the hoop, near one of the terminals, and parallel to the end of the terminal. These are worn and patinated. The surface is mainly smooth and worn, with a few small pits, and has a turquoise green patina, with some areas of golden olive green. The armlet is 113.4mm long, 88.8mm wide (from terminals to the outer side of the hoop) and 24mm thick across the terminals. The internal measurements are 83.2mm long and 48.6mm wide from the terminal to the inner edge of the apex. 362g. The artefact was recovered from a quarry and has been through a washing plant where it would have been scrubbed with sand. This may account for the smooth, worn surface, but the fact that not all the patina has been removed suggests that it was a well developed patina originally. The small areas of olive green colouration may indicate the original colour.



This object could also be a Post Medieval to Modern West African manilla or currency bar such as WMID-22DE66, LANCUM-41B6C5 or LIN-E37002, but all of these previously recorded on the PAS database have solid, teardrop shaped terminals, and a more open, horseshoe like shape in plan. However, it remains a possibility that this is a manilla of different style. The depth and uniformity of the patina argues against this interpretation.



A good parallel but in gold rather than copper alloy is HAMP-5E48D1. Photographs of the copper alloy armlet were sent to several specialists. Adam Gwilt (National Museum of Wales) suggested that there is a tendancy for bronze versions of objects that are usually gold to be more common in Western and Northern Britain and provided a reference that touches on this: Gwilt et al (2005) A Late Bronze Age Hoard from Trevalyn Farm, Rossett, Wrexham, with Some Obvervations on Hoarding Practice and Gold Bracelet Weights"" in Studia Celtica XXXIX (2005), pages 27 - 61. He also noted that the squashed oval form looked atypical and suggested that the terminals may have been pushed inwards, perhaps deliberately before deposition. He suggested that the shape of the terminals are possible for the Late Bronze Age, though this example has chunky proportions.



Julia Farley (British Museum) agreed that the patina was plausibly Bronze Age or Iron Age, and Neil Wilkin (British Museum) was also prepared to entertain a Late Bronze Age date, citing a pair of slightly more slender copper alloy pennannular bracelets with expanded terminals recovered in a cache of Late Bronze Age (Ewart Park / Carp's Tongue) metalwork at Minster in Thanet, Kent which were excavated in 2010 - 2011 (MOLA Excavation Report: 'Prehistoric and Roman settlement at Tothill Street, Minster in Thanet, Kent' downloaded from www.kentarchaeology.org.uk). He did point out that the terminals are closer together than the Thanet examples, and the shape is more kidney-shaped.



In conclusion, this object is likely to be a Late Bronze Age armlet that has been distorted, perhaps deliberately, and one that has been made in copper alloy rather than the more usual gold.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Other chance find,2018-05-21T23:00:00Z,2018-05-21T23:00:00Z,,,362,,,24,113.4,1,Amy Downes,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Harrogate,North Stainley with Sleningford,SE3076,From finder,54.17891154,-1.54186705,SWYOR-B6E981,,3171_Armlet_1.jpg,Late Bronze Age armlet,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/3171_Armlet_1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1017687.jpg

907324,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"A very worn and incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age date (c. 2200 - 2000 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub triangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slightly tapering edges. In cross section the axe is rectangular. One long edge is curved and the opposite is relatively flat. 



The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present; it has been lost through abrasion. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. However, almost all of the original patina has been lost through laminating corrosion.  The axe is a mid green colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present. The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). Closest parallel is no 67, discovered at Hill of Finglenny. The axe is similar in size to HESH-ACD6C1 which is described as potentially small in length. 



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

The axe head comprises a curved, fan shaped cutting edge, which has suffered damage and corrosion. This tapers back in a curve to the stop ridge, before levelling out to form the rest of the axe. There is a prominent vertical rib running down the centre of the blade on both faces, from the stop ridge, to within approximately 20mm from the blade's edge, this is mirrored by two slighter ribs running either side, along the blades edges. Casting seams are visible along both sides of the axe head. Just below the stop ridge are traces of where the loop would have been situated. Below the stop ridges, on either side, are very slight flanges, which taper and then disappear towards the butt of the object. The area between these flanges is slightly curved in profile, with trace of an unidentied material on one side. Areas of the axe head are delaminating, with flaking on parts of the surface.","

Sub-rectangular copper-alloy sheet with three riveted holes spaced approximately 5.6-5.8mm apart from one another. It is likely that this item (along with no 9) forms part of a fitting, possibly a pommel fitting. There is one straight unbroken edge, and a curving edge which shows evidence of breakage on one side. The underside is worn and slightly concave, curving inward closer to the edges. The upper surface is smooth with a dark green patina. It was considered that this could be part of the shaft of a socketed knife, but the straight edge and the relative thinness of the artefact would suggest a plate fitting function, rather than being a fragment of a cylindrical item.

Copper-alloy socketed gouge or chisel of Late Bronze Age date. The tool is rounded at the butt portion though a rectangular shaped section is still visible, particularly when viewing the inside of the artefact. At the butt end the corners are much more rounded. Tapering toward the chisel point, the corners of the rectangular shaped tool become much more defined. The wider sides taper to a sharp triangular point, which meet the terminal of the shorter sides perpendicularly, forming a straight edge, creating a wedge like, sharp terminal. The socket rim is slightly flared and thicker on the edge. The external patina is dark green and generally smooth.

The spear can probably be assigned to Davis's Group 7 'Special Side Looped'. The object has a broken blade of indented quadrilateral section. There is a prominent longitudinal mid-rib on both sides of the spear blade and abraded cutting edges. Approximately one third of the blade has been broken off. The socketed end of the spear measures 15.76mm in diameter. The single side loop towards the base of the socketed end has since broken away. There is a hole on one face of the object in the centre of the of the blade wings at the base, which appears to have been formed through corrosion in antiquity. Much of the original surface has corroded and is lost; however, that which survives has a dark brown patina. The remainder of the object has a mottled dark-mid green patina.

The chape is sub triangular or ogival in shape, and lozenge shaped in cross section. At the open end the chape curves upwards into two convex arms, creating a crescent shape. The outside edges curve down gradually to half way down the chape, before narrowing at a more steep angle. The chape terminates with a rounded knop, at the end of which is a circular hole and rivet to attach the knop. Running down the centre of the chape on both sides is a raised ridge, this slopes gradually down to the edge of the chape, this is raised round the outside edge of the object. On both sides at half-length there is a circular perforation to the right of the raised central ridge. The inside of the chape is hollow.

910010,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy palstave axe dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. BC 1600-1400). The palstave is near-complete with only part of the broken butt missing. The palstave is roughly sub-rectangular in shape and flattens and flares outwards to form a wide rounded blade, giving the object a slender elongated sub-oval shaped cross-section. The butt is H-shaped in section and terminates towards the centre of the axe with shallow rounded stop-ridge and a peltate-shaped recess on both sides at right angles to the septum. The flanges are flat, sub-oval in plan, straight and parallel and extend all the way to the butt, with a central longitudinal casting ridge, one with a flattened globular miscast patch towards the cutting edge. The blade gradually flattens and to form a wide cutting edge that is heavily worn and pitted. One side of the blade is heavily pitted and scratched and has patches of green patina and iron-corrosion across sections of the flange and especially the recessed section of the butt. The opposite side of the axe is less corroded but has a wide diagonal scratch extending from the cutting edge to the adjacent flange.



The palstave axe measures 142mm in length. The blade is 61mm wide and 2mm thick at the cutting edge and the butt 22mm wide and 10mm thick and its end, and 22mm wide and 26mm thick at the stop. The axe weighs 325.13 grams.



This palstave shares characteristics with Group 1 Primary Shield Pattern palstaves from the Acton Park 1 of Bronze Age metalwork (as of Schmidt & Burgess 1981).

910443,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A small copper alloy, perhaps miniature or 'model', Middle Bronze Age palstave axehead of Schmidt and Burgess 'unclassified low-flanged palstave' type with broad blade (group III) and without side loop, belonging to the Taunton phase of metalworking and corresponding to Needham's period 5, 1500-1150 BC. The flanges are a little worn (old damage) but the object is otherwise complete.

From the central stop ridge (13.5mm wide, 13.3mm thick) the blade has gently expanding straight sides, curving into a broad but flattish cutting edge 19.8mm wide (with possible old damage to one corner). Directly below the stop ridge on one face is a small hole 1.7mm deep, probably a bubble from the casting process. Below and running to the cutting edge are faint traces of a worn and wideish mid-rib. There are possible traces of this to the other face but it is not certain.

Above the stop ridge the butt end widens a little and narrows to 14.9mm x 1.9mm at the end, which is worn. The stop ridge projects 3.7mm above the butt end on either side.

The object measures 74.5mm in length, 19.9mm in max.width, 13.2mm in max.thickness and weighs 46.96g. The metal is dark grey in colour with some green patches, and is pitted on both faces. No casting flashes are visible to the sides of the object.

It is uncertain whether this object is a miniature axe intended for use (it seems rather small for axe-purpose but could have functioned as a wood-working too perhaps) or perhaps had use as a votive object; it is larger though in its 'model' form similar to miniature socketed axes (for eg. HAMP-657353) thought to have an amulet or votive function and believed to date between the Bronze Age to the Roman period (Robinson, P; 1995).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,46.69,,,13.2,74.5,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South East,Hampshire,East Hampshire,Rowlands Castle,SU7212,From finder,50.90299451,-0.97743794,HAMP-C8A4F8,,HAMPC8A4F8.jpg,Middle Bronze Age miniature palstave,Hampshire Cultural Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPC8A4F8.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1020417.jpg

One face and two sides of the axehead retain much of the original shiny, smooth olive green-brown soloured patina. Elsewhere, where the patina is lost, the metal is rough, heavily pitted, and a blueish-green in colour. 

The blade is triangular in shape, the long edges a little in-curved and the cutting edge expanded (51.2mm wide). Visible on the face retaining its original patina, the cutting edge is bevelled and above this are shallow hammer markings/ workings. There is a little damage to one end of the cutting edge.

The stop ridge measures 24.2mm wide and 32.3mm in depth. Below this, and continuing as a line from the flange edges above, a rib on either side converges in a point at the top of the blade to give a triangular shield-shape. Just below the stop ridge, the top of the blade is waisted and measures 22.5mm wide and 24.5mm thick.

Above the stop ridge the flange edges running along the butt end of the axe slope upwards to a point c. one third of the way along the butt end before sloping downwards again for another third of the length where the flange becomes level with the butt end. At their highest point, the flanges have a depth of 36.9mm; however only one of these points survives undamaged so it is likley the original depth was c.38mm. Originally, the flanges would have had a distinctive lozengiform shape. To one side of the axehead these are badly damaged and motly missing (old damage). The butt end is 19.4mm wide and 6.6mm thick. One corner is missing (old damage).

To the sides of the axehead the casting flashes are visible in places, worn smooth. To one side, a pair of longitudinal grooves are visible just below the butt end. It is uncertain whether these are decorative or the remant of a worn casting flash.

The length from the butt end to the stop ridge is c.61mm. It is max.14.1mm deep (behind the stop-ridge - there is also a deepish hole at this point, a possible casting flaw) and 15.8mm wide inside the flanges behind the stop.

The axehead measures 145.1mm in length, max. 51.2mm wide (cutting edge) and 36.9mm thick (stop ridge). It weighs 384g (to the nearest 2g).

The palstave has an old, irregular break at the butt. The septum is gradually thickens from 3.0 mm at the butt to 7.4 mm before the stop. The septum is 54.2 mm in length and 24.4 mm in width. The flanges gradually widen from the butt to the stop to a maximum of 31.4 mm on one side and 29.6 mm on the other side, creating a triangular shape in profile. The stop is angled forwards slightly at its centre and is thicker than the flanges at the centre at 31.3 mm. An integral loop survives on one side and measure 21.9 mm in length. The loop starts before the widest part of the flange and continues towards the blade side. On the other side, diametrically opposite to the loop and near to the flange top, is a shallow hole. The hole measure 4.7 mm in the inner diameter.



The elongated, narrow blade is sub-rectangular in section with curved sides that widen gradually towards the blade, before curving out at the blade tips to meet the convex curve of the blade edge. The blade thins from the stop to the edge. The broad faces of the blade are noticeable convex with a central ridge projecting down the blade from the stop. The blade is 62.0 mm in length from the stop ridge to the cutting edge and 21.7 mm in width across the stop ridge. The cutting edge is 35.9 mm in width and 2.8 mm in thickness, it is chipped and any edge bevel is now unclear.



The palstave appears plain and with a green-brown patina all around. Traces of the original surface remains on the loop, on the stop ridge and on one side of the blade.



The palstave measures 123.8 mm in length and weights 245.9 g.



The palstave dates in general to the Middle Bronze Age. The side loop and a much narrower blade tending towards oval in cross section suggest a late dating, from BC 1300 to 1150. A similar example from Salcombe, Devon (Knight, Ormod, Pearce 2015, no. 163b) is dated along with other materials from AC 1300 to 1150.

The object is a butt riveted small blade dagger or knife with triangular blade. The blade would have been attached to the hilt by means of three large rivets, the top side one is still in place. The rivet is circular in cross-section and flat-hourglass-shaped in plan. The other two are missing and the other rivet holes are incomplete due to breaks or possibly corrosion. The object is quite damaged so it is difficult to ascertain the exact type, but it is similar to Needham's series 2 (id 1200 Carder Low Type 2B or 1204 Parsley Hay Type 2A) or a series 7 (ID 1260 Thomas Hardye School Type 1 B4/7A). The condition of the object is reasonably good. It is patinated dark green/brown with damage to the blade and the top is missing. The length is 50mm, the width is 28mm (photos from finder).



Similar in form to SF9298 though larger which itself is similar to examples from Shrewton, Wilts (associated with a pommel and a beaker) and Driffield, Yorks which was associated with a beaker, stone wristguard with gold rivet caps and two amber buttons.



EBA daggers are rare in the north (and very rare in the northwest) - and are high status EBA funerary artefacts usually found in barrows (Ben Roberts pers com 24.07.18).

The axe in length is 148mm, the width is 55mm thickness 55mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.

The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops or midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group II type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC.

Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.

The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches

Description: The fragment survives only as the blade end. The sides begin to curve inwards from the curved crescent blade-edge, flaring in section to a rectangle. The broken edges are heavily worn likely indicate breakage in antiquity although the variation in patination may indicate it happen while in the ground. The break across the body is irregular. The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to light brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety. It looks like it was not faceted or had a ribbed decoration.

916046,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Copper alloy socketed axe head. Cast socketed single looped axe head, lightly flared towards its crescentic curved cutting edge. The plain narrower upper and lower sides each bear a clear central mould line; the other broader sides are flat and plain. At c.50mm in from the cutting edge, narrow grooves of width c.4.5mm appear at the arises where flat sides meet, and these continue until 5mm before the edge of the socket. This appears square with rounded corners externally, framing a rounded aperture measuring 27mm in both directions and with a thickened triangular section border. A single loop of length 17.5mm, width 6.5mm and height [i.e. protrusion] 7mm is set on one narrower side adjacent to the socket, with the mould line noted above continuing along it. Most of the object bears an appealing brownish patina; this has suffered only limited disruption by localised damage on one broader side, and is more extensively removed from the other, where a deeper dent also appears, presumably the result of plough strike. A chocolate brown material with an orange tinted stain where it is lost appears around the inner side of the mouth of the socket, and might even represent the otherwise decayed wood of a haft. The cutting edge remains sharp. The thickened socket mouth, which is amply reinforced at the point which would receive more stress than any other, adds to the general impression of a viable tool which remained fully functional at the time of its deposition. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC.

916429,Strap Fitting,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1600,-100,"A complete copper-alloy strap fitting of possible middle Bronze Age to Iron Age date, c. 1600 - 100 BC.



The object comprises a pointed ovate body with a D-shaped section which tapers in thickness from one end to the other. The upper terminal is swollen with a wide, rounded upper end which is decorated with two parallel incised D-shaped borders. The front of the swollen portion of the body has a central lozenge shaped recess extending from the point at which the two borders meet on the upper edge to midway along the front of the body. The recess is at its widest where the body bends from the rounded top to the front. The sides of the body curve inward slightly as they extend and narrow to form the rounded lower terminal.



An integral rectangular attachment loop is present to the reverse of the wide upper terminal and the reverse of the fitting is slightly concaved.



The metal has a dark green patina and is worn. The object is 25.3mm long, 16.3mm wide, 9.8mm thick (17.6mm with attachment loop) and weighs 11.6g.



This fitting has features in common with a fairly frequently found yet poorly understood object type currently known simply as 'moustache' or 'moustache-like' objects. See: YORYM-9432BB, LIN-9296A3, WMID-CA9D04 and BH-037A57. Such objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the early Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard. Dr JD Hill (British Museum) suggests that they are Iron Age objects, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.



SUR-29CED6 and SUR-4F8D51 are more similar to the current example. While both are described as 'a fragment of a moustache object' they appear to be complete.

917277,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1125,"A nearly complete cast copper alloy spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age (1400 BC - 1125 BC).



The spear blade is leaf shaped, with loops incorporated into the base. This is known as a basal-looped spearhead. The blade is now broken into two pieces, roughly half way down with a diagonal break. Most of the outer edge of the blade is abraded, except around the tip where it is complete. The centre of the blade is divided by an expanding (tip to base) lozenge sectioned midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear. Conjoined at the base of the blade are two oval shaped loops. When viewed in profile, the outer edges of the loops (loop plates) are lozenge shaped. The socket is conical in shape, the lower edge of which is slightly damaged and missing a small section. There is remains of wood inside the socket.



The metal is dark brown in colour, with an uneven but polished patina. The tip is 98.6 mm long, 33.9 mm wide and 13.9 mm thick at the midrib. The second piece is 172.7 mm long and 39.4 mm wide. The base of the socket is 23.9 mm by 22.5 mm. The tip weighs 57.6 g and both pieces together weigh 191 g.



Middle Bronze Age spearheads have been categorised by Davis (2017) and this example falls into Group 8: Incorporated basal looped. He notes that spearheads of the later MBA were generally larger, as well as having loops at the base of the blade. They are dated by associated to the Taunton and Penard phases (1400 BC - 1125 BC).



Further examples have also been recorded on the PAS database, including BERK-AAB536, HESH-CB1BF7, SF-54C472 and DENO-DC8D26.

Discussion:

The objects that make up this find are all typical of Ewart Park phase hoards (c. 900-800 BC) in the south-east of England. The composition of the hoard and the scrap-like (fragmentary) condition of the objects is comparable to others found in Kent (see Turner 2010 for fexamples). The shape and size of ingot (No. 1) is notable and relatively unusual, as is the presence of a bracelet fragment (No. 30), although it can be paralleled, for example, in the hoard from Minnis Bay, Isle of Thanet (Ibid.).

Conclusion: 

As a single find of more than two prehistoric objects of copper alloy, this find (consisting of objects Nos. 1-30) qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002","Please note that soil adhered to many of the objects and the weights cannot be taken as final.&nbsp;

The larger fragment comprising roughly a quarter of the upper shaft is broadly trapezoidal in plan and wedge-shaped in profile. The axe has a double mouth moulding which is very worn. The surviving body of the axe is broadly rectangular with gently tapering sides. On one face there is a semi-circular shaped loop with an oval perforation infilled with deposition residue. The fragment is broken along the upper casting seam but unevenly along the other sections of the body. The fragment measures 40mm in length, a maximum of 26mm in width at the socket end and is 5.5mm thick. It weighs 27.80 grams.



The smaller fragment is a broken section of the axe's sub-square shaped socketed body. The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan and broadly rectangular in section, and is angled at one end. The small fragment does not attatch in any obvious way to the larger fragment but the material and composition indicate that they are both from the same object.

918540,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"A complete copper alloy miniature flat axe or possibly a chisel, 59.5mm in length and dating to the early to late early Bronze Age (2050 BC- 1700BC).



The axe has straight sides, expanding into a cutting edge, which is curved and 26mm across, with a cutting edge around 1mm thick. The butt end narrows to 15.1mm in width and is slightly convex. There are no flanges or other features. The profile of the axe is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval with a maximum thickness at the centre of 7.3mm. The surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy - suggesting a date after the very earliest period when axes were made of copper rather than bronze","This object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg.HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).



Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.

918988,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"A gold-plated copper alloy penannular 'lock ring' of Late Bronze Age date. The ring consists of a central core in copper alloy covered by sheets of gold: one on the front and the back of the ring and one on the inner side. This inner sheet is now detached from the core and irregularly folded, whilst the edges of the first sheet on one side are lifted. The gold sheet is decorated on both surface with seven concentric incised lines following the shape of the ring.



The ring is C-shaped in plan with a gap of 2.7 mm. It is and triangular in cross-section, with a flat inner side, flat surfaces and a prominent external rim. It is worn with several blackened spots along the sheets of gold.



The ring measures 24.9 mm in diameter and weighs 5.01 g.



Gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) and they could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. They are usually decorated with repousse' decoration or with fine concentric incised lines imitating fine wire works. More rarely, lock-rings are made from plates obtained from individual gold wires soldered together.



A close parallel is BERK-4A433E (2016 T106) dating to 1150-800 BC. Another similar parallel but without copper alloy core is no. W.20 in British Museum Collection, dating to BC 1150-750.","This item was found before 1996 and therefore as there is no evidence it was buried with the intention to recover it would not be classed as Treasure under the pre-1996 law (ie the law of Treasure Trove).

920359,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1300,"A complete cast copper-alloy flanged axehead, dating from the Early to Middle Bronze Age (c.1400-1250 BC). This object is probably a Schmidt and Burgess Type Ulrome, No. 542 (1981: plate 43).



The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow, squared butt end which is wedge-shaped in section, tapering at the terminal. There are four individual flanges, on the front and back of the axehead and either side. The flanges start near the butt end, where they gradually curve upwards in profile and are thicker in section towards the crest. The crest of the flanges are a rounded point. After the crest, each flange becomes thicker in section and slopes downwards in profile, more abruptly compared to the other side of the crest. This side of each flange is curved inwards to the centre of the object, with a slight internal ridge. On the exterior profile of the flanges, on both sides of the axehead, there are two lengthwise ridges which run along the base of each flange, tapering towards the butt end. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body of the axehead. Although there is a lack of a defined stop ridge to secure the handle, there is a slight ridge which starts at the end of the thicker, curved side of the flanges and it is curved towards the butt end. This curved ridge is more apparent on one side of the axehead than the other, due to the level or corrosion on this object. The side with the more clear curved ridge, also has two ridges which start at the end of the flanges and form a point, facing the blade end of the object. These ridges, along with the curved ridge, form a triangle with a curved base shape on the body of the axehead. After the flanges, the body of the axehead gradually widens in plan and curves outwards, relatively close to the terminal of the blade end. The section of the body gradually tapers towards the blade end. The plan of the blade is crescent shaped and is chipped in several places along the blade edge.



The axehead is in a fair condition, with most of the detail and dark green patina being visible. The surface of the object is pitted with evidence of active bronze disease and has some patches of orange-brown.



It is 132.81mm in length, 47.33mm in width at the blade end, 22.27mm in width at the butt end, 30.84mm thick at the flanges and 13.48mm thick at the mid-pont of the body.



Another flanged axehead which is similar to this object was recorded by the Durham Portable Antiquities Scheme: DUR-41AE2E. Other examples on the PAS database include: IOW-DC1AD8; LANCUM-B39815; SWYOR-BAA720; and DENO-D22101. This axehead is possibly Schmidt and Burgess Type Ulrome, with No. 542 being the closest parallel as it has the same profile shape and has similar ridges on the body, a triangle with a curved base, as well as the ridges on the side of the flanges match this object (1981: plate 43).

Octagonal-sectioned socketed handle with two rivet holes positioned on the long axis on each face, now filled with corossion product. Within the socket is a fragment of wood, traces of a white substance, possibly adhesive (or wax) and a ring of corrosion product running around the mouth. The handle tapers slightly from a width of 25.5mm to 21.5mm before expanding into the shoulders to a maximum width of 42.1mm. The junction between the integrally cast blade and the hilt is stepped on both faces, with a central U-shaped cut out in the centre of the hilt. The blade tapers in width along its length from 41.2mm to 25mm, terminating in a transverse break. It has a lenticular cross-section with a pronounced median rib on both faces. The long edges are heavily abraded. The sword exhibits a smooth dark brown patina, with green patination along the edges, around the area of the break and areas which appear to have been abraded due to movement in the plough soil.

The object is a single cast chisel with a flat terminal that widens towards the middle of the piece before tapering down to a point. The wider end terminates in a worn break, and is slightly bent inwards. The point is likely the tang of the object to be inserted into a wooden handle, and is roughly square in section. There is a slightly thicker collar below the tang. The object is undecorated, is mid to dark green in colour and has an uneven patina. Abrasion, caused by movement within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some original surface detail.



Small chisels and tools of this type were used for an extensive period of time, not simply in the Bronze Age, but also in later periods for jewellery making and fine work. As such dating the object is difficult.

Discussion



Similar examples recorded on the PAS database include: BERK-CCF74B; NMGW-FE5523; and BERK-CF2C22. 



Owing to the size of the fragment it in unclear what type of blade this object was attributed to and how long the original item would have been. However, as Domscheit (2014) discusses, 'Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered'.

921483,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been circular in plan and plano-convex in profile. This fragment is square in plan, triangular in profile, and rectangular in section, as it comes from one edge of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers' hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan, sub-rectangular in profile, and triangular in section. The fragment is hollow with an internal triangular recess tapering to a point towards the cutting edge. The edges and faces of the axehead fragment are smooth and precise. The break is uneven and runs diagonally down the body of the axehead. Unfortunately not enough remains of the axehead to be able to identify it more precisely or attribute a closer date.

921640,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-950,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) palstave axe with side loop and three decorative ribs. It is most probably from the period 1050-950 BC which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the later Middle and earlier Late Bronze Age; this corresponds with Needham (1996) Period 5-6 fitting with Metalworking Assemblage X. The axe is relatively diminutive (small) when compared to most palstaves being broadly rectangular in plan and ovoid in profile. The blade of the palstave has straight sides that flare to form a crescent shaped cutting edge. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete; although only a small part has probably been lost. The two sides flare progressively from the butt to the raised and thickened stop. The flanges are fused to the stop and the septum of the axe is smooth and undecorated. The casting seams and associated flashes on either side (long edge) have been trimmed and hammered flat. An integrally cast side loop descends on one edge; it is positioned astride the stop. The loop is D-shaped in cross-section. Below the stop ridge of the axe on the upper blade are three ribs - a central one and two tapering ones; these descend from the thickened stop and taper to an undefined edge at the mid-part of the upper blade. The ribs are present on both faces - although are better defined on one. The palstave has a well-defined polished mid-green coloured surface patina which is relatively well preserved. A small amount of surface abrasion and corrosion is present - mostly limited to the external edges. The break across the butt is patinated with a slightly lighter green patina suggesting damage in antiquity but more recent than deposition. More recent plough damage is visible on each surface but especially on the cutting edge, the loop and one face of the blade.



The palstave axe fits well with those known from the later period - most specifically defined as 'later palstaves' due to its size it is difficult to align it with a sub type - although it does have the majority of the traits identified as Type Isleham or more probably Type Nettlesham (after Burgess & Schmidt). This type is relatively uncommon with only a few examples being recorded on the PAS database. Good parallels can be seen from Hockenhul, Cheshire (LVPL-B27017) and also a mixed hoard of Late palstaves and socketed axes from Amport, Hampshire (HAMP-4DE734 etc). The nature of this hoard suggests this form of decorated axe has a potentially long life (well into the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (1000-750 BC).



The palstave measures: 152.5mm length, is 44.3mm width across the blade, 20.5mm width across the butt, the axe is 36.4mm thick across the stop and the septum is 6.7mm thick at the butt. The side flanges raise to a height of 6.7mm above the septum and the stop is 11.7mm.

The blade tip is missing, the socket and base of the blade remain, the blade terminating in an old break 30.8 mm from the blade-socket junction. The midrib is lozenge-shaped in cross-section. On either side of the midrib are deep channels. The blade wings are broadly triangular in cross-section.. The ribs do not extend onto the socket. The socket is circular in cross-section, it tapers slightly from 22 mm at the base to 19 mm at the blade socket junction, where it becomes more eliptical in cross-section. Near the rim of the socket are the broken lugs for two loops placed roughly opposite each other, in line with the blade wings. The tip of the wooden shaft of the spear survives in the socket. The object has a pitted surface and a olive green/brown patina with light green and brown patches.



Overall length 92 mm, width 31 mm, thickness 10.5 mm, Weight 80.8 g.



Stylistically, the spearhead fits into Davis Group 2 Socketed Type B Looped. Richard Davis says: ""The key attributes ... are the V-shaped base to the blade as it merges with the socket. The midrib does not follow the line of the socket, but is narrower than the socket as it enters the V. There is a channel each side of the midrib as it leads to the raised blade wings. The loops are low on the socket. There is a characteristic inward curve of the profile from above the socket to the blade. ... These spearheads represent the first stage of combining the blade with the socket. They are dated to the Arreton Phase 1700-1550 BC based on hoard evidence. Finds of Group 2 spearheads are rare. [Davis'] PBF catalogue comprises 8 with pegholes and 22 with loops. The only local finds from the Group are one with a peghole, dredged from the River Trent at Colwick (Castle Museum collection): and one with loops purchased from a car boot sale and believed to have come from the Trent gravels (DENO-DC4C87)."" pers. comm. 31/10/2018.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,80.8,,,10.5,92,1,Simon Nicholson,Simon Nicholson,East Midlands,Nottinghamshire,Newark and Sherwood,Langford,SK8356,From finder,53.09476293,-0.7619784,DENO-0A5A41,,DENO0A5A41.jpg,Middle Bronze Age Ribbed Kite Blade spearhead,Derby Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENO0A5A41.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1032415.jpg

Discussion:



The earliest bronze hammers were created in the Middle Bronze Age Taunton metalwork phase, however hammer finds are more defined in Late Bronze Age hoard discoveries. Socketed hammers became more widespread in the Penard phase (c1200-950BC), and according to Burgess this tradition lasted longer in the North of Britain whereas the characteristics of the Wilburton Phase were prominent in southern Britain during the tenth century BC. Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart-Park Phase which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800BC. Burgess (1968) describes two socketed hammers from the Kilnhurst hoard in Yorkshire, one short and the other long which is similar to the example here. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding. The example described here is more likely a later example in the Penard Phase. Burgess also parallels Penard metalwork to continental examples and in particular western France.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,51.7,,,13.11,61.48,1,Ellie Cox,Ellie Cox,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,South Northamptonshire,Hartwell,SP8051,From finder,52.15149812,-0.83215728,NARC-5B738E,,NARC5B738E.jpg,NARC-5B738E : Hammer : Bronze Age,Eleanore Cox,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC5B738E.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1030945.jpg

This fragment is square in plan, triangular in profile, and rhomboidal in section, as it comes from one edge of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers' hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The object is now sub rectangular in form and oval in cross section, it is a sheet that has been rolled around itself at least four times and appears to be incomplete. At the visible end it is 14mm wide and very thin less than 0.25mm thick. It is decorated with a series of seven raised rectangular cross sectioned ridges set within a plain flat border visible on one edge, 2mm wide. The sheet narrows and has probably been trimmed, as where it folds under itself it is 12mm wide and here it has six raised ridges present and the lower one disappears off the edge with no border.

The blade is a elongated sub-triangle with concave sides and a convex blade edge. The corners of the blade are flared outwards and are abraded and therefore rounded. The blade as it tapers becomes rectangular in section. At the tip there is an integral rectangular sectioned collar with a fragment of the integral tang protruding from the upper edge. The break of the tang is not recent. There are no signs of decoratio.



The surface of the chisel has a incomplete well-developed mid green patina with some pitting and abrasion.

Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example, dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase, is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) probably continuing into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC). A similar tanged chisel was found in association with a large amount of Late Bronze Age material as part of a probable Early Iron Age hoard at Gussage St. Michael, Dorset (Knight, Ormrod & Pearce 2015: 51, no. 250b).

It comprises a strip of sheet gold with worn transverse breaks at either end. Now bent approximately mid-way along its length at an obtuse angle, probably after deposition; the bend shows stress marks and there is a small tear at the apex.

The less numerous types include arm and possibly ear ornaments fastening by means of a hook at each end, or a hook and eye (piercing)… There are also an increasing number of (often) thin gold strips and fragments with terminal piercings which on grounds of composition could fit into a Bronze Age context. Again, there are continental analogues, beginning within the Early Bronze Age sheet gold tradition.”

The fragment dates from the Middle Bronze Age, but to be sure of its date, it will need more metallurgical analysis.



Rohl and Needham (1998) illustrate some similar rapiers with broad mid-ribs on p.132, fig.34, nos.189-190, which are Group IV rapiers, and date from the Penard phase of metalwork, c.1275-1150 BC. 



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate rapiers with narrow blades and broad mid-ribs from Sennen in Cornwall and Exmouth in Devon on p.98, pl.25, nos.71 & 134.



Dr Matt Knight's research has suggested that rapiers carried on in use over longer periods of time where early swords did not develop. This is true of Scotland, but also of the South West so it is possible to suggest that rapiers continued to be used in these areas into the Wilburton (c.1150-1020 BC) phase of the late Middle Bronze Age (Matt Knight pers comm).",,4,Copper alloy,,Undergoing further examination at a museum,Metal detector,2018-09-12T23:00:00Z,2018-09-12T23:00:00Z,,,31.39,,,5.5,75,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Gweek,SW7026,Generated from computer mapping software,50.08948628,-5.21680296,CORN-0A6EBC,,rapier.JPG,Group IV rapier fragment (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/rapier.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1034885.jpg
926829,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1850,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy flat axehead, comprising part of the blade, trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile and rectangular in section, at the narrow broken end, dating from the Early Bronze Age c.2200-1850 BC.. The opposite blade end tapers to a rounded and damaged edge in profile which may have expanded outwards to form the cutting edge. The blade is broad and straight sided but as it is worn and incomplete, may have expanded into a more crecentic cutting edge. The surface of the blade is covered with a brown patina and both faces are decorated with straight lines punched into the axe after casting, about 5mm in length, and about 1mm apart, in what is referred to as a 'rain pattern'. One face of the blade has a transverse gash where it has been damaged since deposition, which cuts through the outer layer, revealing the light green corroded surface beneath which is also exposed on parts of the edges. The blade may have been deliberately broken at the upper edge, before it thickens and potentially flanges outwards towards the butt end, as the break is straight and may have been struck with a chisel prior to deposition as it is now corroded and worn.



Comparable examples of decorated flat axeheads with more spaced out linear incisions from the Southwest can be found in Pearce (1983) on a Migdale flat axehead from Southleigh in Devon (pp.455 & 600, pl.39, no.297) and a low-flanged flat axehead from Mount Pleasant in Dorset (pp.468 & 609, pl.48, no.371). See also record CORN-C53643 where the decoration covers the whole axe and is more regular and evenly spaced like this example and the developed flat axehead from Preston Down, Weymouth (pp.487 & 621, pl.60, no.480).



Flat axes decorated with this 'rain pattern' without flanged sides can be found during the Mile Cross-Aylesford phase (c.2050-1850 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axes illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 124, fig.25, nos.47-48).

The sides of the axe were once straight but are now abraded and taper towards the narrow butt end which is worn to almost a point. The surface of the roughout has developed a dark brown patina and the sides have exposed the light green corrosion product beneath through wear and damage since deposition.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar rough flat axes with narrow butt ends and straight sides from Birnie, Morayshire and Angus in Scotland in plate 21, nos.258-259, which are unclassified but close to Type Migdale associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition c.2200-2000 BC of the Early Bronze Age.

927674,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1150,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy side-looped palstave, with just the upper butt end that would have been hafted remaining. The fragment is broken just above the stop ridge which would have stopped the wooden haft on both sides, and is missing its blade so it is difficult to classify, but from the shape and the side loop it likely dates from the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age. The broken edge is rectangular in section with the bases of the worn flanges, 4 mm in height, on both sides of the palstave and the butt is narrow and parallel-sided blade between these flanges in plan. The flanges taper as they move towards the butt end where they are flush with the surface. The blade would have expanded slightly below the missing stop ridge and terminated in a crescentic blade edge. The remains of half of the side loop project outwards 9 mm from the surface of one side of the palstave and the loop is 15 mm long. The surface of the blade is damaged and pitted but some smooth layers of mid-green patina have developed and there are patches of light green bronze disease.



If the stop ridge was squared off, perpendicular to the parallel-sided low flanges, then this butt end was probably part of a side-looped Transitional Type palstave, but we do not know if the blade was plain or decorated.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar palstaves with low side flanges, parallel sides and squared-off stop ridges from Yorkshire and Denwick in Northumberland in plates 62 & 64, nos.859 & 880, which are classified as Transitional Palstaves and dated from the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age.

The spearhead has a short but slender kite-shaped blade with rounded shoulders. The edges are bevelled and the blade is still very sharp. Fine filing or polishing striations can be seen all over both sides of the blade. The socket is circular and tapers from the open mouth in to the shaft between the blade's wings. There are two lozenge-shaped, undrilled 'loops' located equidistantly between the socket mouth and the blade. The mouth of the socket has slight damage in three areas, and a small hole (a casting flaw?) can be seen below one of the 'loops'. There are fine linear filing or finishing striations all over the length and circumference of the socket. These lines have been created by filing from opposing angles which has created triangular and cross-hatched patterns. Around the 'loops' are striations that follow the shape of each lozenge and overlies the cross-hatching, showing the filing of the loops was one of the last processes to be undertaken. Overall the spearhead is in extremely good condition. It appears to have no wear on it and it is possible it was made to be a votive deposit rather than a functional item.

A small number of similar spearheads with undrilled loops have recently been recorded from across Oxfordshire; from Kingston Bagpuize (BERK-5BCE29), from Cherwell (BERK-D20304), Bampton (BERK-44F126) and another example found in AD 1871 in Fyfield now in the Ashmolean Museum (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706).

In plan it is broadly triangular with straight sides tapering to a rounded, but now abraded point. It is very flat in cross section. The hilt end is badly damaged with the outer corners and the central tang all broken. The break has occurred across the three circular rivet holes, approximately 8.5mm in diameter, one on each corner, and the other in the centre of the tang. This one is positioned slightly further down into the hilt than those on the outer corners. These positions suggest that the tang was slightly convex in shape. One of the side rivets remains in situ, with the other two found loose nearby.



The rivets are circular in cross section with expanded convex heads at either end, and vary in length from 14.4mm - 14.9mm, and in width from 9.8mm - 10.5mm. The weight of the two detached rivets, 5.60g and 5.15g.

This fragment weighs 25.20g and is from the distal butt-end of the blade. The fragment has a pointed-oval to shallow lozenge shaped cross-section and all of the edges are worn. The fragment has an incomplete length of 38.6mm, maximum width of 35.1mm at approximately 20.6mm in from the butt-end and maximum thickness of 4.6mm. The butt-end is a relatively straight line with rounded corners and width of 29.5mm. The fragment's sides angle inwards, tapering towards, the now missing, blade tip. The blade has a, slightly diagonal, very worn transverse break and a width of 23.2mm. The break of slope on the change of angle along the edges, on both sides, of the blade is c.8.5mm in from the edges. Two circular rivet holes are present at the butt-end. One is positioned 4.5mm in from the butt-end and 1.9mm in from the side edge. This aperture has a diameter of 6.9mm. The other rivet hole is positioned 6.9mm in from the butt-end and 0.8mm in from the side edge. Being so close to the edge the metal between the aperture and edge has broken and the metal has pulled apart, one break above the other, creating a gap of 0.6mm. A rivet remains in place through this hole. The rivet has a sub-circular cross-section with a diameter of 6.5mm, which fits securely into the aperture, and length of 11.1mm. The rivet has a shallow domed head which expands slightly from the diameter of the shaft, probably due to being hammered on both sides to secure the rivet in place thus to hold the blade to the hilt. The head has a more oval diameter of 7.1mm x 6.4mm the head at the other end of the rivet measuring 7.1mm x 6.9mm. Peter Reavill suggests that the condition of the mushroom headed rivets is likely to indicate that the hilt was still attached to the blade when it went into the ground.

The cross sectional profile is flat, slightly elliptical but without a prominent midrib. The trapezoidal tang is splayed and relatively wide (6.5mm) compared to the overall width of the head (12.6mm).","The only example of this type of bronze arrowhead from a securely dated archaeological context comes from the Penard hoard (c. 1275-1140 BC) and was published in Archaeologica 71 (p. 138). At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import on the basis of a range of previous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France. PAS recorded finds have since demonstrated that these bronze arrowheads were also a native British tradition, although they are very rare finds. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age, the Penard find suggests at least a Middle Bronze Age date for copper alloy examples such as this one which likely derive their shape from these earlier flint precursors.

Description: The fragment survives only as the cutting edge and part of the long rectangular socketed body. The cutting edge survives intact, albeit heavily worn. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips flare slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible .

933886,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"An incomplete copper-alloy side-looped spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1550 - 1125 BC. It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). 



The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced triangular cross-sectioned mid-rib on both faces, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. The edges of the blade are irregular and highly fragmentary due to corrosion. Some trace of edge bevels are discernable along parts of the blade edge, but it is hard to distinguish these from areas of corrosion. At the base of the blade is a socket, which is rectangular in plan, circular in cross-section, and is hollow, with no trace of wood remaining inside. Corrosion has created several holes in the sides of the socket. The socket has cast side loops roughly half way along its length, which are fragmentary.



The spearhead is green and brown in colour and in poor condition. All surfaces of the object are pitted and have copper disease, and the edges of the object are very fragile. The spearhead is 154.1mm in length, 35.9mm in width, 22.3mm thickness, and weighs 102.2g. 



This object corresponds closely with Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'. For this group, the most numerous of all Early and Middle Bronze Age spearheads, Davis suggests a chronology corresponding with the Acton Park and Taunton phases, about 1550 - 1250 BC.

The spearhead has a leaf shaped blade, with a pronounced and rounded midrib ridge which runs to the tip of the spear. The tip is now worn and broken, as are the edges of the blade. The blade and midrib cross section is lozenge shaped. The socket is circular in cross section and hollow.



The loops are about half way down the socket of the spearhead, these are formed of a narrow rectangular loop plate on both sides. The loops are D shaped in cross section, with an oval perforation. Running along the edges close to the loops are raised casting seams. The socket flares out towards the terminal edge, which is now worn and broken. One part has been folded inwards, and another part is folded outwards.



The spearhead has a dark green patina, with small circular patches of light green on the surface. At the socket end there is traces of orange brown on the surface. The spearhead measures 101.3mm in length, 22.4mm in maximum width, 17.8mm in maximum thickness and weighs 57.51g.

934089,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe dating from about 2000-1700 BC. The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side view of the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. 



In cross section the body of the axe is H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been raised by hand hammering to form slight flanges. The flanges appear to have been cast and probably augmented by hammering. On both faces of the axe there is a slight bump / rib / proto-stop ridge, where the butt and the blade meet and the face of the axe changes angle. The thickness of the axe across the flanges is 12.6mm and the septum is 10.2mm thick at the proto-stop-ridge. There is no decoration present and the casting flanges have been trimmed filled and hammered flat.



The blade tip flares outwards from the body. One edge is angled outward, and the other is a concave curve. There is no obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge, although it does tapers giving a slightly blunt edge.



The surface of the axe has a well-developed dark green to dark grey patina. It is 92.8mm long, 43.1mm wide and 12.6mm thick. 108.1g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III), of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC.



The axe seems similar to some Brandon types. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. This example does not have a particular flared cutting blade.

The flanges are slightly damaged along the topmost edge on both sides, with pitting on the outward facing sides of each flange. Immediately below the stop ridge is a shield shaped depression. The blade has inward-bowing sides which flare towards the blade which terminates in a convex cutting edge, now heavily abraded. There is a vertical casting seam along each long edge, tool-marks indicating that this was filed down during finishing.

935731,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A near complete copper alloy Middle Bronze Age dirk (small rapier) dating to the period c.1500 - 1150 BC found in 4 adjoining pieces.



The butt exhibits a series of old breaks along the lower edge which is convex curved and widens out to a maximum of 16.7 mm in width. It then tapers inwards to form two C-shaped notches on either side which are the remains of two broken rivets holes used as the attachment point for the missing handle. Both rivets are missing, and the holes are too fragmented to accurately estimate their diameter.



From these rivet holes the sides of the rapier expand into the shoulders of the blade. The maximum width of these shoulders is 27.1mm. From the shoulders the edge of the rapier narrows into the blade. From this point the blade itself tapers in width more gradually to almost have straight edges towards the end of the blade, the tip of which is missing. The blade is pointed oval in cross-section with no clearly defined mid-rib or edge bevels.



The object has a dark green patina which is particularly thick on the blade close to the rapier's shoulders. On the hilt area are concreted deposits which may be the remains or organic material preserved by copper salts. The majority of the blade's edge on all fragments shows chips, notches and damage but these may be due to post depositional damage. The maximum surviving width of the blade from midrib to edge is 17.1mm and it is maximum thickness is 7mm.



The longest fragment of the blade is bent so that it now forms a gentle curve when viewed in profile. The bending of the blade this way, and the snapping of it, into multiple fragments may have been deliberate although the fragments were found together and still fit together.



The total length of the rapier measures 184.9mm while the surviving portion of the blade is 157.9mm long. Both these figures would have been longer if the longest section of the blade were not bent. The blade has a maximum width of 4.7mm and a minimum width of 2.1mm. It minimum thickness is 1.96mm and its maximum thickness is 6.8mm. The rapier weighs 29.35g.



The object is likely a Group IV blade, with a comparable example no.864 from Undley, Suffolk (Burgess and Gerloff 1981, Plate 107). Close parallels include SOM-EECC89, a complete GLO-036A39 and pieces of two further such implements SUR-A18104/Treasure case 2015 T331. All of these rapiers are of similar form, being of Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV (1981) and dating to the period c. 1500-c. 1150 BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2018-09-05T23:00:00Z,2018-12-06T00:00:00Z,,,29.35,,,6.8,184.9,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South West,Somerset,Sedgemoor,Middlezoy,ST3834,From finder,51.10193381,-2.88687454,SOM-71AABB,,SOM71AABBsection.jpg,Later Bronze Age rapier,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM71AABBsection.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1045077.jpg
935732,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1250,"An incomplete cast copper alloy leaf-shaped basal-looped spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500 - 1250 cal BC) probably Ehrenberg Class IIIa.



The spear has a sub-circular socket which tapers to a lozenge midrib with rounded ridges on the blade. The internal diameter of the socket is 17.9mm. The socket appears to be filled with concreted material, possibly organic 'fossils' imbuded with copper alloy salts..



The spear's blade is leaf-shaped (a stretched oval) and has narrow incorporated loops with flat plates, with no decoration, on either side at the base of the blade. A large proportion of the spear is covered in a green and brown copper corrosion and concreted material however enough of the blade is visible to discount the presence of channels along the spear. There also appear to be no defined edge bevels although the edges are sharp. The tip of the spear is broken off about 82.2mm from the base of the blade. The edges of the blade at the break are very chipped and fragmented. The break is unworn but patinated.



The concreted material on the surfaces appears to be organic material that was adjacent to the blade when deposited and has become concreted to it with the organics becoming imbuded with metal salts and preserved as 'fossils'.



Length 133.8mm, midpoint at 42.22mm from base of blade width 34.1mm, thickness 22.0. The midrib at the break at the tip end is 10.1mm thick and 6.6mm wide. The diameter of the socket mouth is between 20.3mm and 22.41. It weighs 91.58 grams.



The spear tip's poor preservation makes it difficult to precisely identify the length of the blade. If its tip was near the broken end of the spear the point of the blade's maximum width would lie between 40% and 50% of the blade as measured from its blade/socket junction. This would define the spear as a Davis type 2 (2006, 26). However, it is also possible that the blade extended further, or even became concave in form, which would change the classification of this blade to either the flame (type 3) or ogival (type 4) form respectively. The lozenge shaped midrib with its rounded corners would be consistent with these classes (Davis 2006, 33)



Regardless Davis's review of the dating evidence (ibid. p.49) concluded that, Type 2 and 3 'originated in the Acton park phase, and had its main period of use in the Taunton phase' (ibid. p.50), so around c.1500-1250 cal BC. However, there is also a limited amount of evidence to suggest that a few spearheads were in use beyond this period into the late Bronze Age, perhaps passed down from generation to generation as heirlooms (ibid.).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2018-09-05T23:00:00Z,2018-12-06T00:00:00Z,,,91.58,,,22,133.8,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South West,Somerset,Sedgemoor,Middlezoy,ST3834,From finder,51.10193381,-2.88687454,SOM-71B58D,,SOM71B58D.JPG,Bronze Age Basal looped spear head,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM71B58D.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1045033.jpg

936844,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete, Late Bronze Age penannular ring (or lock-ring) made from decorated gold sheet around a copper alloy core. The ring is oval in plan with a triangular cross-sectional profile. The face has a pronounced midrib and eight smaller concentric ribs running around either side of the face (17 ribs in total) suggesting construction from gold wire, in contrast to the gold sheeting of the inner surface and terminals which is flat and undecorated. The opening in the ring has been damaged, with the gold plate broken to reveal the corroded copper alloy core. One of the terminals has split and been pushed back inside the ring, with the sheeting ruptured; there is additional crushing damage to one side of the ring which has ruptured the sheeting on the inner surface.



Length: 19.6mm; width: 17.1mm; thickness: 5.2 mm; weight: 3.66g","These types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC). They belong to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings', 'ring-money' or 'lock-rings' but whose function remains uncertain. They may have been personal adornments worn on the ears or nose, rather than items of exchange. A closely similar example in size and construction in the British Museum's Greenwell Collection (WG 20) was found at Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland.

Conclusion: The item comprises more than 10% precious metal and is dated at over 300 years old at the time of finding. Additionally it is of prehistoric date and contains a proportion of precious metal. On both counts it therefore qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",3,Gold,Copper alloy,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2019-01-24T00:00:00Z,,2019T87,,3.66,6.8,,5.2,19.6,1,Simon Maslin,Simon Maslin,South East,West Sussex,Chichester,Oving,SU8904,From finder,50.82870559,-0.73767642,SUR-EFB639,,SUREFB639.jpg,,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUREFB639.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1045739.jpg
937125,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1000,800,"A gold lock-ring and three small fragments of gold. The lock-ring is decorated with a series of incised concentric lines. One edge of the lock-ring is broken in a ragged edge, the other follows a neat line that may represent the original edge or a cut mark. The lock-ring is in a moderate condition, with cuts and distortion across its faces. There is evidence of tubing holding the two faces together (this has lifted in one section to reveal this construction technique). Around 1 quarter of the object is now missing and it is unclear from the initial inspection whether the small gold fragments form part of the broken edge or whether they are remains of other elements within the lock-ring construction. More investigation of this piece is required.

Scientific Analysis

Analysis was carried out by the Department of Scientific Research at The British Museum. 

Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis indicated a surface composition of approximately 80-82% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being copper. 

Discussion

This Late Bronze Age gold &lsquo;lock-ring&rsquo; dates to the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC). Lock-rings are known in relatively small numbers from Ireland, Britain and western France (Eogan 1969). A small number of examples are known from the North of England and the South of Scotland (see Eogan 1994, figure 41). Most of the finest examples have been found in Ireland. The find from &lsquo;Near Errington&rsquo; is a fine example of its kind and, despite its moderate condition, deserves to be acquired and studied in further detail. 

Conclusion

Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",,3,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2019-01-27T00:00:00Z,,2019T94,,2.62,,29.62,2.86,,1,,Andrew Agate,North East,Northumberland,Northumberland,Wall,NY9672,,55.04249122,-2.06412989,NCL-066786,,DDS_0017_1.jpg,,Tyne and Wear Museums,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/andyagate/DDS_0017_1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1051669.jpg

937607,Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1150,43,"A complete cast copper alloy heavy duty ring probably dating from the late Bronze Age to Late Iron Age (c. 1150 BC - AD 43). The ring is circular in plan sub-circular in section. The inside of the ring has what appears to be file marks or possibly scratches resulting from use, however these markings do not cover the entire inner surface. A couple of sections are smooth like the outside, which may suggest the presence of a strap. One area of the ring is slightly thinner than the rest; again a possible indication of use. The ring is undecorated but it has a beautiful green-brown patina which, when compared to other typologically and chronologically distinctive artefacts from the same area, suggests a Bronze Age or Iron Age date. It has an internal diameter of 27.6mm.



Similar rings have been discovered in a number of Bronze Age hoards and have been suggested to be horse harness fittings, part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron (Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg types; Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g), or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire.

937649,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead dating from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age (c.800-700 BC). The collar and the upper half of the axe is missing and there three fragments of more of the wall of the axe that also survive. The lower half that survives is sub-rectangular in plan, triangular in profile and the socket is almost square in section. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The sides of the axehead are straight and almost parallel but expand slightly towards the blade making the cutting edge a little crescentic, which is probably the result of sharpening during use. The cutting edge is also slightly damaged although this appears to be limited to the surface corrosion and is more likely the result of soil movement and of agricultural equipment since depostion than of use. A longitudinal linear casting seam is visible on one side but the other side is pitted and more worn. Most of the surface is oxidized to a pale green with a few patches of dark green patina.



The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).

The palstave is in good condition but broken behind the stopridge, most of the rectangular cross-sectioned butt is missing. It has a single, well formed side loop. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which shows marks of hammering. On both sides there is a thin median rib from the stop ridge to the blade facet.



The object is an early/primary looped palstave (group III) with a mid-rib, dating to the Acton Park II to Taunton to early Penard phase of metalwork (1450 - 1200 BC). The blade facet shows ripples from the metal being drawn down through hammering to sharpen the blade. The surface of the rest of the blade, on all four sides, has many small indents that appear to be decorative.



The patina of the axe is almost complete. One face of the axe has a distinctive light blue to turquoise colour while the other is a darker green. The break appears old and has developed a green patina. The surface of the break is pitted and has several deep indents, formed by air bubbles in the alloy as the object was being cast.

The inner surface of the hole is rough and there is a visible casting flaw within the interior. The solidity of the bead and the rough cylindrical interior of the central hole suggests that the method of manufacture was casting rather than construction from sheet metal.



Diameter: 8.4mm, thickness / height: 6.3mm, weight: 1.88g.","This bead is likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC) based on comparanda from the database (NMS-AEC678 (2013T20), HAMP-72E451 (2011T526), PAS-65902F (2015T175) and GLO-46CA05 (2014T358)) and various other excavated examples from stratified contexts (as quoted in these PAS records). Such Middle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al.) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Roberts, 2007).



Conclusion: The object contains more than 10% precious metal and is of prehistoric date. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 and the 2002 Treasure Designation Order, in terms of both age and precious metal content.",3,Gold,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2019-01-27T00:00:00Z,,2019T138,,1.88,,8.4,6.3,,1,Simon Maslin,Simon Maslin,South East,Hampshire,Basingstoke and Deane,Overton,SU5049,From finder,51.23799766,-1.28516994,SUR-165AC6,,SUR165AC6.jpg,,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR165AC6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1049396.jpg
941113,Brooch,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Brooch of Central European, Bronze Age, type, c.1100-800 BC. It is made from a single length of 2.7mm diameter, copper alloy wire, one end of which is a tightly wound to form a six turn spiral. From this the wire is bent back on itself to form a hook-like catch plate. The wire is twisted back and forth to form five, figure of 8 loops on the end of which is an integral pin. The wire is cracked at this point. The brooch is in excellent condition with a mid-brown patination which contains some grains of sand. Length 99.3mm, Width 41.7mm, Height 26.2mm, Mass 30.31g.



This brooch is of Central European type and can be closely paralleled by two examples found in a hoard of gold jewellery on the bank of the Danube between Duna-Földvár and Paks in Hungary. This was dated to the 11th to 9th century BC (Hugh Tait, 7000 years of Jewellery, The British Museum, 2006, 51, plate 108). A further parallel is provided by an example in Merseyside Museums which is provenance as 'Northern Hungary' (Susan Nicholson, Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in the Merseyside County Museums, Merseyside County Council, Liverpool,, 1980, 70, No. 141.

The object consists of two pointed drop-shaped elements (one point is lost due to abrasion), D-shaped in cross-section and joined at their widest point, by a longitudinally recessed oval neck. There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both domed sides of the object, the tapering lower parts are plain. The two moustache tips or prongs flare slightly outwards and the retained point terminates in a narrow point. The central neck section of the object is plain and undecorated but the underside (between the two prongs) has a sub-circular perforation, believed to facilitate the attachment of the object.





The metal has a dark green smooth patina with some areas of light green corrosion.





Height: 19.95mm, Width: 43.91mm, Thickness: 12.66mm, Weight: 21.2g","These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117).

This spear blade most closely fits his Class 6b (Davis 2012: 82) including Nos.309, 311 and 313..

Description



1. [ENF 127270 (1167).1] Complete copper alloy quoit-headed pin. The shank is roughly circular sectioned and has a marked bend near the tip.  The shank with the lower part of the head is broken away from the rest of the head with what appears to be a recent break. The edges of the oval head are raised into slight flanges.  The surface is covered with corrosion products but is probably undecorated. 



Weight: 86g, Max length: 317mm; Max width of oval head loop: 165mm, Max width of oval head/loop: 124mm; Max width of head/loop: 6mm



2. [ENF 127270 (1167).5] Complete copper alloy quoit-headed pin. The shank is roughly circular sectioned and has a marked bend near the tip.  The break on this pin appears to be older, but is probably relatively recent. The edges of the oval head are raised into distinct flanges. The surface is covered with corrosion products but is probably undecorated.



Weight: 117g, Max length: 376mm; Max width of oval head loop: 167mm; Max height of oval head: 153mm; Max width of head/loop: 10mm



3. [ENF 127270 (1176).2] Complete copper alloy spiral twisted torc (or 'neckring') with plain hooked terminals.  The surface is covered with corrosion products so it is not clear whether the torc is bar twisted or cast.  The breaks are recent.



Weight: 91g, Max diameter: (somewhat oval) c.175mm by 160mm; Max width: 7mm



4. [ENF 127270 (1176).3] Complete copper alloy spiral twisted torc (or 'neckring') with plain hooked terminals. The surface is covered with corrosion products so it is not clear whether the torc is bar twisted or cast.  The breaks appear ancient.



Weight: 94g, Max diameter: (approximately circular), c.182mm by 186mm; Max width: 7mm



5. [ENF 127270 (1176).4] Incomplete copper alloy spiral twisted armring/bracelet. The surface is covered with corrosion products so it is not clear whether the bracelet is bar twisted or cast.  Both terminals are missing and the breaks are ancient.



Weight: 42g, Max diameter: (approximately circular but slightly misshapen) c.77mm 



6. [ENF 127270 (1167).6] Incomplete copper alloy plain penannular bracelet. The surface is relatively un-corroded.  Sub-circular in profile with slightly flattened internal face. Both terminals missing although are squared on the surviving parts.  The breaks are ancient.



Weight: 46g, Max diameter: (approximately circular) c.75mm 



Note on condition: The objects have been superficially cleaned but are in need of x-ray (which may reveal further detail) and conservation.



Discussion



The 'Hopton-on-Sea' hoard can be dated typologically to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC). Their dating can be further narrowed down to type and metalwork phase. The quoit-headed pins, twisted torcs and bracelet are characteristic of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' which has been dated to the Taunton and Penard metalwork phases (c.1400-1150 BC) (Roberts 2007, 139-41). 





There are several close parallels for 'ornament hoards' of this phase with a mixture of torcs, quoit-headed pins and bracelets/arm rings, for example the Barton Bendish hoard, Norfolk (Hawkes 1955, GB 7:2 (1-2); Rowlands 1976, 249, no. 93); the Monkswood hoard, Somerset (Smith 1959a, GB 42:2; Rowlands 1976, 257, no. 115) and the Taunton Union Workhouse hoard, Somerset (Smith 1959a, GB 43:2; Rowlands 1976, 258-9, no. 120).



Twisted neck-rings and bracelets have mostly been found in Southern England, especially in Wessex and East Anglia (Rowlands 1976, map 22; Roberts 2007, appendix). Four bronze spiral-twisted torcs from three sites are known from Norfolk (Ibid.), while only three spiral-twisted bracelet/armrings are known (Ibid.), all from the Barton Bendish hoard (Hawkes 1955, GB 7:2 (2)). Plain penannular bracelets are a relatively common feature of Middle Bronze Age hoards in Southern England and their Continental European parallels have been discussed by O'Connor (1980, 86-7, 467-8).



Quoit-headed pins are relatively rare: less than 60 are known (Pendleton, personal dataset; cf. Rowlands 1976, 86-7, map 21). Prior to the Hopton-on-Sea find, only nine quoit-headed pins were known from eight sites in Norfolk (Roberts 2007, Appendix; Robbins 2008; Crawford 2009). The Hopton-on-Sea examples are some of the largest, being the 5th and 7th longest recorded (C. Pendleton, personal dataset; cf. Rowlands 1976, 86). The largest are those from the Boughton Fen hoard, Norfolk at 435 mm; from the Pentney Hoard, Norfolk at 400mm; one of the Taunton Union Workhouse pins is c.400mm; the Newhaven area hoard, Sussex example is c.555mm and an unprovenanced pin in the British Museum is c.348mm long.  The recently excavated fragment from Lambourne, West Berkshire may also approach this size.  The Hopton pins also have the 3rd and 4th largest heads, only the Boughton Fen and Newhaven area pin heads are larger (C. Pendleton, personal dataset).



The two Hopton-on-Sea pins both have their tips bent.  This is a common feature on the larger pins suggesting it was deliberate and probably functional.  The flat section heads with flanges are also commonly found on both larger and smaller pins.  There are a range of other significant traits on quoit-headed pins.  Their form and size varies considerably yet there does not appear to be any identifiable regional traits, with examples of all types being found in the different regions of southern England (they occur mainly in East Anglia, the south coast and south-west).





It is notable that some of the objects in the hoard display ancient breaks, others are utilised or incomplete (though still usable) indicating this group is likely to be of a functional and personal nature, a common feature on most Middle Bronze Age hoards in the region. The torcs and quoit-headed pins appeared to have been deposited in the ditch fill as pairs of objects and there may therefore be some intentional grouping in the way the hoard was deposited.



Ornament hoards are a feature of the period in Continental Europe, particularly in NW France. Indeed, twisted torcs have close parallels in Continental Europe, especially the Nordic area (Smith 1959b, 149; O'Connor 1980, 79-80). However, quoit-headed pins are unique to southern England, the most northerly known so far coming from Ranby, Lincolnshire (Rowlands 1976, 86, map 21; cf. Roberts 2007, 143, fig. 4). The find therefore represents a collection of ornaments with both local (Southern English) and European parallels.

942948,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy ribbed socketed axe head dating to the later Bronze Age (c. 950-750 BC). The surviving axe consists of part of the broken body and blade, with missing loop and collar. The body of the axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge. The cast longitudinal moulding consisting of four parallel ribs extends partially along both the front and rear faces, terminating at what would approximately have been the mid-point of each face. The moulding is incomplete where the axe is broken, and very worn on one side. The sides of the axe are lentoidal in plan and the trimmed central longitudinal casting seams are clearly visible. The body of the axe narrows towards the expanded blade. The blade edge is rounded and damaged in several areas through abrasion and corrosion and is missing one tip. The inside of the axe is hollow and sub-rectangular in cross-section and contains small traces of depositional residual on the interior surfaces. As well as being unevenly broken at one end, the axe also has several areas of lamination and scratches on its outside surfaces, all of which are patinated, like all of the exterior surfaces, in a mid-green colour. The interior surfaces of the axe have a similar coloured patina with additional patches of brown.



The axe measures 73.5mm in length, 39.6mm in width and 3.8mm thick at the blade, 29.2mm in width and 28.8mm thick at the broken socketed end, 3.9mm in maximum wall thickness, and weighs 147.30 grams.

The blade has a trapezoidal hilt with the surviving shoulder rounded and containing a single rivet hole. The other shoulder is missing, with an old patinated break across its rivet hole. The top edge is slightly concave between the shoulders, but this is probably owing to damage. The blade narrows from the shoulders to the break, the edges being slightly concave. The blade is elliptical in cross-section, with a slightly thicker centre, but no central rib or any decoration on the blade. The tip of the blade is missing, with an old break running across it at a slight diagonal. It is not possible to estimate the original length of the rapier or dirk. The blade has a mottled green and brown patina on both sides. It is 93.2mm long, 41.4mm wide and 2.4mm thick. It weighs 35.68g.



Taplow Type dirks (less than 30cm long) and rapiers often have four rivet holes (unlike this example), and rounded shoulders as this one does. Some have very flat blades, like this one, and many of the blades are plain (Burgess and Gerloff, Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain cited by Dr Dot Boughton, pers comm 28th March 2019).

In plan the artefact is slightly oval measuring 23.0mm by 20.3mm in diameter. Placed at the centre of the object on each side mirroring each other are two circular concave depressions measuring 8.2mm in diameter that are each approximately 1.5mm deep. However, the object is 4.8mm thick such that these depressions do not pierce through from one side to the other.



The artefact has a terminal knop projecting 6.2mm from the wider side of this item. This knop is pierced by a hole c.4mm in diameter. In cross section the knop is rectangular, however, the majority of the object, barring the concave depressions, is a pointed oval in cross section.



The object appears to be solid and has a light green patina and shows a little abrasion.



From the knop to its far end the artefact measure 26.8mm long, it is 4.8mm thick and it weighs10.28g.



If the concave depressions were pierced through the the object would be very similar in form to items found from a hoard at Parc-Y-Meirch, known as the Dinorben hoard (Savory 1980, 187). These are seen as the inner pieces of composite strap fittings. The Dinorben hoard is dated to c.9th century BC (ibid, 59) a time within the Late Bronze Age (c. 1150 - 800 cal BC). Similar items on the database such as LIN-34D2A3, NMGW-A0EC15 have also been dated to this period although there are now suggestions that these should be placed in the Iron Age (see CAM-6A8D1B, WAW-03C3E2)",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2018-10-01T23:00:00Z,2019-01-02T00:00:00Z,,,10.28,,8.2,4.8,,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Shrewton,SU0744,From finder,51.19517776,-1.90120483,SOM-797D49,,SOM797D49.jpg,Bronze Age harness fitting,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM797D49.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1049110.jpg

There are two sub-circular/rectangular loops incorporated into the base of the blade, one either side of the central rib. The mid-rib extends and expands to form the hollow circular-sectioned socket. Both edges of the blade are abraded. The base of the socket is compressed and damaged, and there is deposition residue inside the hollow cavity.

The socket end is square in shape, measuring 30.4mm by 30.5mm. All four internal surfaces are intact and in good condition. On the upper and lower surface there is a raised casting flash, following a seam along the length of the object. On all four sides a raised pattern of three lines wraps around the object, taking up the space between the end and the small, shallow handle. The internal space is a condensed circle measuring 7.1mm in diameter, while the handle surface itself is tapered, from a narrow triangle at the proximal end to a wide flare at the distal end. The object itself narrows from 30.5mm to 21.8mm in width, before flaring sharply to a small, neat blade that measures 27.8mm across and is 3.1mm thick at the cutting edge. The blade is a convex curve.



The surface is covered with a mid-green patina with large areas of a darker corrosion. There is one patch where this darker corrosion has caused deeper damage to the metal, approximately 3/4 of the way down the shaft, where there is also a sharper linear nick in the surface.



Similar examples include SOM-AE4024, the record for which records that Taunton-Hademarschen axes were previously thought to date to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800BC) but the finding of an example on the Isle of Wight in a hoard of Taunton phase palstaves (Treasure Annual Reoprt 2003, p. 197), confirming the Middle Bronze Age date and distribution suggesting a date of 1400 to 1150 BC. These characteristically long thin axes are relatively rare but other examples are known from Somerset including from Norton Fitzwarren (see Needham et al, Archaeological Journal 154, 1997, 87, fig 18,5 and the corroded example from Norton Fitzwarren Needham, Somerset Archaeology & Natural History 133, 1989, 37-8, fig 17,11).

Description: 



A decorated sheet of gold of probable Bronze Age date, c.1000 - 800 BC.



The object is formed of a thin sub-rectangular sheet of gold, folded over at one end. It is not possible to determine if the object is complete or cut down though the latter is likely. The front surface of the sheet is decorated by a series of sub-parallel indented grooves running along its length.



Dimensions:



Length: 10.4mm; Width: 9.6mm; Thickness: 0.3mm; Weight: 0.4g.



Discussion:



Similar objects have been recorded as 2019 T316 (LEIC-47D0C2), 2018 T650 (HAMP-F792A5), 2010 T664 (LVPL-83FE92) and 2013 T471 (WMID-3CBCF0). The latter record states that similar multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48).



2017 T882 (SOM-62CE08) states that several similar pieces have also been found bent into cylindrical beads and it is unclear if this was their original purpose or if this was a common reuse for parts of larger ribbon ornaments.



Conclusion: 



In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",,4,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,2019T274,,0.4,,,0.3,10.4,1,Rebecca Griffiths,Rebecca Griffiths,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Selby,Brayton,SE5930,GPS (from the finder),53.76302021,-1.10648841,YORYM-AC3574,,2019T274.jpg,Bronze Age : Bead,York Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/2019T274.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1054213.jpg
944832,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,1150,410,"An unfinished cast copper alloy miniature socketed axehead, dating to c.1150 BC-410 AD. The axe has the remains of the irregular globule of casting sprue at the cutting edge. Broadly sub-triangular with tapering parallel sides. The socket opening is oval. One face of the axe demonstrates a casting flaw which slightly distorts the profile of the object, though there are no casting seams visible anywhere on the object. A prominent sub-circular groove is visible on one edge of the axe, this is probably a failed attempt at creating a loop which may have served to suspend the piece, this is probably the reason why the object was not completed.

The metal is a mid-green in colour with a pitted and corroded patina.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).

946529,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"A cast copper alloy unlooped palstave axehead of Middle Bronze Age date (circa 1500 to circa 1300 BC). The axehead is broken at the butt end with a ragged, but ancient, break. It has two longitudinal flanges which extend from the butt end beyond the curving stop ridge. Viewed from the side, these ridges are lozenge shaped. The attributes on the palstave are very worn. It is likely that there was a shield-shaped moulding below the stop ridge and a rib down the centre of the blade on both faces. The blade is narrow and without the usual prominent splayed tips of other early palstaves. The axehead is heavily worn and corroded, with a pitted grey-green patina. There are areas of a glossy olive green patina on either side of the stop ridge, on both faces of the axe. This palstave axehead belongs to the Taunton Phase of Bronze Age metalwork, dating circa 1400-1250 BC. It is similar to no. 809 in Schmidt and Burgess 1981, described as a low flanged palstave Type Wantage Variant Blackrock.



The object measures 119.2mm in length and is 38.3mm at the widest point of the blade. It is 21.1mm wide at the butt end. It is 18.7mm thick across the stop ridge and only 5.7mm thick at the thinnest part of the blade.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-03-20T00:00:00Z,2019-03-20T00:00:00Z,,,,,,18.7,119.2,1,Natasha Harlow,Natasha Harlow,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Stratford-on-Avon,Tanworth-in-Arden,SP1073,Generated from computer mapping software,52.35497432,-1.85459865,DENO-B68BB2,,DENOB68BB2.jpg,Bronze Age palstave axe,Derby Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENOB68BB2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1056716.jpg
947201,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-1000,"Description: Rectangular piece of gold sheet with repoussé and punched decoration, of early to middle Bronze Age date. The decoration consists of three longitudinal panels, each one made from a pair of relief lines or creases with  corresponding grooves on the reverse, so either pushed out from the reverse (the repoussé technique) or hammered over a  shaped former or patrix.  Each of the panels is filled with two longitudinal rows of punched dots, some set in pairs and others offset to give a zig-zag effect. The punch used was circular and round-ended.



Each short edge is broken, but each straight long edge has about 2mm in width neatly folded over to the reverse; the fold runs along the outermost of the relief lines. The entire object is now crumpled.



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 40mm. The width varies due to the crumpled condition, from a minimum of 13mm in the centre to a maximum of 17mm at one end. The sheet is perhaps 0.25mm thick and the folded areas are a maximum of 1.5mm thick. It weighs 3.0g.



Discussion and Date: Rectangular gold strips with dot or pointillé decoration have been recorded on the PAS database at BUC-4313C7, PAS-35C8A8 and WAW-FF1E9A, and longitudinal creases have been recorded at WILT-34D958. This example has relatively complex decoration, but otherwise fits well into a group of ribbon or strip ornaments of early to middle Bronze Age date, c. 2350 to 1000 BC.","As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.

The rear half has flanged sides on both the top and bottom faces that project vertically creating a U-shaped channel that terminate at the stop ridge that is position in the middle of the item. A small triangular indentation sits in front to the stop ridge.  



The sides on the front half have a shallow concave arc that expands out to either tip of the blade. The forward edge of the blade has a short bevel (2mm long) on both sides, although one side is steeper than the other and maybe an indication that this item was sharpened in antiquity. 





This item is in excellent condition with much of the original patina remaining in the form of a smooth brown layer, this has been chipped of in places leaving a dark green surface behind.

947323,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"A complete although broken Late Bronze Age copper alloy sword of the Ewart Park Metalworking Industry (c. 950 - 750 BC). The hilt of the sword is formed from a straight bar (45mm long), the forward side of which tapers into the narrow grip. The grip is 75mm long and has slightly convex sides, bring at the thickest two thirds along its length. There is a line of three rivet holes in the centre of the grip. The grip leads onto the hilt of the sword that expands outwards with straight angled edges and two rivet holes on each side. Form the hilt the sides curve down to the leaf shaped blade which is 29mm wide near its base and gently expands to 39mm wide at the final quarter before rapidly narrowing to the pointed tip. In cross-section the blade has a low oval shape with pointed tips that have bevelled edges.





This item has been broken into seven separate parts, at each of the breaks the sword has been bent by between 30-40 degrees in order to achieve the break. This is not post-depositional damage but a premeditated act prior to loss/burial. Similar post-depositional ritualistic acts can also be seen on Bronze Age items LVPL-55FB97, HAMP-24C69E and GLO-7EFE1A.",,4,Copper alloy,,Informed finder that the object should be submitted as Treasure,Metal detector,2018-01-17T00:00:00Z,,,,572,,,6,587,1,Kurt Adams,Kurt Adams,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Madley,SO4039,From finder,52.04613044,-2.87628591,GLO-37B31F,,GLO37B31F.jpg,,Bristol City Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO37B31F.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1058922.jpg

947589,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-100,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy rounded moustache-shaped object of late Bronze Age or Iron Age date.



Description: The object has been cast in one and survives as half of its original crescentric shape. The remaining half tapers to a damaged point from a bulbous body down to a point with cast alternating ridges and grooves running up to the point. The alternating pattern is not present on the inside edge of the object and consists of 22 lines in total. The object appears to have snapped just pst the grooved body as seen on KENT-77A0BF. The point has also been blunted and splayed. The breaks seems to be heavily worn 



Measurements: 41.7mm wide, 35.27mm high. 14.56mm thick. 20.36g



Discussion: A good number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database. Examples with a shape very similar to this example include PAS reference numbers KENT-77A0BF, NARC-925E14,  HAMP-6F4C45 and BERK-719DA8. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117).



They are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although the lozenge shaped recess at the bottom of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. This was possibly something such as a dagger handle, although the absence of evidence makes this conjectural. Another suggestion has been a Scabbard Chape, in which case the object would be the other way up. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,20.36,35.27,,14.56,41.7,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Maidstone,Lenham,TQ9051,Centred on field,51.22656114,0.7197557,KENT-4C615E,,KENT4C615E.jpg,fragment of Moustache shaped object,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT4C615E.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1052257.jpg

The sides of the axe are triangular, and the body of the axe narrows towards the expanded blade. The blade edge is rounded and damaged in several areas through abrasion and corrosion. The inside of the axe is hollow and sub-rectangular in cross-section. The blade has been roughly evenly broken off at one end, the axe also has several areas of lamination and scratches on its outside surfaces, all of which are patinated, like all of the exterior surfaces, in a mid-green colour. The interior surfaces of the axe have a similar coloured patina.

One point is slightly longer than the others and each of the four faces is slightly indented. There are some scratches on the rounded end.

Description: From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117).

The palstave has worn high side flanges with long extensions, their highest point being above the stop ridge, with the base circles of the side-loop on either side of the stop ridge, and a broad blade that is triangular in plan. The squared-off protruding stop ridge produces a rectangular aperture in plan and the worn down side flanges are lozenge-shaped in profile.The stop is 11 mm wide and 9 mm deep on both sides and the thickness of the worn side flanges together, front and back, is 23 mm. Below the stop ridge the narrow blade is parallel to the exterior in plan, at 20 mm wide, and inset from the stop ridge in profile and 10 mm thick, and starts to expand into the triangular blade after 10 mm towards the cutting edge which is 55 mm wide and 2 mm thick. The blade has a central mid rib which is 4 mm wide and 68 mm long, and two raised edges, 4 mm thick, following the slightly curved edge of the blade to a length of 80 mm. The two bases of the side loop project outwards 1 mm from the surface of one side of the palstave and are 5 mm in diameter and 8 mm apart. The casting seam below the loop as been chiselled away, but there is still a raised seam above it, and another seam on the opposite side of the hafting end of the palstave. The entire surface of the palstave is corroded and pitted and the cutting edge of the blade is damaged and subsequently corroded so it is difficult to determine how much the edge was used and resharpened.

951376,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"Fragment of a copper-alloy Bronze Age socketed spearhead. The handle socket is entirely missing from an old brittle-break at the point where it would have originally joined the blade. The pronounced midrib continues for the full length of the blade with an internally round socket extending just over halfway towards the tip. Externally the midrib contours smoothly to form the wings of the spearhead blade, the profile of which has a sub-lozengiform shape, reaching a maximum width at the approximate halfway point. The profile of the blade wings from the socket to the widest point has a slight curve suggesting more of a leaf-shape profile, but the forward profile to the tip is much more of a linear taper with one flange stepping-in slightly suggesting material loss at this point, either through post deposition damage or perhaps more likely in-use modification such as sharpening. There is no extant evidence of edge bevelling around any of the blade periphery. Unfortunately due to the missing socket it is not possible to determine the means of attachment to the shaft, either with Middle Bronze Age loops, or pegs associated with the later Bronze Age.

1. Small butt-end fragment of a flanged palstave. Oblique brittle fracture, pitted dark brown patination with green around eroded edges. Extant length 35mm, width 18mm, weight 35g.



2. Triangular tip fragment of a spearhead. Sharp midrib giving a star-like cross section. Transverse brittle fracture. Dark brown patination. Length 41mm, width 17.7mm, thickness 7.6mm, weight 9g.



3. Crescent-shaped cutting edge fragment probably from a palstave. Blade width almost complete, with one side truncated just short of the full width. Curved brittle and broadly transverse fracture across the crescentic edge (maximum width in centre of fragment 15mm) Dark brown pitted patination very similar to 1, and could be opposite ends of the same object. Length 59mm, thickness 6.5mm, weight 18g.



4. Blade fragment of a socketed chisel, flaring from 15mm to 27mm over its 41mm extant length. Broken towards the butt end with the thin-walled socket (0.9mm) pushed in from one side causing a crease down towards the blade end. The socket neck at the point of fracture was originally oval, extending to a maximum depth of 33mm into the 41mm extant length of the chisel. Weight 14.72g. 



5. Amorphous sub-ovoid globule with matching patination and colouration to other objects. Maximum length 18mm, maximum thickness 9.2mm, weight 10g.



6. Unidentified fragment with exposed uncorroded scraped bare metal on both faces, probably as a result of recent cultivation damage. The object has some form, with what appear to be original edges, but the parent object cannot be determined. Length 58mm, maximum width 18mm, weight 38g.



Discussion and Date: Objects 1 to 3 are possibly Middle Bronze Age in date, but as fragments the diagnostic features that position them more precisely in the period are missing.

Description: The axehead has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle, with two concave faces flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentic cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It is proceed by a double raised collar. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have been worked down either through hammering or filing/polishing, but remain fairly prominant particularly towards the collar end. The blade edge has some wear but remains in good conditions. The side loop remains on one side. The axehead has a dark greenish well formed patina with some slightly lighter mottling in places, but is fairly restricted although may be areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.

Discussion: This group of palstaves represents an important addition to the Middle Bronze Age hoards from coastal areas in Britain and the near Continent (see Needham et al. 2013, Ch. 4). Three or four of the palstaves are of Breton type and two or three are of Norman type, with only one recognisable as a British type. The closest parallel for this find is the Marnhull hoard, Dorset, where 90 palstaves were recovered (25 of Breton type and the majority of the remainder of Norman type) (Lawson & Farwell 1991; cf. O'Connor 2009, 274-5). O'Connor suggests that these palstaves originated in Lower Normandy (Ibid., 274). Breton and Norman type palstaves were also found together at Hayling Beach, Hampshire in gravel (and therefore possibly redeposited from elsewhere; see Ibid. for details and references) and from Easton, Hampshire (Ibid.). It is likely that the Continental palstave types from the 'Portsmouth area' hoard were also imports and therefore form an important additional find.



The uncertain origins of this hoard make it difficult to establish how the objects were deposited. However, the unusually degraded condition and quality of the patina of the palstaves described above (Nos. 1-12), combined with their unusual typology (primarily imports of Breton and Normandy types from France) make it highly probable that they were deposited together as a single deposit.



Conclusion: As a find of two or more objects of copper alloy, this find qualifies a Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

953256,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"Two complete gold-plated cast penannular rings dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age (c.1150-750 BC), and a probable Bronze Age (c. 1000 BC-750 BC) awl. 



The penannular rings are in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop that tapers slightly towards the terminals. One of the rings is plain. The other is heavily corroded on the surfaces but appears to have ribbed decoration.



The uncorroded ring is 16.9mm in diameter, with a thickness of 5.7mm and a weight of 8.14 grans. The corroded ring is 19mm in diameter, 7mm thick and weighs 11.41 grams.



The probable Bronze Age awl is circular in section and tapers to a blunt point at one end and a rounder point at the other. The surface has a dark green patina with some small areas of fine pitting. 



The awl measures 85.2mm in length, a maximum of 4.2mm in diameter and weighs 6.88 grams.



Awls are difficult to date but most are probably the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117), they were presumably used for perforating leather.



As a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002). They note that although most awls are associated with leather working, some would have been used in woodworking, bone working and other crafts.","Conclusion:  As the penannular rings are Bronze Age in date and made of gold, they qualify as treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996. Being found close to them and of similar date, it is possible that the awl is associated with them and qualifies as treasure as part of this case.

The original mushroom rivets are lost. The dirk is 43.5mm wide across the butt and narrows to 14.5mm at the blade tip, which has been lost. The blade has bevelled edges and a flattened lozengiform / lentoid cross section with a distinctive central rib which extends all the way from butt to the tip. This thickened rib adds strength to the blade and is a diagnostic feature of this type of short sword or dirk which is thought to be used for thrusting and piercing rather than cutting and slashing. The blade is slightly bent midway along although it is unclear as to whether this demonstrates an intentional pre-depositional act. The edges of the blade and the surface demonstrate post depositional damage and loss from corrosion.","This dirk is perhaps best attributed to a Taplow or Keelogue Type of the Acton Park industry.

A small piece of wood was found inside the socket; it is very small and fits into the base of the shaft. It is roughly triangular in shape with a rounded tip and mainly green in colour. A tiny copper alloy pin was also discovered in the perforation hole.

954279,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"An incomplete copper alloy side-looped spear of Middle Bronze Age dating (c. 1550 BC to c. 1250 BC). It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).



The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces, triangular in cross-section, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. There is some damage to the edges of the blade and no edge bevels are discernable. The socket is oval in cross-section and is hollow. The socket is 50.8 mm deep. It has cast side loops roughly half way along the socket. The loops are a flat oval in cross-section, and one is blocked with a casting flange that has not been trimmed. The casting seams along the sides of the socket have been trimmed.



It measures 120.2 mm in length. a maximum blade width of 23.5 mm, a minimum blade width of 8.0 mm. The edges of the blades are 1.7 mm thick. At the base of the wings, the socket has an external diameter of 12.8 mm and at the base of the socket, it measures 18.2 mm. The socket is 2.3 mm thick. The side loops measure 14.4 mm long and 5.4 mm wide. They are 3.3 mm above the surface of the socket. It weighs 63.13 g.



The spear has a smooth dark brown patina.

The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow and thin butt end which extends to a curved cutting edge with splayed blade. Raised flanges are present along the edges of both sides of the axehead each showing signs of heavy wear. No casting flashes are visible. No sign of a proto stop.



It measures 103.0 mm long, 28.2 mm wide at the blade, 16.5 mm wide at the butt end. 7.2 mm thick in the centre, 11.0 mm thick including the flanges. It weighs 91.78 g. The flanges are 52.7 mm long, extending from the butt end to midway along the body. They extend a maximum of 2.4 mm above the body.



The axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. The surface is heavily pitted, either as a result of poor casting or due to soil conditions whilst buried.



Similar flanged axeheads have been recorded on the PAS database, including: YORYM-D5C7D6. The lack of a proto stop ridge is suggestive that this flanged axehead may fall within the Acton Park I phase, possibly dating to between c. 1600 BC to c. 1400 BC.

The ring has a solid round cross section, with a thicker section (8.25mm) bearing three slightly swollen areas facing outward, possibly as decoration. The object is otherwise undecorated.



The metal has a dark brown patina. The surface is moderately pitted. particularly in the thicker area, possibly damaged in use.



23.85mm diameter (external), 10.23 mm internal diameter. Thickness 8.25 mm at thickest part to 6mm at narrowest. 20.2g



Similar rings have been discovered as part of late Bronze Age hoards (see for example: (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, plate 152; YORYM-15AA2D/2014-T442, the latter noting the possibility ""that the ring was a fitting on the haft of a socketed axe"" perhaps explaining why these rings are often found as part of socketed axe assemblages). The PAS database record for for WILT-1A5240 includes the suggestion that rings of this form may have been part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended, or part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron (citing: Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g). This record also notes that the ring may be a form of harness ring (see Note below). Other examples recorded on the PAS database include: LIN-4EE61E; HAMP-6F9658; NARC-5B60BD; WILT-30BB4B; LANCUM-D8A073 etc.



(Note: The possibility that this ring may have been an early Lewis (2015, 77:) form of Type (i) Plain round Terret ring (excavated examples from secure contexts dating from the 5th century BC to the mid-2nd century BC) was considered. However, Lewis states that this Type is usually made of iron, or iron with a copper-alloy sheath (ibid, 87) thus, and given the relatively small size, an earlier form of Bronze age ring was the preferred interpretation.)

The palstave is slender in form, tapering from the broad and low stop to the flared cutting edge. The butt is relatively long and slim, and would once have had ridges on either side, although these have been damaged post depositionally and are now reduced to slight raised areas on either side of the butt. Similarly, on one side the base of a loop is just visible, but the loop is now destroyed. On both faces, at the point where where the butt meets the stop there is a small horizontal groove, but it is not clear whether this is part of the design or the result of damage. The object is covered in a dark green patina, although some areas of the original brownish colour survive with pocks and scores in the surface indicative of damage.



It is similar to IOW-8A6D18, but NMS-1719F0 is a better parallel which is in far superior condition and has the loop surviving.

Description: From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117).

The blade edge is abraded, slightly blunt where complete and has notches. Both faces of the blade are decorated with a single rib. The sides of the blade are triangular with a casting seam which has been smoothed, but still forms a slight ridge. There is no loop on the palstave.



The sides of the septum have a more prominent cast seam ridge, and the sides taper towards the butt of the palstave. There is a deep stop on both faces of the septum with a flange running down the sides on each face. The flanges on the side view taper in depth towards the butt. One face at the butt has a deeper possible air hole. The butt is abraded.



The palstave has an incomplete well-developed mottled dark grey patina which is pitted. Where there is a more recent scrape the metal is a shiny grey colour.

There is not much difference in width between septum and blade; the particular narrowness of the blade suggests an ancillary use as a chisel. The low flanges are slightly abraded with a small dent in one side. Just beyond the stop ridge on either side is plano-convex indentation. The blade end of the palstave widens from the stop ridge towards the cutting edge while reducing in thickness. The cutting edge is crescentic with slightly expanded and curved tips; the blade edge itself is bevelled on each side and narrow to a thin, sharp cutting edge. The casting seams along the edge of the palstave have been filed; pitting along the seam appears to have been filled with a molten bronze. Hammer-marks are visible along both sides.

The palstave dates to the late Middle Bronze Age or early Late Bronze Age, most likely within the late Taunton or possibly Penard metalwork assemblages, that is c. 1250-1000 BC, corresponding with Needham Period 5-6, Burgess metalworking phase IX - X. It can be compared with narrow bladed palstaves from the Sidlesham hoard, now in Chichester Museum (Rowlands 1976, Vol. 2, p. 269/pl. 8; ref. 148, especially 148.3); Rowlands classifies them as Class 1 narrow bladed palstaves.

The butt end is narrow (perhaps through wear), measuring 13.6mm wide and 6.1mm thick, expanding to the stop ridge (25.4mm wide and 23.5mm thick) which appears to overhang slightly on each face. The line of the butt end meets in a gentle curve at this point.

Below the blade flares from the stop ridge to the cutting edge, 32.1mm wide, perhaps curving outwards slightly just above.

The object has a thick light green crust largely lost in places to reveal a dark grey colour beneath.

He kept it in a sealed, wet environment which lead a month later to severe deterioration of the surface crust. Claire Woodhead, Conservator, Hampshire Cultural Trust, comments '[The] surface crust is unusual; brittle and porous. It is unclear how much metal remains in core. There is a possibility that copper sulphides have reacted with the water to form sulphates (i.e. sulphuric acid) which may have contributed to decay' (June 2019).

959547,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500 BC to c. 1150 BC) cast copper alloy side looped socketed spearhead. The spearhead socket is broadly an elongated sub-triangular in plan and profile with a leaf-shaped blade. The socket is almost complete and is circular at the base and tapers towards the blade. At the lower edge of the socket, on the exterior the surface is slightly off-set, therefore the external diameter of the socket becomes slightly smaller.



On the exterior edge of the socket, on either side, there is an integral loop which has oval perforations. A trace of a casting seam is visible on one side of the socket only.



The blade of the spear is leaf-shaped which has a pronounced midrib on both faces. One midrib has a slight recent scrape revealing fresh metal. The edges of the blade are slightly abraded thereby losing some of their cutting edge. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead.



The surface of the spearhead has an incomplete mid brown patina, which is lighter on the blade than the socket.



The spearhead measures 148.87mm in length, has a maximum width (across the blade) 25.78mm and maximum thickness of 17.76mm (across the socket). The depth of the socket is not know as still partially filled with soil. With the soil insert, the spearhead weighs 56.49g. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.



Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards which was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC.



The loops on socketed spearheads would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.",See also Davis Group 6 (2017: 2).,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2019-05-30T23:00:00Z,,,56.49,,,17.76,148.87,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Little Ness,SJ4019,Centred on parish,52.76525057,-2.89065704,WAW-C9E8FD,,WAWC9E8FD.jpg,"Bronze Age spearhead (plan, profile, plan and profile).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWC9E8FD.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1062388.jpg

959868,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-800,"A fragment an unidentified object of possible Bronze Age date, 2350 BC - 800 BC. It is a flat sub-rectangular piece of copper alloy, with tapering sides at the long edges and probable breaks for the short edges.It tapers in thickness, and there is a slight hint of a thickened mid-rib on one face. The long edges are chamfered, but have no surface patina surviving, making it impossible to know if they were original edges. The plate is too thick and the edges too abrupt to be part of a blade. The short edges are more uneven, and again, have no surface patina surviving, apart from one small speck in the middle of the shortest edge. They appear to be broken edges, and the patina which has mostly flaked off, could have developed since the breakage.



On both faces, there are patches of a more reflective grey material, perhaps a white metal rich alloy. The rest of the metal is dark grey where the patina survives, and light green and textured like fine sandpaper where is does not survive. It is 43.5mm long, 34.9mm wide and 6.6mm thick. It weighs 29.55g.



The possible Bronze Age date is given because it comes from the same field as SWYOR-107F44, a Taplow rapier. However, a prehistoric date is by no means certain.

960130,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"Middle to Late Bronze Age copper-alloy early palstave (1500-1300 BC): The blade of the palstave is sub-trapezoidal in plan with slightly concave sides, and very flared blade tips. The blade edge is abraded, and slightly blunt where complete. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical probably occurring due to use not corrosion. Both faces of the blade are decorated with a trident motif whose single ridge which tapers towards the cutting edge. The sides of the blade are triangular with a casting seam which has been smoothed, but still forms a slight ridge. On one side face, at the junction of the blade and septum there is an integral loop.



The sides of the septum have a more prominent cast seam ridge, and the sides taper towards the butt of the palstave. There is a deep stop on both faces of the septum with a flange running down the sides on each face. The flanges on the side view taper in depth towards the butt. The butt is a slightly broken edge and obliquely angled therefore, but the break is not too recent. The floor of the rib-stop is corroded, on both side, which does not match the patina covering the remaining surface of the palstave.



The palstave has an incomplete well-developed shiny blue-green coloured patina.



The palstave measures 142.15mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.90mm wide from blade tip to blade tip, and 30.26mm thick across the stops. It weighs 370g.



The palstave is similar to Figure 22, No. 166 in Savoury (1980). The palstave is an early/primary Group III example which dates to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to c. 1500-1300 BC.

960305,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1725,-1500,"Early Bronze Age flanged axehead



The cast axehead is complete (with a length of 87.2mm and a weight of 129.3g) but has lost much of the original surface. The butt is straight and thin (with a width of 17mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The sides are near-straight and parallel as far as the position of the bevel on the faces (where the axe has a width of 21.6mm, a thickness of 11.5mm and a maximum depth, including flanges of 14.9mm). The sides are decorated with diagonal ridges and are slightly convex and gently rounded across their depths. Below the stop the sides widen gradually before the recurved blade tips (with a blade width of 50.3mm and a blade depth of 21.2mm). The blade edge is crescentic but slightly straightened around its centre, possibly because of wear. The flanges begin just below the butt and have a regular curve before returning to the on the blade. The flanges are comparatively shallow (reaching a maximum height above the septum of 2.6mm). The septum gradually thickens linearly to the position of the bevel (66mm below the butt), which has a slight curve. Beneath the bevel, decorative ridges echo the bevel at the top of the blade. The decoration is only now partially preserved where there is surface preservation but the decoration is likely to have been contained between the flanges on the top of the blade (for 18mm below the stop). The faces of the blade gradually converge towards the edge and slightly convex across their lengths. The surface has patches with a dark-brown patina, with pale-brown areas of surface loss with some both green and blue corrosion.



The height of the flanges (above 1.5mm) and overall form of the axe means it can be confidently classed as a low-flanged axe, datable to the Arreton assemblage (c.1725-1500 cal. BC)/Period 4 of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997). The axe can be classed as Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 72-75) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming



Needham (1983, 198) lists 179 Class 5 axes from southern Britain, indicating the broad currency of this axe type. In Wales, approximately 26 examples are currently known from both hoards and isolated contexts, with recent discoveries rapidly changing the image of how these axes were circulated. Class 5 axes are present in hoards from Menai Bridge, Anglesey (Savory 1980, 115, No.259), Llanover, Monmouthshire (NMGW-3F3BBC) and Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0B9997).

960311,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1000,"Late Bronze Age dirk of Penard or Wallington metalworking Industry, dated to c. 1300 - 1000BC



The cast dirk is complete but now distorted across the mid blade (with a distorted length of 282mm, a straightened length of approximately 288mm and a weight of 94.4g). The butt is flat-topped, slightly angled (23.0mm wide and 1.8mm thick). There are two rivet notches beneath the butt and on the sides (of 8.5mm diameter, with their midpoints 9.6mm beneath the butt and giving a minimum butt width of 17.5mm). There is no clear hilt mark but there is the suggestion of a curving mark from the top of the blade on the sides and arcing down onto the midrib. Beneath the rivet notches, the sides of the butt are straight and near parallel (with a width of 10.2mm where the butt has a thickness of 4.6mm), before converging at the top of the blade (with a width of 17mm and where the dirk has a maximum thickness of 5.0mm). The sides of the blade are near-straight and gradually convergent before narrowing to the tip. The blade has a flattened mid-section rib (6.5mm wide). The blade facets are concave (4mm - 6mm wide) and the original blade edge is eroded and now lost. There is differential wear on one side, above the tip (for approximately 10cm above the tip). The dirk has a black patina, well preserved over much of the blade but lost at the position of the interior bend, perhaps suggesting the damage to the blade occurred post-deposition. Otherwise the blade has a grey-green to pale-brown corrosion.



The weapon is of Group IV and the hilt form and blade profile would suggest a Type Appleby dirk, as defined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p. 74)[1]. The rectangular form to the butt with upright sides would further suggest 'Variant Barnes' (ibid. p 76-7) of Type Appleby. However it is unclear whether the notches are cast into the hilt or the weapon was damaged and reworked from rivet holes. If the notches were original, then it may suggest a slightly later weapon of Type Stuntey, or similar, although these types often have more trapezoidal butt forms.

The cast dirk is near-complete, with some peripheral damage (with a length of 258mm and a weight of 77.5g). The top of the butt is flat and thin, with curved corners (with a butt width of 27.5mm and a thickness of 0.7mm). Beneath the butt the rivet-notches are a little irregular and of V-shaped profile (with a depth of 4.0mm - 4.4mm, a width of 7mm and are 18.8mm apart). Beneath the rivet-notches the sides widen to the shoulders, with some damage (with a width of 34.0mm, where the butt is 4.1mm thick). The edge at the top of the blade has a convex curve (for 13mm) before the near-straight edge, which gradually converges towards the tip (with a width of 18mm below the curved sides). The blade is thickest at the top of the blade (with a thickness of 5.0mm) and has a flat-topped midrib, curving from the shoulder and gradually narrowing until it defines a rib and produces a lozengic section to the blade (c. 35mm above the tip). There is no vertical hilt ridge but there is a hilt mark evident on one face, which has a slight convex curve from just below the shoulders. The blade has a gentle concave profile, each side of the midrib and sections of the blade edge are preserved. Much of the damage to the blade edge damage appears to be more recent although a few of the notches are patinated. Subtle striations are discernible, mostly running along the blade edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with some pitting and bright-green corrosion. The top of the butt has rounded hammering ridges from working and thinning and the butt has considerably less surface finishing than the blade.

Discussion: A number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered, with distinct variants identifiable.

They are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although recess in the body of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. This was possibly something such as a dagger handle, although the absence of evidence makes this conjectural. Another suggestion has been a Scabbard Chape, in which case the object would be the other way up.

From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117).

961011,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"Plain Pegged Spearhead with flame-shaped blade of Type 11 A - largely complete, two fragments (metal-detector find, number 9)

	




Dimensions: Surviving length approx. 195.0mm; max. blade width 46.6mm; max. blade length approx. 154.0mm; surviving socket length approx. 41.0mm; surviving external diameter of socket at break 25.9mm; depth of socket - unknown, as obscured by concretion; diameter of surviving peg hole approx. 5.7mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 190.2g. 



Dimensions of small socket fragment: max. surviving length 10.3mm; surviving width 7.5mm; thickness 1.5mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 0.4g. 



Combined weight (prior to conservation) 190.6g. 



This is a largely complete Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a flame-shaped blade, which is now missing its lower socket and tip-end. Originally, the spearhead was probably around 220-230mm long. The point of maximum width on this blade is low and the blade edges follow a smooth curve from the blade/socket junction to the spear tip. The spearhead mid-rib is angled, providing a sub-lozengic cross-section. The mid-rib sides have very slightly concave profiles on the lower blade and near where the midrib merges into the top of the socket. The blade has a bevel which is a maximum of 3.5-4.0mm wide, surviving best on the lower blade sides. On one side of the socket, half of a peg-hole survives at the lower break, being approximately 5.7mm in diameter. A small socket wall fragment was detached and embedded within soil remaining inside the socket when reported and this was separated as the excess soil was removed in the conservation laboratory. The spearhead shows evidence of deliberate narrow blade damage in antiquity. On one face and mid-way down the mid-rib, there is an angled narrow blade impact. This has revealed the cavity down the hollow centre of the rib, also causing the whole spearhead blade to have been bent in side-section. Secondly, on the socket, there is evidence of one, possibly two, similar angled impacts with a narrow-bladed weapon or tool, causing a break and distortion in the socket wall. Finally, on one upper blade edge, there is a deep nick in the blade bevel, approximately 1.5mm deep and 1.5-2.0mm wide, which looks to have been made in antiquity. On both sides, there are areas of surface scraping, as if by glancing blows. One of these has revealed fresh bronze, suggesting this damage may be recent. The spearhead has a dark green patina on the blade, merging to brown on the socket. The upper blade surfaces are part covered with green and blue surface corrosion concretions.




Sword blade of Carp's Tongue Type - fragment (metal-detector find 3)



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 133.2mm; max. blade width 45.5mm; blade width near break 1 42.8mm; blade width near break 2 42.5mm; max. blade thickness 8.7mm; width mid-ridge 14.0-15.0mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 160.0g. 



This is a blade fragment of a bronze straight-sided sword. The sword has a rounded midrib, precisely defined by single grooves, 0.2-0.3mm wide, which follow the outline of the blade. The blade edges are defined by blade bevels, approximately 3.5mm wide. In places, there are striations along the blade bevel, indicating the blade edges were prepared for use. Original blade edges survive in short sections, however the edges and bevels are damaged through fragility and corrosion. Near one of the blade breaks, there is local distortion of the blade, the blade being distinctly bent in side view. This suggests the bending was caused, as pressure was being applied to snap the sword. The blade has a grey-green patina, with areas of blue corrosion surface concretions evident. The concretions are particularly marked and thick on one face (approximately 2.5mm thick), suggesting the blade may have been in direct contact with another bronze artefact in the hoard, as buried.




South Wales Type socketed axe - complete (metal-detector find 8)



Dimensions: Length 101.9mm; blade width 53.4mm; width body below loop 41.6mm; external mouth dimensions 49.1mm (side to side) by 39.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 34.7mm (side to side) by 26.6mm (front to back); dimensions runner stub (1) 7.2 by 3.7mm, height 0.3mm; dimensions runner scar (1) 6.4mm by 3.2mm; depth of socket approx. 68.0mm; width loop 6.1-6.9mm; weight (prior to conservation) 388.8g. 



A complete, bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a near rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides, splaying slightly towards the blade end. The loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding and is narrow. The runner stubs and scars are barely visible around the mouth, however slight ridges on the front and back sides, and a slight scar on the loop side, suggest that this axe was probably cast using a four-runner casting technology. The exterior outline of the mouth is sub-rectangular and the interior outline is slightly more curved and approaching sub-oval in shape. On one side, on the upper mouth moulding beneath the mouth, there is a slight indent, as if the bronze has been cast slightly above a defined edge in the mould part. Three longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, though now partly obscured by surface corrosion deposits. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering after casting. The blade bevel is largely obscured by corrosion deposits, however there are slight striations both parallel and at right-angles to the blade edge in one small area, suggesting that the axe may have been sharpened for use. On both sides of the axe, there are green and blue patches of corrosion products, while the original surfaces have a grey-green patina. On one lower blade face, there are two small areas of thick blue-green concretions with flattened top surfaces, which may once have attached to the flat face of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group.




South Wales Type socketed axe - complete (small find number 7)



Dimensions: Length 120.1mm; blade width 55.1mm; width body below loop (including flashes) 47.0mm; width body below loop (excluding flashes) approx. 42.0mm; external mouth dimensions (including flashes) 61.2mm (side to side) by 47.3mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 37.0mm (side to side) by 31.6mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 9.0 by 3.6mm; height 0.1mm; (2) 8.0 by 4.0mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 9.2 by 4.4mm; height 0.3mm; (4) 9.6 by 3.4mm; height 0.1mm; width loop 4.8-5.2mm; depth of socket approx. 79.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 458.5g. 



This is a complete and long, slender bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. This heavy axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides and there is no splaying or recurving near the blade edges. The loop is high and narrow, and descends from the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degree apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Three prominent and longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, extending nearly two-thirds of the way down the axe faces. Though near parallel to each other, they are not quite straight with very slight meanders evident. It is evident that this axe was never prepared for use and in just out of the mould state. The casting flashes down both sides are prominent and very sharp and the loop was never used. The blade edge was never hammered or sharpened for use and there is excess around the mouth top, which was never filed or hammered down. Large areas of the axe's surfaces are covered with blue corrosion products, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. On one upper face, there is a particularly prominent area of corrosion with flattened upper surfaces, which may once have attached to the flat faces of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. The original surfaces of this axe have a grey-green patina.




South Wales Type socketed axe - fragment (metal-detector find 6)



Dimensions: Surviving length 65.6mm; width body below loop 41.7mm; external mouth dimensions 50.2mm (side to side) by 42.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 35.3mm (side to side) by 29.5mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 13.4 by 4.8mm; height 1.3mm; (2) 11.7 by 6.1mm; height 1.5mm; (3) 12.3 by 3.0mm; height 0.2mm; (4) 10.7 by 3.5mm; height 0.1mm; width loop 5.1-6.6mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 135.9g. 



This is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has straight but slightly divergent sides, but the lower body and blade end is missing. The high loop descends from the under-side of the mouth-moulding and is narrow. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in plan. Three prominent, longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, while the face edges are slightly curved, rather than angular. The lower break edge, in plan, indicates there was a misalignment in the placing of the internal mould-piece relative to the outer mould pair during casting, with one face-wall being notably thicker than the other. On the non-loop side of the axe, near the break edge and in the area of particular wall thinning, there is a crack or split in the metal, which meanders upwards onto one of the faces. This suggests that the axe may have failed and broken during use. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. The axe has a grey-green patina and there are small localised encrustations of green and blue corrosion products on the faces and mouth moulding.




South Wales Type socketed axe - fragment (small find number 6)



Dimensions: Surviving length 60.8mm; width body below loop 37.7mm; external mouth dimensions 48.0mm (side to side) by 40.8mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 31.0mm (side to side) by 25.7mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 8.5 by 2.8mm; height 0.7mm; (2) 8.0 by 2.6mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 8.5 by 4.0mm; height 1.0mm; (4) 8.1 by 2.8mm; height 0.5mm; width loop 4.1-5.2mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 179.2g. 



This is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The upper sides are slightly concave and slightly divergent. The loop is narrow and low, emerging significantly below the underside of the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four prominent runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Three weakly defined and slightly divergent, longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. The casting flashes down both sides are prominent but blunted, indicating that they were hammered or filed down when the axe was prepared for use. On one face, near the break edge, there is a concave distortion and narrowing of the socket aperture, suggesting that this axe may have been struck with a blunt tool before being buried in the ground although no clear impact scar is visible on the surface remaining. The axe surfaces have extensive patches of blue corrosion products over upper faces, sides and mouth, suggesting that this axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.




South Wales Variant Type socketed axe - complete (metal-detector find 2)



Dimensions: Length 80.9mm; blade width 49.2mm; width body below loop 37.2mm; external mouth dimensions 46.2mm (side to side) by 40.1mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 28.5mm (side to side) by 23.8mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 8.8 by 5.2mm; height 0.5mm; (2) 8.6 by 5.9mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 10.5 by 5.7mm; height 0.8mm; (4) 7.5 by 4.5mm; height 0.2mm; width loop 4.8-5.6mm; depth of socket approx. 62.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 255.2g. 



This is a complete and small bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular-shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly straight and divergent sides, which splay outwards markedly near the blade edge. The loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding and is narrow. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Five very prominent, longitudinal and ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, extending a little over half way down the length of the axe faces. The central three ribs are parallel, while the outer ribs define and follow the face edges and are slightly divergent. The casting seams are visible though not prominent, suggesting hammering or filing as preparation of the axe. Striations on the blade-bevel, mostly running parallel with the blade-edge indicate that the axe was sharpened for use. Thick and prominent patches of blue corrosion products are evident on the faces and loop-side of the axe and suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. It is possible that the flat topped surfaces on the thick corrosion products present on one face of the axe may once have attached to the flat faces of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. The original surfaces of this axe have a green patina.




Ribbed socketed axe of South Wales Variant, with similarities to Type Sompting, Variant Roseberry Topping - complete (metal-detector find 4)



Dimensions: Length 114.5mm; blade width 50.5mm; width body below loop 37.2mm; external mouth dimensions 47.5mm (side to side) by 45.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 32.1mm (side to side) by 30.5mm (front to back); depth of socket approx. 84.0mm; width loop 9.6-11.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 400.0g. 



This is a complete, large and heavy bronze socketed axe of blocky but slender proportions, with a pronounced, curved and onset collar, and an angular rectangular cross-section. The sides are slightly concave and divergent, giving a slightly flared form and with slight, but even widening near the blade ends. A wide and thick loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding. The external and internal outlines of the mouth are sub-square in plan and the axe has a deep front to back mouth. There are no clear runner stubs or scars evident around the mouth top. Five longitudinal and very pronounced ribs descend from the underside of the mouth moulding on each face, extending down two thirds of the length of the faces. The central three ribs are near parallel, while the outer ribs define and follow the face edges and are slightly divergent. On one face, there is a linear projecting ridge, between two ribs on the lower loop side, suggesting a flaw in the surface of the mould, from which the axe was cast. In side view, one of the faces has a marked 'bulge' or convex curvature half way down the face, suggesting an oddly shaped mould-half. The casting seams down each side of the axe are prominent but blunted, suggesting the seams were rapidly hammered down as the axe was prepared for use. On the blade bevel, there are striations parallel with the blade edge, indicating the axe was prepared for use. There are areas of concreted corrosion products on the sides and faces of the axe, of both green and blue colour, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before being buried. On one blade facet and on the lower loop side there are areas of concretion with markedly smooth upper surfaces, suggesting that this axe may have been placed immediately beside, and above or below other artefacts within the hoard group. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.




Croxton Type socketed axe - fragment (small find number 8) 



Dimensions: Surviving length 52.7mm; width body below loop 35.7mm; external mouth dimensions 40.7 mm (side to side) by 36.6mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 30.5mm (side to side) by 25.1mm (front to back); width loop 6.8-7.8mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 114.8g. 



This is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a deep and onset collar and a sub-rectangular shaped body in cross- section. The upper sides are straight and slightly divergent. The loop is relatively high and wide, descending from within the lower part of the mouth moulding. The mouth moulding is slightly concave and everted in side profile, with no thickening or globularity evident near the mouth. The mouth top is flat but slightly angled with a raised inner edge and the exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. No runner scars or stubs are visible on the mouth. On one face, three longitudinal, narrow and strongly convergent ribs are visible, descending from the lower margin of the collar. These are poorly spaced at their origin, with one rib on the loop-side much more widely spaced away from the other two, descending from far over onto the non-loop side. On the reverse side, the ribs are largely obscured by surface corrosion products, though the upper section of one convergent rib on the loop-side is visible. The casting seams are visible down each side of the axe, but have been carefully filed down. One side and mouth of the axe is heavily encrusted with blue corrosion products, suggesting the axe was burnt immediately before burial. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.

Combined weight (prior to conservation) 172.5g. 



This is an unusual, largely complete and slender, bronze socketed axe, with a tear and distortion down the non-loop side, from the mouth and along the casting seam. The axe has an everted mouth with a trumpet form and a deep onset collar. The mouth is damaged and distorted, but appears to have been near circular in external plan, though slightly sub-rectangular in its internal shape, and the mouth looks to have once had a deep front-to-back mouth. The mouth dimensions cannot now be accurately measured due to later damage and distortion. A low-set and slender loop, with a markedly rectangular shaped bar, descends from beneath the collar.



The upper socket is straight-sided the sides converging slightly. Half way down the axe, there is a distinct step and change of angle in the side profile, where the lower blade widens on both sides to give a step-waist effect. The slender lower blade has concave sides, widening to give a flaring blade form. This appears to be a composite socketed axe, where a socket has been cast on to a re-worked Winged Axe (or just possibly a Late Palstave). The upper face margins of the socket are defined by distinct single linear grooves ending in line with a square-ended ledge-stop across each mid-face. This is located 8-9mm below the point of the widening step visible on each side, thereby creating an overlapping join between the winged-axe blade-end and the cast on socket. The casting seams are prominent, but flattened indicating rapid filing or hammering down and the seams on the socket and blade end are in exact alignment.



The socket and mouth was split down its non-loop side along the casting seam, suggesting an outward pushing force, causing a split and distortion. Towards the base of the side split are lateral tears extending round to each face. A small mouth fragment from the non-loop side has conjoins with both mouth breaks, indicating that the axe is complete, but damaged. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina, though with areas of thick blue concretions on upper faces, one lower blade and side and inside the socket, suggesting the axe was burnt immediately before burial. At the base of the tapering sub-rectangular shaped socket, there is a green corroded concretion down one side.




Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Westow / Class D - complete (metal-detector find 5)



Dimensions: Length 107.7mm; surviving blade width 44.8mm; width body below loop 27.3mm; external mouth dimensions 32.7mm (side to side) by 31.6mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 23.4mm (side to side) by 23.0mm (front to back); dimensions of probable runner stub 6.7 by 3.5mm; height 0.7mm; dimensions of probable runner scar 6.0 by 3.0mm; depth 1.0mm; depth of socket approx. 73.0mm; width loop 5.2-5.6mm; weight (prior to conservation) 204.5g. 



This is a complete and slender bronze socketed axe with six facets and a deep, double mouth moulding. The sides are straight and slightly divergent with pronounced splaying and recurving at the blade-ends. The low and slender loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding. The upper margin of the mouth moulding is defined by two curved horizontal ridges separated by a narrow groove and likewise, the lower margin also has a pair of curved horizontal ridges separated by a narrow groove. The two pairs of ridges are themselves separated by a wider, slightly recessed and concave band, making for a complex and unusual mouth moulding in combination. The external and internal outlines of the mouth are circular in plan shape. On one face side of the mouth top, there is a noticeable projection and on the opposing side, at 180 degrees to this, there is a corresponding scar, suggesting the existence of one runner-stub and one runner-scar and the use of a two-runner casting technology. The facet edges on the axe have rounded edges. The casting seams down each side are prominent but blunted, suggesting they were only rapidly hammered or filed when prepared for use. On the blade bevel there are striations running both parallel and at right angles to the blade edge, indicating that the blade was prepared for use. The faces, sides and mouth moulding of the axe are covered with blue corrosion products, suggesting that the axe was burnt immediately before burial. On one upper face, an area of blue corrosion product has a markedly flat top surface, which may once have attached to the flat face of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. On the blade end, the original surfaces have a green patina, while on the upper faces and mouth, the original surfaces have a grey-green patina.




Small plain socketed axe similar to Type Portree / Eogan Class 2A - complete



(metal-detector find 7) 



Dimensions: Length 74.3mm; blade width 47.8mm; width body below loop 32.3mm; external mouth dimensions 39.3mm (side to side) by 32.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 30.1mm (side to side) by 25.3mm (front to back); depth of socket approx. 59.0mm; width loop 5.3-6.0mm; weight (prior to conservation ) 150.5g. 



This is a complete small, plain socketed axe of bronze, with a relatively broad body. The axe has a sub-rectangular sectioned body and mouth. The axe has a deep onset collar, which is flaring or trumpet shaped in profile. A low set and narrow loop emerges from the underside of the collar. The sides of the axe are slightly concave and diverge slightly, with marked expansion and recurving of the blade edge. There are no runner scars or stubs evident around the mouth top. The casting seams down each side of the axe are visible, but have been hammered or filed down before use. On the upper blade faces, there are blunt hammer mark depressions, indicating the expanded blade was worked before use. Striations running parallel with the blade-edge also indicate the blade was sharpened for use. The axe has a grey-green patina, with thick blue and green surface concretions evident in patches on the collar and blade surfaces. The blue concretions suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before being buried. On one blade bevel, there is a particularly thick area of blue surface concretion, with a markedly smooth and flat upper surface, suggesting this axe may have been placed immediately beside and above or below other artefacts in the hoard group.




Curved socket wall, undiagnostic - small fragment (small find number 1)



Dimensions: max. surviving length 11.0mm; max. surviving width 6.1mm; thickness 1.3mm; surviving weight 0.3g. 



This is a small bronze curved socket wall fragment of undiagnostic form. Although probably once part of one of the artefacts in the hoard, no conjoin may now be discerned, the breaks being sub-rounded and not fresh looking. The curvature of the fragment is consistent with a socket wall. The original surfaces of the fragment have a grey-green patina, thought the breaks have powdery light green edges.",,3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2015-04-10T23:00:00Z,2015-04-16T23:00:00Z,2015TW07,,,,,,,1,Mark Lodwick,Adam Gwilt,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Grosmont,SO3515,GPS (From FLO),51.82981621,-2.94463804,NMGW-B5E854,,73798.jpg,Late Bronze Age Hoard,National Museum Wales ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/73798.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1063720.jpg

Discussion: 



The bracelets/armrings described above can be best paralleled by objects from Ornament Horizon hoards of the Taunton phase (c.1400-1300 BC). During this phase many bracelets are more elaborate in the form or decoration (e.g. Rowlands 1971), and the Rockbourne examples are plain. They are, nevertheless, well paralleled by finds from the Monkswood hoard, Somerset (Smith 1959, Inv Arch GB. 42 2(1) & 2(2), see nos. 3-7), the Brading Marsh hoard (Isle of Wight), Hampshire (Rowlands 1976, 238), and Ebbesbourne Wake hoard, Wiltshire (Rowlands 1976, 271-21). For wider discussion of the ornament horizon and deposition of bracelets/armrings see Roberts (2007) and Wilkin (2017). 



Only fragments 1 & 2 have precise find spots, with these being very widely dispersed within the same field. Despite this, it is unlikely that three bronze age armlets of similar form would be separately deposited within such a small area, and on the balance of probability the group either represent a hoard disturbed by later cultivation, or were deposited as part of the same process. 



Conclusion:



As a find of three copper alloy objects of prehistoric  date, objects Nos. 1-3 qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002)

The metal has a dark green delaminated patina and is worn. The fragment is 47.5mm long, 37.2mm wide, 15.4mm thick and weighs 57.3g.



Due to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,57.3,,,15.4,47.5,1,Rebecca Griffiths,Rebecca Griffiths,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Ryedale,Kirkbymoorside,SE7185,From finder,54.25575779,-0.91167063,YORYM-DFEEAB,,GOC0003.jpg,Bronze Age : Socketed Axehead,York Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/GOC0003.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1064250.jpg
961492,Scabbard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A cast copper-alloy Late Bronze Age 'bag-shaped' dagger scabbard chape associated with the Carp's Tongue complex. On close examination, the chape is formed from a single sheet of copper alloy, beaten and folded over to form the bulbus crescent shape. A section of the back has been lost in antiquity, the front, which remains intact, has three rivet fixing holes. There is the remnant of one hole, to the broken rear of the chape. The surface has a mid-green roughened patina.



Dimensions. 30.84mm wide, 20.39mm deep and the metal is 0.54mm thick, weighing 6.6gm.



Similar bag-shaped chapes on the database include: NARC-5DEF37, NMS-99FB70, HAMP-095061, WILT-D4F151, SUSS-C65251, and DOR-BD9AED. The latter example explains:



A similar, although undecorated, chape is recorded in WILT-D4F151 and another in a Bronze Age Hoard (SUSS-C65251) where Neil Wilkin notes The two bag-shaped chapes (Nos. 3-4) are of a type present in several hoards in South-east England. They are primarily distributed in South-east England and in Northern France, with a small number of outliers in Ireland (O'Connor 1980: 190; List 161; Gerloff 2004, fig. 17.9, 3). Parallels for the bag-shaped chapes can be found in the Mininis Bay hoard, Kent (Ibid., fig.59, no. 12), and a similar bag-shaped chape with two peg holes is part of the Salisbury hoard (British Museum: 1961,006.7; 1998,0901.149). Bag-shaped chapes are often associated with the Carp's Tongue (CT) complex/horizon (O'Connor 1980, 190-91), although Gerloff (2004, 146) notes that their distribution is somewhat peripheral to their principal distribution areas. It is possible that the blade tip (No. 5) belongs to either a Ewart Park or a Carp's Tongue sword, both are types that are closely associated with hoards and deposits that also include bag-shaped chapes (Ibid.).

961742,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 17.1 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (8.6 mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. Potential decoration is present on one side as four circular depressions around the mid point. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 34.3 mm (2.6 mm thick). The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. 



It measures 80.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.3 mm, width at the butt is 17.1 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.6 mm. It weighs 77.7 grams.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

961746,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Descriptions 




Socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 24.5mm; surviving width 50.8mm; width at break 42.0mm; thickness at break 12mm; weight 54.8g.



This is the lower blade and cutting edge of a socketed axe, broken across the internal socket aperture in antiquity. The cutting edge is worn and damaged so the original edge no longer survives, but curved shape and the curved expanding nature of the sides suggest it may have originally possessed slightly flared tips. The incomplete nature of this axe means it cannot be definitely assigned a type.



The break has occurred at the point that the socket opening began, though only about 3mm of the socket wall survives above this. This is nonetheless sufficient to demonstrate that the axe was cast with a misaligned core, as indicated by the differential thickness of the socket walls on each face (5.4mm and 2.4mm); this may have influenced the breakage. There is a slightly bowing inwards on the face with the thinner socket wall, which may represent an impact blow.



The fragment is heavily pitted with green corrosion, though retains a patchy bronze patina particularly around the edges.




Socketed axe or palstave fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 21.8mm; surviving width 44.2mm; thickness 10.4-14mm; weight 59.6g.



This is a thick copper alloy fragment, roughly sub-rectangular in plan and elliptical in section, tapering in side profile to one edge. The object has broken across both the long edges in antiquity, but the shorter sides appear to be largely original. The overall form is suggestive of the lower blade of an axe, which is supported by the remains of a casting seam on one side, though the fragment lacks any diagnostic features that might allow it to be assigned to a specific type. In the thicker break there are possible faint remnants of a socket aperture, though this feature is not conclusive. Alternatively, the thick nature of the fragment could infer a palstave.



The fragment is covered by a combination of smooth silvery patina and green corrosion pitting. There are also patches of bronze patina particularly around the edges.




Jet - one runner



Dimensions: top surface length 26.0mm; top surface width 21.5mm; maximum height 36.5mm; weight 48.0g.



This is a roughly oval-shaped conical jet with a thick single runner extending from the pouring reservoir. The upper surface is rough and uneven, representing the dross created by metal as it cools while the runner is smooth. The upper surface is largely level, but the sides around the reservoir are slightly raised; this is a natural result of the cooling process. There is no distinction in the transition between the reservoir and the runner, suggesting the metal was poured into a mould with a wide conical opening. The runner tapers to a thick point with slightly concave sides from the reservoir.



The jet is pitted with green corrosion, though largely retains a bronze patina.




Incomplete jet



Dimensions: top surface length 22.8mm; top surface width 19.9mm; maximum height 16.8mm; weight 21.5g.



This is the pouring reservoir of a broadly oval jet, with a rough, uneven upper surface, representing metal dross, and a dip in the metal towards the centre. The reservoir narrows with slightly



convex sides towards the runner, creating an overall 'bowl' shape, indicating the shape of the mould opening. However, the jet has broken at the transition from the reservoir to the runner(s). It is thus unclear whether this would form one or two runners.



The jet is covered in a rough grey patina, intermitted with patches of bright green corrosion or bronze disease.




Probable rapier fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 49.6mm; hilt width 24.1mm; hilt thickness 5.2mm; butt width 15.8; butt thickness 4.4mm; width at break 14.3mm; thickness at break 4.2mm; weight 27.0g.



This is a small copper alloy fragment of a probable hilt from a blade, broken across the upper blade. The fragment is quite worn, making diagnostic features difficult to ascertain. However, the fragment shows signs of rounded asymmetrical hilt shoulders that taper down to a narrow blade with a biconvex section, which is characteristic of a rapier. Additionally, above the shoulders the fragment tapers inwards to two possible notches before projecting to a rounded butt. It is thus likely this piece once belonged to a rapier.



The object has broken across the upper blade in antiquity and the break is now worn. There are no associated marks or casting flaws.



The fragment is worn and pitted with green corrosion, though retains a patchy bronze patina particularly around the edges.","This hoard of objects can certainly be dated to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) and probably to the Late Bronze Age (1100-800BC), however in its fragmentary state, the artefacts lack closely diagnostic elements to allow conclusive dating to a particular period within this broader frame. Many fragmentary hoards were deposited during the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age and it is likely, on a balance of probability, the hoard dates to this period.



Broken socketed axes (such as No.1 above) are a feature of Late Bronze Age hoards, typically dating to the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 cal. BC) (Needham et al. 1997). It is common for axes to be broken across the point of the internal socket aperture and examples of similar breakage patterns can be seen on four examples in the St. Nicholas hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt n.d.). The slight bowing on one face may indicate this piece was deliberately broken before deposition.



The second axe fragment (No.2 above) is harder to interpret because while it is likely to have belonged to a socketed axe, the thick nature of the fragment, and lack of any additional features, means one cannot rule out the possibility that it once belonged to a palstave. This might be further supported by the narrow nature of the blade, which is a feature of both Transitional and Late palstaves (Smith 1959). Transitional palstave have been dated to the Penard-Wilburton phases (c.1300-1000 BC), while Late palstaves held currency in the Wilburton to Ewart Park phases (c.1100-800 BC) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 145-163; Needham et al. 1997). Given the other associations in this hoard, it is most likely that this fragment once belonged either to a socketed axe or to a Late palstave, both types circulating during the Late Bronze Age. Complete examples of Late palstaves were found in Late Bronze Age hoards from Colwinston and Tal y garn 1, while two palstave butt fragments were present in the Penllyn hoard, all Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt and Lodwick 2003; Gwilt et al. 2012a; Gwilt et al. 2015). In total, about 60 examples of Late palstaves are known from Wales in hoards and as single finds.



The jets (Nos 3, 4) represent the excess reservoirs of metal at the top of moulds and are a by-product of the casting process. Jets are commonly incorporated into hoards during the Late Bronze Age, yet are rarely present within hoards of Early and Middle Bronze Age date. The generic nature of these two jets means the objects they produced cannot be determined. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets are more typically represented in hoard associations dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.920-800 BC). They are now known from numerous Ewart Park phase hoards in Wales including the St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), Cowbridge (Vale of Glamorgan) and Glascoed (Monmouthshire) hoards (Gwilt and Lodwick 2002; Lodwick and Gwilt 2002; Gwilt et al. 2011; 2012b).



The final object in the hoard, the possible rapier (No.5), is an interesting element. Rapiers hold their main currency in the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC), with the last phase of their production ending in the Penard phase (1300-1150 BC), when they were superseded by developments in sword-making (Burgess and Gerloff 1981, 113). Although worn, enough survives of this fragment to suggest it belonged to a Group IV rapier, as indicated by the side notches, slender shoulders and small butt (ibid., 62). Group IV rapiers belong to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age but continued in use into the Wilburton phase at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the centuries from 1300 to 1000 BC (ibid., 106-109). These are the most common of the British rapier forms and they were also commonly reworked later during their use lives, often being found as broken and undiagnostic fragments, suggesting that some remained in use and circulation over a long time period. It is entirely feasible therefore, that a rapier made towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age could remain in use and circulation into the Late Bronze Age, only being deposited in a hoard then. In Wales, a possible Group IV rapier fragment was deposited with fragments of two Late palstaves, a spearhead and a flat plate at Penllyn, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt et al. 2015).



The consistent patina and corrosion of the components in this hoard suggest they all entered the ground at around the same time. These were then likely dispersed by historical and modern agricultural processes. The majority of the objects (Nos 1-4) are consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, probably the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 BC), when the burial of fragmentary hoards was a common practice. Examples from Wales include hoards from Tal-y-garn 1 and 2, Colwinston (all Vale of Glamorgan), and Glascoed (Monmouthsire) (Lodwick and Gwilt 2002; Gwilt and Lodwick 2003a; 2003b; Gwilt et al. 2012a). The rapier fragment predates the other objects in the hoard, in its manufacture, by up to 300 years, but it is likely it represents an old object that remained in circulation use and re-use, or perhaps as a piece of scrap metal, until the Late Bronze Age. Alternatively, it may represent the rediscovery of an older deposit that was then reburied. The proximity of the rapier to the other finds within a three metre square area, coupled with the lack of contemporary deposits in the surrounding area and the consistent condition of the artefacts means that on the balance of probability the rapier can be considered associated with the other material. In terms of size and composition, the Mawr hoard is most closely comparable with the Penllyn hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt et al. 2015).



The find-spot is located on a north-facing promontory about 163m above sea level and overlooking the River Cathan to the north-east, which feeds westwards into the larger River Loughor. A preliminary search of the Historic Environment Record revealed no other Bronze Age or prehistoric features recorded from the immediate area

961873,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"1. Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B 



Dimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.



This is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.



2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.



This is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.



Fragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.



3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)



Dimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.



This is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.



There are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.



4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)



Dimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.



This is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.



There are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.



5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D 



Dimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.



This is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.



The sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.



The molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).



The axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.



6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)



Dimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.



These are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. 



The socket end (visible on fragments 6 & 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.



Fragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,



with a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.



All fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.



9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)



Dimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.



This is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.



There is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.



10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11



Dimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.



This is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.



The spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.



The fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.



11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable sword



Dimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.



This is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.



The breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.



The fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.



12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner form



Dimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.



This is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.



The jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.



13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner form



Dimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. 



This a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.



The jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.



14. Copper alloy annular ring



Dimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.



This is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.



The ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.



15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning cap



Dimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.



This is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.



The object is covered in a dark green patina.



This object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. 



16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slag



Dimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.



This is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.



This piece is covered in green corrosion.



This slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards.","Bibliography

Description: The axehead has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle, with two concave faces flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentic cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It is proceed by a double raised collar. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have not been worked down and remain fairly prominent, particularly towards the collar end. The blade edge has some wear but remains in good conditions. The side loop remains on one side. The axehead has a dark greenish well formed patina with some slightly lighter mottling in places, but is fairly restricted although may be areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.

It has a lenticular longitudinal cross-section and rectangular horizontal cross-section. The tang end is flat and measures 13.5x1.7mm. It expands to 18.7mm wide (and 8.5mm thick) at the stop-ridge, beyond which the edges of the blade below flare to a cutting edge 29.9mm wide (and 2.3mm thick). The cutting edge is slightly curved and the very edge is chamfered to both faces. Otherwise the edges of the object are sharp and c.90 degrees.

The patina is bluey-green in colour and smooth to touch.

Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in plan and lozenge in section. The base of the socket can be seen at the broken end of the spear.



The metal has a dark green/brown patina and is worn. The spear is 57.9mm long, 22.7mm wide, 9.7mm thick and weighs 24g.



As this object represents only a small fragment of the spearhead it is not possible to classify the form of the complete object with complete confidence. However, the object's apparent lack of a pronounced midrib might be indicative of the 'hollow blade' type, Davis Group 12, and it is this classification which is tentatively suggested.

962778,Torc,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Solid gold armring with punched decoration. The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap. There is noticeable wear to the outer edge of the object as the surface is smoother and the punched dots are much shallower.



Length: 82.09mm



Width: 68.57mm



Diameter: 11.55mm



Weight: 311g





Discussion:



The armring is similar in form to those of the Tullydonnell hoard from County Donegal, which were dated to c. 1200 - 800 BC. A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.

963082,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"A complete copper alloy miniature flat axe or possibly a chisel, 67.2 mm in length and dating to the early to late early Bronze Age (2050 BC- 1700BC).



The axe has straight sides, expanding into a cutting edge, which is curved and 36.6 mm across, with a cutting edge around 3 mm thick. The butt end narrows to 26.9 mm in width and is slightly convex. There are flanges on both sides of the shaft. The profile of the axe is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval with a maximum thickness at the centre of 13.2 mm. Weight 130.45 gsm



The surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy.



Notes:



This object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg.HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).



Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.

964016,Finger Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1500,180,"An incomplete copper alloy spiral finger-ring. It is circular and formed by two coils of an oval cross-sectioned metal wire; both ends taper and flatten slightly. The patina is corroded in patches of dark and pale green. The outside surface is very abraded and heavily pitted, while the inside of the ring is smoother.



It is difficult or impossible to tell Bronze Age from Iron Age from Roman spiral finger-rings. It is possible that earlier examples of prehistoric finger-rings may have more turns around the finger and be thicker than later examples. It is therefore a possibility that this finger-ring can be dated to the Bronze Age period.

Description: The fragment is irregularly shaped heavily worn and patinated. It represents part of the body and socket of the object and is crescentic in cross-section. The rim is raised and triangular in cross-section, it has incised herringbone decoration. The breaks are relatively worn likely indicating archaic damage. It has an even bright green patination.

Discussion: This fragment is very limited in size and makes exact identification difficult. From the form of the fragment it seems likely that the object is a socket gauge of some description although this would make a very large example. In regards size it seems more in line with socketed axes but the only group with similar, albeit cast decoration are Axes with Rope Moulded Mouth type which are known from Scotland (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos. 1033-1037) with one known from Northern England LANCUM-D99FD1 so this link is tenuous.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,23.57,,,12.13,33.95,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Swale,Sheldwich,TR0055,Generated from computer mapping software,51.25907021,0.86501887,KENT-EAC37E,,KENTEAC37E.jpg,Ba fragment,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTEAC37E.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1066683.jpg

Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There is a large rectangular rim and recess at the outer edge which could potentially represent a socket from a socketed tool that has been melted into the ingot. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The artefact is heavily rolled resulting in abrasion to all surfaces. What remains is globular in form (teardrop shaped) with an oval cross section. It is probably one of a pair of pointed drop-shaped elements conjoined by an integrally cast bar. The remains of a heavily eroded rectangular bar is present on one side of the droplet. The external edges are all decorated with multiple longitudinal grooves The metal is a mid-green in colour with a smooth patina.



Notes:

These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45, BERK-C3E5A3 and BH-AA1CBE. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.

965441,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Ribbed socketed axe fragment, probable South Wales type



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 48.6mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 40.9mm; thickness of mouth 5.3-7.2mm; width of upper loop 4.0mm; dimensions runner-stubs (1) near loop 8.3 by 2.9mm; height 0.1mm; (2) face 6.6 by 2.9mm; height 0.1mm; surviving weight 39.4g. 



This is an upper face and partial mouth fragment of a ribbed bronze socketed axe. The axe has a collar, which in profile is vertical rather than everted, with a slightly convex shape and slight rounding at the upper and lower edge margins. A narrow upper loop-stub is present, which is high-set and descends from the collar. The mouth is wide and flat, with two runner-stubs evident beside the loop-stub and at the centre of the axe face. The external and internal plan shape of the mouth was once sub-rectangular with rounded corners. Two poorly defined decorative ribs may be seen on this small fragment, descending from the collar down the upper face of the axe and near parallel with each other. The axe fragment has been bent and distorted in antiquity, probably through hammering and bending to break the axe up. The mouth corner has been bent slightly inwards, making the internal angle around 70 degrees, rather than the expected 90 degrees. On the non-loop side of the mouth, there is bending near the break, giving the mouth and collar a concave outer surface. Near the break across the face, there is also distortion of the wall profile, giving the external face a concave profile and this was probably created through hammer impact. On the loop-side of the face there is a flattened impact facet, which has partly obscured one of the decorative ribs, although it is not certain as to whether this was damage caused in antiquity or during the recent retrieval of the axe from the ground. The axe fragment has a dark grey-green patina, with mouth top and break-edges showing areas of light-green and powdery surfaces. On the non-loop side, the collar break-edge shows a small area of unstable cracking within an area of light green and powdery corrosion deposit. 




Ribbed socketed axe fragment, probable South Wales type



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 76.0mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 34.2mm; thickness of mouth 5.6-6.7mm; dimensions runner stub - face 8.5 by 5.0mm; height 0.1mm; surviving weight 43.1g. 



This is an upper face, partial mouth and side fragment on the non-loop side of a ribbed bronze socketed axe. The axe has a narrow, well-defined collar, which in profile is straight and vertical rather than everted. The mouth was once near flat-topped, but has become distorted and slightly angled by later damage. The traces of two runner stubs may be detected, a complete one near the centre of a face side and a very small remnant stub trace on the non-loop side, just evident as a remaining slight protuberance on the mouth surface near the break. The external and internal plan of the mouth of the axe was once sub-rectangular with rounded corners. Two well defined decorative ribs may be seen on this small axe fragment descending from the collar down the upper face of the axe. The diagonal break across the face has removed all but the upper short section of the central rib, however the surviving side rib is straight, suggesting these two ribs were straight and parallel. The axe fragment has been bent and distorted in antiquity, probably through hammering while heated, to break the axe up. In plan, the mouth corner angle is around 120 degrees, rather than the expected 90 degrees and there is also a hammer impact mark on the collar, causing the mouth top to invert and distort. Along the diagonal face break, there is outward bending of the axe wall along the break margin and it is likely that the axe side has been distorted, as evidenced by a concave and splaying side-profile. On the interior wall surface, on the lower face, there is a localised tear in the metal, extending 5mm up the face. The break surfaces are markedly irregular, their patination indicating the axe was broken in antiquity. The axe surfaces have a dark grey-green patination. There are small localised areas of light-green and powdery corrosion products along breaks. At the tapering lower face and side tip of the fragment, there is an area of visible and unstable cracking within an area of light green and powdery corrosion deposit.




Plain socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 49.1mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 28.5mm; maximum surviving width at lower loop insertion 37.2mm; thickness of mouth 5.1-7.1mm; width of lower loop 5.0mm; surviving weight 39.2g. 



This is an upper face, side and partial mouth fragment of a plain bronze socketed axe. The axe has a narrow everted mouth moulding, defined on its lower margin by a wide concave shaped and inset moulding. A lower loop-stub is present on the axe side, indicating a narrow loop, the break having removed the upper stub. The mouth was once near flat-topped, but has become distorted through later damage. There are no runner-stubs or scars evident on this partial mouth fragment. The external and internal plan of the mouth of the axe was once sub-rectangular with rounded corners. The face of the axe is plain. Part of the casting seam down the upper loop side survives, indicating the seam was hammered or filed down as the axe was prepared for use. The axe fragment has been bent and distorted in antiquity, probably through hammering and bending to break the axe up. In plan, the mouth corner is around 120 degrees rather than the 90 degrees expected, while near the break on the non-loop mouth, the mouth top has been distorted inwards, possibly through a hammer blow. On the lower face side, there is pronounced denting of the axe surface, giving a marked concavity in the face surface. A localised point of impact with a blunt ended tool with a round head may be observed, while the even patination indicates this occurred in antiquity. The break surfaces are markedly irregular in places. The axe fragment has a dark grey-green patination. Around the mouth top and along break-edges there are areas of light-green and powdery corrosion deposits.




Cast copper-alloy pot or cauldron leg fragment



Dimensions: Maximum width 38.2mm; maximum surviving length 31.5mm; maximum surviving length of inner faceted 17.3mm; surface maximum thickness 20.5mm; surviving weight 70.1g. 



This is a wedge-shaped and tapering bronze artefact fragment, with one flat side, one convex faceted side and two break surfaces, one upper and one lower. The upper part of this object is both widest and thickest, the object tapering and thinning towards it foot. The front face is shaped flat, while the reverse has a narrow flattened top with a side facet on each side, giving a raised angular convex profile. The break along the upper surface has a diagonal downward angle, making the inner faceted face markedly narrower than the front and flat face. The surfaces are all heavily worn and corroded with a light-green and powdery patina, to the extent that the facets on the reverse surface are now poorly defined. The lower break is irregular while the upper break is particularly uneven and corroded, indicating the breaks occurred in antiquity. In one small area along the lower break, there is an area of exposed bronze metal, which has been recently scraped or filed.","References

The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There is damage to both edges of the blade.



It measures 37.2 mm in length, 12.5 mm wide (base), 7.2 mm wide (tip) and 6.6 mm thick. It weighs 7.7 g.



The spear head is a mid green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. This object has lost most of it's diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult. However similar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including SWYOR-1F74C1, SF-C557DC and WMID-270D2F.

965669,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Descriptions 




Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham faceted axe (Class D) - socket mouth and loop fragment



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 44.6mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 34.5mm; depth of collar to upper moulding margin 17.6mm; width of loop 5.3-5.5mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 20.9g. 



This is a partial mouth, upper face and loop-side fragment of a bronze slender socketed axe. The axe has a deep and trumpet shaped collar, whose lower margins are defined by three horizontal grooves, with a combined maximum width of approximately 4mm. The mouth top is flat, but the original shape of the mouth in plan is now unknown, due to distortion and bending of the fragment. The loop is slender and its upper arm descends from within the lower collar zone. The upper surviving face-edge on the loop-side has been emphasised by a vertical rib descending from the grooved collar lower margin. A facet is also visible on the upper face, running in near parallel with the ribbed face-edge, the facet edge also descending from the grooved collar margin. The axe fragment has been severely bent out of shape in the upper collar area, possibly in antiquity and prior to the burial of the artefact. The artefact has a brown patina and the break-edges look to be ancient. The axe fragment has suffered a modern glancing scrape along the upstanding and ribbed face-edge and on the collar, revealing areas of green patina and surface shine, where the original surfaces have been damaged. It is likely that this surface damage occurred during the recent discovery and retrieval of the socketed axe by the finder, or by through impact with agricultural machinery, when the axe was disturbed and dispersed from its original burial context.




Small ribbed socketed axe (undiagnostic to type) - blade fragment



Dimensions: maximum surviving length 27.4mm; width at upper break 36.6mm; blade width 42.8mm; max. surviving depth of socket approx. 11mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 40.6g. 



This is a blade-end fragment of a small bronze socketed axe, with just the base of the socket present and surviving. Near the blade, the sides flare out with concave curves to provide a modestly expanded blade edge. The ends of ribbed decoration is evident on both faces, four ribs present on one face, and one, possibly two ribs surviving on the opposite face. The ribs extend far down the face of the axe, their ends being between 12-18mm from the blade edge. Prominent casting seams are evident down each side, however appear to have been rapidly hammered down. Striations parallel with the blade edge suggest it was prepared for use after casting. The socket mould part was misaligned during casting, resulting in an extremely thin face wall on one side (0.7mm thick) and a thickened wall on the other (3.8-4.3mm thick). The axe fragment has a brown surface patina. There are localised patches near the blade edge where original surfaces have not survived and these have a green patina.



Identification & Discussion 



One of the artefact fragments (Cat. 1, above) may be identified as a Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham or Class D slender faceted axe. The deep and trumpet shaped collar, slender form and facet on the surviving upper face are all diagnostic of Class D / Type Meldreth axes, while the lower horizontal grooved moulding typifies the Type Aylsham Variant (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 204-7; Needham 1990, 41-3; Gwilt et al 2005, 37-8). Type Meldreth axes are generally regarded as of British type, although they do occur in Ireland and France (O' Connor 1980, 166-7; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 53-62, Cats. 296-392). Nearly all of the known hoard associations containing these axes are securely of Late Bronze Age date and belonging to the Ewart Park phase between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61), although a few examples have been found in slightly earlier Late Bronze Age hoards dating to 1150-1000 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 210-1; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61). In Wales, approaching 40 examples of slender faceted axes of Meldreth or Class D type are now known, being most common across south-east Wales (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 278 & 282; Gwilt 2004; Northover unpublished, 257-8, 267-9 & Cats. 583-610). Examples of these axes have been found in recently reported hoards from Rossett Community (Wrexham), Llanfrynach Community (Powys), Grosmont Community (Monmouthshire) and Llanharan Community (Rhondda Cynon Taf), all belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt et al 2005; 2016; 2018; Knight et al 2017).



The second socketed axe blade fragment (Cat. 2, above) belonged to a small ribbed socketed axe, however this blade end fragment is not diagnostic to precise type. Various forms of ribbed axes are common components of hoards from south-east Wales and belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). For example, ribbed axes of South Wales Type and their Variant forms are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over 40 hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. In addition, ribbed socketed axes, variously known as Southern English/Welby Type ribbed axes, Yorkshire Type axes, Croxton Type axes, Breiddin Type axes and Llanarth Type axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in around a dozen known hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales (e.g. Storrie 1887; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273, 280, 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1.1, 1.3, 1.10; Gwilt & Lodwick 2005; 2006; 2013; Lodwick & Gwilt 2007; Gwilt 2008; Northover unpublished, Hoards 74, 79, 85, 124). Therefore, this presence is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard association from this region.



The two reported artefacts were discovered approximately 80m apart and within the same field. Given their contemporary Late Bronze Age date, probably within the Ewart Park phase and dating to 1000-800 BC, it is probable that these two artefacts were once part of a directly associated hoard group and buried in the ground at the same time. It is probable that the ancient hoard group was disturbed and dispersed during recent agricultural activity, such as ploughing, harrowing or during earth movement events in the field.



A preliminary search of the Heritage Environment Record (HER) for the area (via www.archwilio.org.uk) revealed no Bronze Age features or sites in the adjacent fields. Some prehistoric activity is known to the east on Mynydd Llangors and Cefn Moel, in the form of hut settlements, a putative burnt mound and burial chamber and occasional flint tool finds. It is potentially significant that the landscape location selected for the deposition of this small hoard was in the vicinity of Cwm Nantyfelin stream. This watercourse has its origins in multiple springs draining off the slopes of Cefn Moel, located 1-2km to the east-north-east. It flows westwards and converges with Afon Llynfi, 0.5-1km to the west, before draining into Llangors Lake to the north. This specific watery landscape locality is likely to have been deliberately selected for the deposition of the hoard as a gift to the gods (Gwilt 2004, 121; Gwilt et al 2013, 11). This pattern is repeated with the siting of a number of Late Bronze Age hoards across south-east Wales, adding strength to this observation.","References

965677,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1800,-1500,"A copper alloy long flanged axehead /developed flat axe.



This axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, but not recurving. Cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a very shallow lenticular side profile. The flanges are slightly triple-faceted, so are slightly angled inwards on both face.



The axe has a very low ridge about two thirds of the way along the septum (c.45 mm from the butt), which may indicate the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion, . The blade is18.66 mm deep and has an even crescentic cutting edge,.

The surface is slightly pitted in some areas, but otherwise quite smooth and an even dark green-brown



Date: Early Bronze Age to Middle Bronze Age - c. 1800 - 1500 BC



Peter Reavill suggests that the axe dates to an Aylesford or Arreton metal working phase with a date in the final early Bronze age (EBA III) or the first part of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I).

The palstave is in good condition, with the copper alloy surface faded to a dark brown-ish orange with small patches of green patinisation and even smaller patches where the original shiny golden colour of the copper alloy persists. This survival, even to a small extent, is probably due to its deposition in a semi-waterlogged context. The butt is broad and the septum is relatively thick at 9.7mm. On either side of the septem the outer edges gradually rise upwards, creating a symmetrical curve on each side when viewed from above. The single loop, which is flattened in cross section. extends for 21mm on the upper surface, and there is a suggestion of a decorative cast line directly above this, extending along the side of the septum on this surface only. These broad edges narrow to the stop, which is rectilinear and measures 36.4 x 24.9mm. The blade extends in a linear fashion, only very gradually widening to the flared cutting edge. There is a central midrib on both sides of the blade, and it is further decorated with three deliberately incised grooves on the lower surface. The flared cutting edge remains relatively sharp, and measures 45.3mm in width and is 1.7mm thick at the cutting edge.



Matt Knight has commented on a similar example: ""Palstaves of this type are typically found across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, as well as further eastwards in Dorset and Wiltshire. Pearce (1983: 450 no. 279b, see also Plate 34) presents a very similar example from North Bovey. DEV-01DDC5 is a not dissimilar example from further east in the county.

The blade, cutting edge and part of the body survive. The blade is a shallow crescent slightly flared from the body, the socket is rectangular, and the body walls are thin cast (1.8 mm). The side view shows a wedge-shaped profile with a casting seam. There is a blunt projecting spur on one side 55 mm from the blade; this could be an abraded stump of a loop or casting flash.

The first two finds were c.30cm below the surface and the soil around them dark in colour. Archaeological advice has been sought.



1) The copper alloy arm-ring has lost all of its original surface patina. It currently measures max.79.5mm in diameter (internal 54.6mm) and weighs 99.08g. It has an apparently circular cross-section.



2) The copper alloy socketed hammer is missing most of its socket but retains the blade. The socket has a circular cross-section (26.5mm diameter), the walls of which are 4.5mm wide, and the solid blade below has a rectangular cross-section, 23.5x23.3mm below the socket and thinning to 23.5x14.7mm at the hammering end. It is missing all of its original patina. The incomplete object measures 83.4mm in length and weighs 162g (to the nearest 2g). The finder reports this object was lying flat to one face when found.



3) The piece of metalworking debris is apparently copper alloy but is rather light (13.89g) with several popped air bubbles visible on the surface. The surface is otherwise quite lumpy. It measures 25.9x19.2x(max.)16.1mm.



Discussion

Given the close proximity of the first two finds, it is highly likely these are part of an undisturbed hoard and date to the 'Ornament Horizon' of the Taunton metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1400-1250 BC). A larger hoard from Hampshire (2017 T160 / SUR-590F5D) features three Liss type arm-rings (with herringbone decoration) alongside several other ornaments, a palstave axehead and a socketed hammer.

966940,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Incomplete cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, ovate in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve and has a broken edge on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.



See CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 & 283.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC).

The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.0 mm (thickness: 2.4 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). 



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



It measures 72.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.4 mm, width at the butt is 12.0 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 48.6 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC.

The butt end is corroded and rounded in shape with peripheral damage, it is also thinner in thickness, suggesting that this may have been done deliberately to accommodate the hilt. The blade is very slightly concave in cross section. Part of the original surface survives on one face, and it is possible to make out a regular pattern of stamped dot decoration. This would appear to have originally covered the whole side in a series of triangles, made up of lines of dot decoration coming in from one edge, the areas in between are undecorated and because of that form a series of blank triangular shapes coming in from the opposite edge to complement the decorated ones. The other side in much more heavily pitting with little of the original surface remaining, but it is still possible to discern some stamped dot decoration.

969784,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-650,"An incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axe head dating from the Late Bronze age.



The axe head's socket, and an undeterminable amount of its face have been lost to an old break. The break is such that one side of the face is up to 18.1mm longer than the other. The lower half of the object and the blade survive more intact, however it is clear that the axe once had a thick brown patina which has only remained on a minority of the object. As this has worn away we are unable to see the axe's original surface, and as such, some diagnostic elements are difficult to make a decisive judgement about. The patina which has survived has probably done so due to being sat in water, with the patinaed parts sat in soil in the bed of the body of water.



The axe's body is sub-triangular in profile and sub-rectangular in plan, its sides expanding only very slightly, being almost straight, down the length of the axe from its socket towards the blade. Longitudinal linear casting seams are visible on both of the narrow sides of the axe head running from the socket of the axe down towards the blade, however it is difficult to see how far down these lines run due to the level of preservation. There is no surviving evidence for an attachment loop on the object. No decoration survives on the object, and it is likely that the axe's face has always been plain.



The hollow socket in the axe which remains is rectangular in plan which implies that the original socket was also this shape.



The blade edge is curved in profile and does not flare out at the blade corners. There is no evidence of sharpening on the blade, however, as the surviving surface is not the originals surface, this does not tell us whether this is the case. There are also no clear chips from use.



The surface is oxidized to a variety of colours ranging from dark brown to green in colour. The hollow interior of the object is devoid of any matter.



The axehead is 78.2mm long along its longest edge, 40.9mm wide at the blade, which then thins to c.35.9mm closer to the socket. The socket measures to 28.8mm long and 20.8mm wide. The metal is 4.9mm where the patina remains, and 2.5mm where it has been lost. The blade edge is c.4.7mm thick. The axe head weighs 107.64



grams.



The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).

971661,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Incomplete cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, sub-triangular in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade expand slightly and meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 27 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 76 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.



See CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 & 283.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

The break between the two pieces is probably recent and reveals a slightly purple crystalline matrix with many air bubbles. The edges of the breaks are not abraded but crisp. The butt is a slender trapezoidal with two rivet holes across the lower edge. There is a copper alloy rivet within each rivet hole. From these rivet holes the sides of the rapier expand into the shoulders of the blade. The maximum width of these shoulders is 31.03mm. From the shoulders the edge of the rapier narrows into the blade. From this point the blade itself tapers in width more gradually to almost have straight edges towards a broken edge. This break also feels fresh with crisp edges.  The blade is an elongated lozenge in cross-section with no clearly defined mid-rib or edge bevels.



The object has a matte mid-dark green-brown patina.



The length of the rapier measures 82.58mm, 31.03mm wide, 13.05mm thick at the rivets, 4.81mm thick at the blade break and together they weigh 35.3g. its maximum thickness is 6.8mm.

Metal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip (undertaken at the British Museum) indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94% gold and 6-8% silver, the rest (less than 1%) being copper. (See appended report).



Curators note: this is a very similar composition to the very similar band from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).



Discussion: Of Early Bronze Age date (c.2500 - 1500 BC), and now in two pieces, this is only the fifth or sixth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chacolithic period, c. 2500-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.



The function or what object this mount decorated is not certain; suggestions include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps a decorative strip attached to leather. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham & Sheridan 2014, 908-9).

Both faces of the object retain traces of decoration in the form of numerous longitudinally-arranged raised ridges of rectangular section, parallel to each other. It isn't possible to determine what the reverse of the sheet-gold looks like.

To one edge of the object the sheet is unbroken/ undamaged on the rounded part, while the other edge is damaged. The narrower part above has jagged edges that are not joined.

The rounded end has a max.width of 10.4mm and a max.thickness of 2.1mm. The narrower strip above is max.6.8mm wide, narrowing to 4.8mm at the open end (both faces of the object are folded over at the very end). The piercing visible in one face only is 0.8mm in diameter and pierced from front to the reverse. It is possible there may be a matching piercing on the other face of the object and that this is now concealed by the fold.

The object measures 14.9mm in length, 10.4mm in max.width, 2.9mm in max.thickness (at the jagged edges of the narrower section) and weighs 0.76g.

973773,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy, Middle to Late Bronze Age (1500-800 BC) Socketed Spearhead.



Description: The spearhead is narrow and triangular with a pronounced mid rib on both sides extending to the tip of the spear which tapers into a blunt point. In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib, with multiple abrasions and missing portions along the edges. The fragment terminates in an old abraded, irregular transverse break, across the socket. The metal is pitted and corroded.



Measurements: length:43.87mm, width: 10.66mm, thickness: 7.48mm, weight.18g.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1500-c. 800 cal BC).

973831,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"An almost complete copper alloy unlooped palstave of Middle Bronze Age date (c. 1500-1300 BC) with shield shaped hollow below the stop ridge. Early or primary palstave of Group I - shield patterned type.



The palstave has a triangular shaped blade in plan. The palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 28.7 mm in width and 8.1 mm thick.



Beneath the stop-ridge descends a shield shaped hollow, this is visible but worn on both faces.



The blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical and shows wear. The cutting edge measures 64.7 mm in width and is 9.6 mm thick.



The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of most of the original surface.



This form and style of palstave fits can be classified as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC specifically within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. A close comparison to this palstave has been recorded from the Albrighton Area, Shropshire (HESH-D05FE3) and (WMID-755304) discovered in the Staffordshire Moorlands. Schmidt and Burgess (1981) have parallels for this type on plate 57.



Peter Reavill adds that the Palstave is heavier than normal, it was in this period that the makers were experimenting with adding more lead in to the composition. This was because by adding more lead it helped fill all corners of the mould.



Overall the palstave measures 152 mm in length, a maximum width of 64.7 mm at the cutting edge, and a maximum thickness near the stop ridge of 28.8 mm. It weighs 468.7 g.

974926,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1700,"Part of an undecorated flat axe of Early Bronze Age date (about 2200 - 1700 BC). Only the cutting blade end survives, probably less than half of the whole axehead. The axehead is 58mm long, 68.2mm wide tapering to 48.4mm, 11mm thick and weighs 216g.



The axe probably best fits within the Migdale metalworking tradition Type: Migdale - undecorated variant. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II - VI), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2200 - 1700 CAL. BC.



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with evenly expanding sides that extend to a splayed crescent shaped blade. The butt end is broken. In profile the axe is broadly lentoid with the blade end tapering. In cross section the axe is rectangular with all four faces only very slightly convex.



The sides of the axe gently expand evenly in width to a point just above the cutting edge where they become distinctly out-turned / splayed. The long edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge) on either face of the axe. The tips of the blade are in good condition and there are indistinct blade facets on both faces of the cutting edge.



The axe has large patches of light green patina surviving, but is a red colour where the patina is missing. The surface is smooth and solid. Although there has been some surface loss there is no evidence of applied incised or hammered decoration. The break is patinated and irregular.

The palstave is near-complete, missing the loop but is heavily-corroded and is comparatively small (with a length of 108.6mm and a weight of 194.6g). The butt is straight, now worn to a slight angle (with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 5mm). The sides are near parallel, very gently convex (reaching a width of 23.5mm above the loop and a width of 20.8mm at the stop). The loop has been lost but the stubs indicate that it was positioned either side of the stop (with a length of 25mm and internal length of 9mm). The sides of the blade are gently curved and divergent, producing a moderately expanded blade edge with prominent curve (with a blade width of 37.4mm). The casting seams are raised and discernible on both sides but were neatly finished. The sides are appear to have been flat across the depths above the stop but convex on the blade. The flanges have been truncated but the better preserved flange appears to have been straight, gradually rising from the butt to the stop (with a maximum surviving thickness at the stop of 24.0mm. The stop has a gentle curve and near-vertical sides, perpendicular to the septum. The septum is moderately concave across its width and flat across its length. Both faces are ribbed, with a prominent midrib, flanked on each side with weaker ribs, positioned near but not at the sides. The ribs appear to have extended all the way along the blade to a blade facet. A single blade facet is evident on the blade. The surface is corroded but has mid to dark-green patina where it survives.



The palstave has a number of unusual features; Type Roundhay palstaves are generally smaller but this example is unusually small and also the three-rib decoration arrangement is difficult to parallel. The form is broadly consistent with Transitional Palstaves and specifically of Type Roundhay.

Discussion: A gold-plated lock ring of a similar style on the database (LANCUM-C2543F) that is Bronze Age in date was submitted for consideration as treasure (Treasure case tracking number: 2017T810) and includes the discussion: ‘This penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997).



However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple 'hair-rings' of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, 'hair-rings' have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal BC and 1373-1019 cal BC respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).



'Hair-rings' are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O'Connor et al 2008; DCMS 2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (Eluère 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O'Connor et al 2008). There are a number of examples known from Wales, Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, 'Carmarthenshire', Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 & 15).



LANCUM-C2543F is the first complete example from Cumbria and the only other complete example known from the North West is from Wrenbury practically on the Welsh border. There is another broken example from West Cumbria manufactured from gold sheet rolled into a tube with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 80-82%, silver content of 14-15%, with at least 4% copper. The ring is formed from gold sheet rolled into a curved tube, with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. According to Gillian Varndell Curator, Department of Prehistory and Europe, British Museum. It is probably part of a well-known Bronze Age ornament type (composite ring) dating to c.1300-1100 BC. This find is also close to other gold finds from West Cumbria from a similar period consisting of a penannular bracelet and three lock rings. These finds are very significant for the North West in terms of high status Late Bronze Age activity.



The complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 & Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.","As the object is over 300 years old and contains more than 10% precious metal, it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act.

The copper alloy spearhead consists of the upper portion of the spear, being broken above the socket. The tip is also damaged and abraded. In plan the spearhead is an elongated sub-triangle with the blade facets and tip all being abraded. The spear blades cutting edges have therefore been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The spearhead has a bi-convex shaped cross section.

The palstave has a straight sided blade with the sides almost parallel and very little expansion towards the cutting edge which is 29 mm in width, with one corner of edge missing. There is a wide central rib on each face of the blade that is about 47 mm in length on both sides and 11 mm in width, just below the stop ridge, and tapers to 9 mm towards the end of blade. The base of the stop ridge remains on both sides, creating a T-shape in profile, so that the depth of the broken edge is 30 mm. On one side of the palstave the base of the side-loop survives below stop ridge, but the loop and its upper attachment are missing with the rest of the hafting end of the palstave, which would have held the handle. The surface of the blade is damaged, corroded and pitted and the original edge is missing down one side of the blade.

The terminal at the opposite end also narrows to a point and is intentionally cut in a straight diagonal on one edge. This terminal is also folded back on itself. As the object presents now both terminals bend in the same direction, but without the transverse bend of the object they would bend in opposite directions.

At the centre of the object it measures max.7.4mm wide. This narrows to 2.6mm and 2.7mm at the terminal folds. The object has a length of 18.5mm and weighs 0.51g. Its estimated length without the transverse fold is c.28mm.","
