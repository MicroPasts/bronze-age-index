The object is the tip of a socketed spearhead, the blade is narrow and triangular with a pronounced mid rib on both sides extending to the tip of the spear which tapers in to a point. In cross section the object is lozenge shaped. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. There are multiple abrasions and missing portions of the edges. The fragment terminates in an old abraded transverse break. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing and the retained portions has a shallow concave aspect expose by the break.



The metal is a dark-green in colour with a pitted and corroded patina.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).

The palstave is missing its butt end which was hafted to the handle and likely broke at this point during use with the rest of the palstave still attached to the handle. The palstave has the remains of a rounded protruding stop ridge on both sides, 27 mm in total thickness, with recessed apertures within, 7 mm deep, which would have originally held the end of the haft or handle for the axehead. Below the stop ridge, which is 26 mm wide, the front and the back of the blade are recessed, 20 mm in thickness, and the sides are slightly inset and parallel to begin with, at 25 mm in width, but expand towards the cutting edge, 44 mm in width, to form a triangular-shaped blade in plan. The blade end is damaged and 9 mm in thickness, but there are no signs of it expanding to a crescentic edge. The surface of the blade is damaged and pitted but does not appear to have been decorated. The sides are also pitted and corroded but there is no evidence of the remains of the bottom of a side loop.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a slender palstave with no mouldings on the blade from the hoard of mainly shield-patterned palstaves found at St Tudy, Cornwall, on p.78, pl.5, no.78d.



Palstaves with shield-shaped decoration and expanded blades can be found during the Acton Park II metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) of the Middle Bronze, such as the palstave illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, p.128, fig.29, no.96).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar palstaves with low flanges, rounded stops and plain, triangular blades from the south of Scotland and Churwell, West Yorkshire in plate 61, nos.839 & 844, which are un-classified, but grouped with the South-western palstaves, and related to continental examples, respectively, but the latter is due to its decoration and not the form which is similar to this example.

983787,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1140,"Description: An incomplete cast copper-alloy rapier, in two intentionally broken sections, dating to the middle Bronze Age (c.1275-1140BC).



Both parts of the blade are broken at both ends; the breaks are abraded and old. One section blade tapers to a broken tip with broadly parallel edges. The other section is wider and bent at one end. Each has a tapered cutting edge on both sides. There is a flattened central rib on both faces the length of the blade, measuring approximately 9.81mm, giving a shallow lentoid cross section. Examination of the break sections, particularly the break at which the two sections join, show casting flaws in the form of hollows (or bubbles). 



The blade has a patchy green brown patina.



Dimensions: One section measures 128.35mm in length, is 17.70mm wide, 4.81mm thick and weighs 52.2g. The other is 101.45mm long, tapers from 17.37mm to 10.29mm in width, is 4.86mm thick and weighs 28.5g.



Discussion: The blade is comparable in some respects to Bronze Age blades, such as those described BERK-227481 and KENT-FE8716, but the central ridge on this find seems less prominent and the blade is thicker throughout. The bend and break shows similarities to rapier DOR-2A928E, which was also broken in antiquity prior to deposition. Following the blade cross-section scheme of classification set out by Burgess & Gerloff 1981 (in O'Connor et al. 1995, 347)  the blade under discussion here (2020-T354 / DUR-7A57CC) is a Group IV rapier, with slightly rounded cross-section characteristic of the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age ""with a floruit around the 13th/12th centuries cal BC (c.1275-1140BC)

984922,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A fragment of a gold penannular bracelet of Late Bronze Age date (1150-800 BC). The object is circular sectioned and slightly curved in plan with transverse cuts at both ends. One of the cuts in not clean and the object appears to have ben initially cut, with the remaining 50% of the bar being broken off. There are some minor shallow gouges in the surface of the object. 



Length: 58.42mm, Diameter: 5.02mm, Weight: 17.0g 



The original form would likely have been similar to LEIC-A3A9AE.



Several similar fragments of goldwork have been recovered from hoards containing diagnostically Bronze Age objects (e.g. Poulton, Gloucestershire: Treasure case 2004 T17 and the Fitzleroi Farm, West Sussex, hoard: BM accession nos. 1996, 0902.1-42). Those hoards, and several others recorded in recent years, contain fragments of gold that has been snipped with a pincer like instrument, similar to the Calbourne fragment. The shape of the terminal is relatively universal but can be compared to other round section bar bracelets of Bronze Age date (e.g, with 2011 T926 (CAM-08B4E0) cf. Taylor 1980. Furthermore, the composition of the gold does not disagree with a Later Bronze Age date.



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis shows a composition of 78.07% gold, 15.47% silver and 5.67% copper.",The object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old.

It has three holes on one of the broken sides, and several smaller ones on one of the convex sides, probably caused by escaping gas. There are other shallower holes on one of the convex sides, which may be the imprints of grit or small stone pebbles that the molten metal dropped onto.

986501,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1800,"A fragment of a copper alloy Flat Axe of Early Bronze Age date (2200-1800 BC). The object is a fragment of an uncertain type of Flat or Developed Axe form. The object is composed of the butt end which is broken toward the blade end by an old, abraded and irregular break. The retained butt end is abraded but is rectangular in plan and section and tapers out toward the body of the object both in plan and section.  The sides are straight and slightly divergent for their short lengths to the break. There is no indication of flanges retained within the fragment.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form, absence of flanges and the presumed bronze composition would be consistent with axes of Needham's type 3 and in relation to Schmidt and Burgess (1981) typology may have been of Migdale, Aylesford or allied types. Axes of these types are likely to be date to the Early Bronze Age, perhaps between c. 2200 - 1800BC.

986507,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy Socketed Spearhead, of Middle to Late Bronze Age date (1200-800 BC).



The blade is narrow and sub-triangular with a pronounced mid rib on both sides extending to both ends of the spear. In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. All of the edges are broken and abraded. The fragment terminates in an old abraded transverse break at both ends. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing.



The metal is dark green in colour with a slightly pitted patina.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).

987308,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"A complete, cast, socketed copper alloy hammer dating to the Late Bronze Age (1000-700 BC).



Description: The body of the hammer has been relatively crudely finished with the casting seems very prominent and unworn.  The socket is sub-square in cross-section at the mouth with a double moulding on the exterior. The main body of the hammer is narrow below the moulded collar and flares slightly to the working face. The face and body are as one unlike modern hammers so the bell/poll is from the socket to the working face. The face has a convex surface and is a rounded square in plan, with convex sides and smooth, rounded edges. The face is relatively smooth and its edges are marked by a range of numerous irregular and differently aligned indentations, some of which could be recent agricultural damage, but most of which are probably use wear.



The surface condition of the hammer is good, though there are several patches of surface loss where pale green corrosive products are visible. Otherwise the surface is patinated dark green.



Measurements:  55.16mm in length, 31.38mm wide, at the bell/poll; 29.75mm thick, and weight of 166.75g in weight.



Discussion: Socketed hammers are a rare find, especially when compared to socketed axeheads with, at the date of writing less than 60 examples reported to the PAS Database and only a small number of examples found in Kent;  KENT-FDBC44 and another in Crundale Hoard KENT-7C3863. The Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website comments that the ""socketed (hammers are) only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976: 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA' With regard to decoration, they are found with or without a single rib band, and in the case of a few hoards in Brittany, some hammers were found with chevron decoration."" Another example on the PAS database with decoration similar to this example is NMGW-475C27.



The YORYM-ABCCE1 record for another hammer discusses the dating of socketed hammers stating that 'early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding'. with this in mind this example appears to date to the Late Bronze Age.

Previously very few had been recorded, but metal detecting has increased the number slowly over the years, once they were thought to be of Early Bronze Age date as a straight evolution from the flint barbed and tanged arrowheads. Another theory was that these could have come from abroad but no parallel has been noted from the continent of this distinct form, though there are variations on the barbed and tanged type.

Description: The axehead has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle, with two concave faces flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade remains very narrow for the type and the flaring a crescentic cutting edge appears to have been worn down. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners . It has a raised double collar, the outer band of whcih is mostly worn or broken away, what remains is obscured by wear and corrosion as is the lower band. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have been worked down either through hammering or filing/polishing, particularly towards the blade end perhaps suggesting extensive sharpening of the blade, perhaps indicating why the blade is so short. Part of side of the axehead is broken away and the axe has some advanced corrosion particularly towards the butt end of one of the faces. It has a more even patination towards the blade edge.

Description: The fragment represents part of the blade end of the long rectangular socketed body of the axehead. No edge remains in tact so over all shape is based on known more complete examples. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips likely flared slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible . The axehead is patinated a mottled mid-light green and the breaks have led to more extensive corrosion and most surfaces are heavily pitted.

989237,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1550,450,"A fragment of copper alloy casting waste, probably a jet or mould, probably dating from the late Bronze Age but possibly dating from as late as the Roman period, c. 1500 BC to 450 AD.



The object is formed of a thick central bar which isbroadly rectilinear in plann, but which rises to an off centre ridge. At each end of the central bar, the object flares outwards creating two loosely triangular terminals. These are the result of two circular apertures, of different sizes, which give the impression of an overall hourglass shape. The larger of these is 35mm in width and the smaller is 25.4mm in width. The central bar narrows on the reverse, tapering from 13.7mm wide and ending as a slender rectilinear base of 7mm in width.The upper surface, while pitted and marked, is relatively regular, while on the reverse, there are depressions which hollow out a flaring rectilinear shape in the centre, and a further less regularly shaped semi triangular depression on the underside of the upper wide area. 



Casting waste is difficult to date in isolation but the patina and form are suggestive of a Bronze Age - Roman date.  The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting. The depressions are likely to have been caused by the product moulded cooling and contracting during casting (Reavill pers.comm). Like the first of the named examples below, it may have been from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould.

989779,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"An incomplete copper-alloy looped, socketed axehead dating from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age c. 800 - 700 BC. The mouth of the axe-head has a prominent collar and indicates a rectangular shape with rounded edges, however only half the mouth remains, in addition to the single loop. To the side of the loop runs a longitudinal ridge with a darker green fill; this appears to be a casting fault, and a possible attempt at fixing the break: though this appears to be an old mend, it has not been established whether or not this feature is the result of recent intervention. With the exception of the collar, the edges of the highly fragmentary axehead are worn and all demonstrate an even, green patina, suggesting the breaks are old. Worn ridges on the surface of the front of the axehead suggest there may originally have been one or several ribs running from the collar towards the (now missing) blade.

990381,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"A complete copper alloy flat axehead, probably dating from the Early Bronze Age period (c. BC 2350 - c. BC 2050). 

The axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid.

The sides of the axe gently taper outwards with a shallow curve, from the rounded butt to the blade. The curve is less shallow towards the blade. The axehead has suffered significant loss from corrosion on all surfaces, particularly at the blade and the butt.

The axehead measures 67.4 mm in length, the butt is 18.1 mm wide and the blade measures 27.3 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.8 mm, the ridge measures 10.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 59 g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

991249,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete strip of decorated gold, of probable Bronze Age dating (c. 1500 BC to c. 800 BC).



The strip of gold is sub rectangular in shape and has been folded into a sub triangular shape. The strip has been decorated with a series of embossed ridges along its length. One end has a relatively straight and smooth cut edge, the other end is hidden inside the folds. 



It measures 13.2 mm in length, 4.4. mm wide and 4.0 mm thick. It weighs 1.1 g.



Similar strips of gold with ribbed decoration have been recorded on the PASdatabase including WMID-fe3c28, ESS-C13B97, SUR-1B64F5, NMS-46A4D6, PAS-E9E2A1, SF-D30D10, LIN-946F12 and WAW-052196.



Similar multi-grooved strips of a Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48). A very similar strip from Sproxton, North Yorkshire is recorded on the PAS database as LVPL-83FE92. There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England. Other Bronze Age gold strips found singly such as at Flixton, Yorkshire (British Museum 2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16, no. 2) are broader and have more and narrower incised grooves. The annular ring from the Late Bronze Age hoard at Abia de la Obispalia, central Spain is comparable in form and dimensions but the grooves appear to have been incised rather than embossed (Almagro Gorbea 1974). Similarly, the Bronze Age annular ring from Armissan, southeast France may be comparable (Eluère 1981, 48-49, fig. 55).



As this fragment is older than 300 years in age, with a precious metal content of greater than 10%, it should be considered as potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.

991872,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-900,"An incomplete Middle to Late Bronze Age palstave axehead of Transitional or Late type, dating to the Penard or Wilburton phase (MBA III to LBA I; 1100 - 900 BC). Almost the entire butt end is missing (old break), making it difficult to determine its original length. It has the remains of one side loop (old break).

The long edges of the blade flare gently in a straight line, subtly expanding just above the curved cutting edge which has suffered some damage (now worn but leaving indents along the edge). The blade is 27.7mm wide just below the loop and increases to a width of 41.8mm at the cutting edge. Just above the loop is the stop ridge, deeper than it is wide (27.8mm wide x 33.7mm deep). From this and extending longitudinally at the centre of both faces, is a ridge-like moulding (rather than a defined mid-rib), which shallows-out towards the cutting edge.

The remains of the loop measure 10.6mm in length, 7.0mm in width and 8.2mm in thickness. It is oval in cross-section. Extending from the base of the loop to the cutting edge and slightly more towards one face than the other is the remains of a worn casting flash. This is also apparent to the opposite side of the axehead, again leaning slightly more to one face than the other.

The stop ridge is convex to front and back while its side edges are straight; in cross-section it forms an 'H'. The depth between ridge and face of the butt end is 10.8mm to one side and 12.8mm to the other. The flanges are of uneven thicknesses: with the loop facing left and looking at the stop ridge from above (in cross-section) the flange on the bottom right measures 5.9mm, the top right measures 4.5mm, the bottom left measures 5.1mm and the top left is missing. The remains of the face measures 9.7mm thick and c.6mm in length.

The incomplete palstave measures 98.0mm in length, 41.8mm in max.width, 33.7mm in max.thickness and weighs 304g (to the nearest 2g). Cf.

992034,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"A fragment of a socketed axe of the late Bronze Age, dating c.1100-800 BC. The fragment comprises the cutting edge, blade, blade tips and just the lower portion (approx 11 mm) of the body.



The cutting edge is crescent shaped, the blade flares out to the tips. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have not been worked down and remain fairly prominent, there is little sign of overall wear on the blade. The body is sub rectangular in section, as is the internal socket end. The whole object has a well formed, dark brown patina. Although it is difficult to determine from a fragment, the axehead  probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).

The axehead consists of part of the hollowed blade. It appears truncated, so that a portion of blade and socket are missing. The blade itself is markedly thicker on the upper surface (8.53mm) than the lower surface (2.50mm), but both share the same profile, flaring from the rectangular socket to form a wider cutting edge. There are some signs of unfinished seams on the side surfaces. It is now a greenish patina with a notable area of damage in different places on both sides- diagonally across the blade and at the lower edge of the blade and side piece. 



The axehead is slightly reminiscent but neater and better produced than no. 176 in Pearce (1983: 431), which she describes as being from the Ashburton area. WILT-A8FADF is a closer example.

993163,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Cast copper alloy fragment of a Late Bronze Age sword, sub-rectangular in plan and profile and 'flying saucer'-shaped (stepped lozenge) in section, from the Carp's Tongue complex, dating from c.1000-800 BC. The blade is incised on both faces with a pair of parallel longitudinal grooves, approximately 4.7mm in from the edge, at the junction of the oval-section midrib and the bevelled blade edges. The grooves taper as the blade edge does, towards the rounded broken edge, which is not the tip of the blade. The grooves border a central raised mid-rib which is 14 mm wide and 6 mm thick, measuring both faces of the blade together, but more pitted on one side. The wider broken end appears to have been deliberately  and cleanly cut perpendicular to the edge which is commonly seen in the breaking up of swords into fragments for deposition (Matt Knight pers comm).

Description: A group of four fragments of a range of objects, dating from the early to late Bronze Age (2350-800 BC).



1 Middle Bronze Age date (1500- 1100 BC).



2 Middle Bronze Age date from the period (1500- 1100 BC).



3 Early to Middle Bronze Age date from the period (2350-1500 BC). 



4 Mid to Late Bronze Age date (1600-800 BC).



1 An incomplete copper alloy Palstave The object is a slender palstave. The cutting edge has a crescentic form with slightly flared tips. The edge is missing portions of side due to post-depositional processes. There is a stopridge a little under halfway down the palstave. The stopridge is flush with the flange. The integral loop is centred just before the stopridge. There is a beak at the apex of the loop resulting in the loss of a small portion and the break is abraded. The flange ends at the stopridge resulting in a shield shape. Portions of the outer edges of both flange are missing due to post-depositional processes. The flanges and septum form an H shape. There is a slight central raised mid-rib, extending from the stopridge to the cutting end on both sides. The object retains casting seams around the upper and lower edges. The butt edge is irregular in plan. The metal has a dark greenish brown, slightly pitted patina.  



Late/transitional palstave possibly of the Wilburton/Penard Phase.



2 An incomplete copper alloy Palstave The object is a slender palstave. The cutting edge has a crescentic form with slightly flared tips. The edge is missing portions of side due to post-depositional processes. There is a stopridge a little under halfway down the palstave. The stopridge is flush with the flange. The integral loop is centred just before the stopridge. The flange ends at the stopridge resulting in a shield shape. Portions of the outer edges of both flange are missing due to post-depositional processes. The flanges and septum form a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges. There is a pronounced central raised mid-rib, extending from the stopridge to the cutting end on both sides, which expands and becomes more shallow towards the cutting edge. There is a semi-circular void in the centre of the butt end. The object retains casting seams around the upper and lower edges. The metal has a dark green, slightly pitted patina. 



Late/transitional palstave possibly of the Wilburton/Penard Phase.



3 A fragment of a copper alloy Flat Axehead. The retained portion is the cutting edge of a flat axehead, it is solid cast and the object flares out to the sides towards the butt end creating a wedge shape. The sides of the cutting edge are flared and the cutting edge tapers in to form a bevelled cutting edge. There is a casting seam visible on the upper and lower edges. The object terminates in a transverse break resulting in the loss of approximately 60% of the original form.  



4 A fragment of a copper alloy Blade, Dagger or Rapier. The object is rectangular in plan and ovate in cross section. It is incomplete being broken transversely on the upper and lower edges. There is visible bevelling along the left and right hand edges away from the mid-ribs. The central portion of the blade retains two longitudinal mid-ribs. The metal a dark green predominantly smooth patina.



Discussion: It is not possible to assign the more fragmentary pieces (no’s 3-4) to a particular typological grouping due to their fragmentary nature, however they fit within similar groups of middle to late Bronze Age hoards using those diagnostic features which are retained. The more complete objects (1-2) fit within the Wilburton/Penard Phase of Late/transitional middle Bronze Age date.

The blade extends either side of the midrib terminating in abraded edges. The inner portion of the spear head is hollow, in which a wooden shaft would have been fitted. Although insufficient remains to have complete confidence in classifying this object, as the midrib extends to the tip, it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 5-11, while its section is possibly most indicative of the Late Bronze Age pegged types, Davis Group 11.



The metal has a mid-green patina and is worn. The spear head is 46.4mm long, 27.3mm wide, 9.2mm thick and weighs 16.1g.

994726,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A copper alloy Middle Bronze Age side looped and socketed spearhead dating to the period c. 1600 - 1150 BC. The blade is leaf-shaped with a lozengiform sectioned midrib. It exhibits a hollow socket and cast side loops. It is complete apart from a small amount of damage to the base of the socket. The spearhead measures 126.9mm in length, 21.6mm maximum width, 9.3mm minimum thick on the blade, 18.3mm in diameter at the base of the socket and weighs 53.54g.



The tip of the blade has a slightly break to one side and the edges of the blade are chipped along their length. The sides widen towards the base but are straight or only very slightly convex. At the base is the widest point then a distinct carination then they angle downwards  into the socket. There seems to be some evidence of a sharpened blade edge but not clear bevel and this is mostly lost to chipping.  The blade measures 62.7mm in length,21.6mm maximum width. The edge of the blade is 0.9mm thick, tapering to a maximum thickness of 2.8mm by the midrib. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering lozenge shaped midrib which expands from a thickness of 2.7mm at the tip to 9.3mm at the base of the head.



The socket is oval in cross section at the top wider in line with the midrib, narrower in plane with the blade) 10.9mm by 9.3mm. It becomes circular in shape by the base where it measures 18.7mm in diameter. The mouth of the socket  has an old break to one side. The socket is at least 24.8mm deep but contains dry, copper stained material so was originally deeper. This is dust with no fibrous properties remaining but could be the remains of the wooden haft, or of later mud.



The loops are positioned on either side of the socket, about half way down, approximately opposite one another. The loops are curved, more elongated than a semi-circle and have slightly widened outer edges into slight loop plates . The loops measure 11mm in length, 3.5-4mm in width at the base, 4-4.5, at the centre and project 4.5-4.7mmmm from the outside of the socket. The holes are now filled with corrosion. Casting ribs are visible running along both sides of the body from the mouth to the point at which the blade commences.



The spearhead has a mottled dark green patina and the surface is heavily pitted.

The fragment is rectangular in plan and triangular, or wedge shaped, in section. The outer edge of the blade fragment flattens to a sharp edge, whilst the inner edge widens to a broken edge. Both the top and bottom of the blade fragment are broken. It seems likely this is a fragment of a triangular blade possibly from a spear head which would widen to a central prominent rib.

The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. A small lip runs around the edge of the socket and there is a collar of similar width around the narrowest part of the axe. The axe is otherwise undecorated. Both sides of the axe have a pronounced casting seam running along their centre. There is a loop on one side of the axe, joining next to the collar and extending to about halfway along the blade.

2.    Complete cast copper alloy socketed axe head. The axe is relatively long. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It has a subrectangular body, narrowest in the middle, flaring wider towards the socket and widest at the cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. There is a double raised collar at the socket end. The axe is otherwise undecorated. Both sides of the axe have a pronounced casting seam running along their centre. There is a  loop on one side of the axe, joining next to the collar and extending about a quarter of the way along the blade.

Discussion: 1. Is Type Portree (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, esp nos. 1043 and 1051). 2. Is a socketed axe of Type Wilburton (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos. 1007-1009). They both date from the earlier Late Bronze Age, c. 1125-900BC. The two axes are contemporary, which fits with them having been deliberately deposited together as a hoard. A similar combination of types can be seen in the hoard from Lowthorpe ER Yorkshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 139E).

995858,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1000,800,"an incomplete copper alloy late Bronze Age socketed arrowhead or small spearhead, dated to the late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 800 BC).



A cast bronze arrowhead, possibly dating to the late Bronze Age between c. 1000-800 BC (length: 48.48mm; width: 9.14mm; thickness: 8.4mm; diameter of socket: 4.76mm; weight: 9.8g). The arrowhead flares out gently from the base and narrows towards the tip forming a ""leaf-shape"" when viewed in plan.  On both the face and reverse, a central rib extends from the base towards the tip, although its presence is uncertain at the tip due to material loss. The metal narrows to form lateral blades either side of the central rib, although the edges of the blades are missing, making the original shape uncertain. The tip is missing, leaving a rough, rounded end to the object.  The base includes a circular blind socket which extends about 15mm into the object. The arrowhead appears to be solid. 



The metal surface is mostly dark green with some small raised patches of mid-brown material which are likely to be soil or a corrosion product or a coating.  A large proportion of the surface is smooth, appearing to be original, but approximately 20% of this surface has been lost to corrosion or physical damage, leaving a rough surface.  The base is broken through the socket so it is likely that part of the length is missing. The break surface is rough and has a similar green surface patina to the rest of the object. The break reveals the roughness of the casting, with two sub-spherical cavities in the region of the junction of the blades with the material surrounding the socket, which are probably bubbles from casting process.

 



WMID-28FC66 describes a similar object and states that ""Bronze arrowheads dating to this period are extremely rare in Britain, with one found as part of a hoard in Penard, Wales (Savory, 1980, 57) as well as possible arrowheads found on the Isle of Portland, Sussex, Yorkshire, Montgomeryshire and another on display in Norwich Museum. Bronze arrowheads seem to appear more regularly in France where they were first manufactured in the Middle Bronze Age, in the Paris basin and the west-central area (Savory, 57).""



Similar objects are described in SUSS-5DC319, SWYOR-19E2B1, SWYOR-C57356 and WMID-3AE711.  These appear to mostly date to the late Bronze Age.  Although arrowheads are described as very rare finds, this example does appear to be very small for a spearhead.  Although the edges, base and tip are missing and therefore original size cannot be determined, the shape appears to taper inward towards the base and so it is unlikely that the socket diameter is much bigger than the 4.76mm measured.  This indicates that the shaft of the original weapon would be narrow and relatively weak for a spear, unless made for a child or ceremonial purpose.","This object was partly recorded during the Covid19 crisis.

997089,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Incomplete cast copper alloy flat axehead dating from the Migdale tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC. The sides of the axehead look slightly raised on both faces but that is because the original surface, which has turned dark brown in colour, has only survived around the edges making it look crisper, and also on the blade above the slightly expanded but worn and rounded cutting edge. The axehead is sub-trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the butt end. The blade narrows towards the damaged butt end, but with almost straight sides. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now very pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away. 



Similar slender flat axeheads with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

997810,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy single looped palstave axe with high, protruding stopridge and incomplete preserved side loop, dating to the Mid Bronze Age (1300 to 1150BC), possibly relating to the Silsden types generally dated to the Penard. The axe is complete, except for the arch of the side loop. The body of the palstave is narrow but splays down the blade eventually flaring at the blade edge which is wide. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which may well have been hammered. The butt is squared, tapering with narrow flanges on both sides. The side loop is adjacent to the stop ridge and incomplete. Both sides of the blades are heavily pitted and scratched. There is green patina and iron-corrosion across the whole of the axe.



The palstave axe measures 132mm in length. The blade is 48.5mm wide and 2.5mm thick at the cutting edge and the butt 21.0mm wide and 14.0mm thick at the stop.The axe weighs 234 grams.



Similar to LANCUM-050851, the two Type Silsden side-looped palstaves can be dated to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 161). They are classified within the broader 'Late Palstave' type but are typologically close to 'Transitional Palstaves' such as Type Shelf (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160).

1000300,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-800,"A complete copper-alloy awl of probable Late Bronze Age date (c.1150-800 cal BC).



The awl's body is square in cross section (5.1x4.9mm). One end narrows relatively quickly (over c.10.1mm.) to a soft point that is tall (1.9mm) and thin (0.7mm). The opposite end narrows over a far longer distance (over c.20.4mm). This length of thw awl is bent slightly downwards and ends in a soft (square sectioned) point.



The awl is a medium green colour and slightly abraded.



The awl is 53.8mm long, 5.1mm wide and 4.9mm thick. It weighs 5.40 grams



Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin.  Plain awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).

The blade, although missing its tip, is lanceolate in shape (being broadly triangular in plan). There is a pronounced central spine on both faces which is triangular in form having a wide base at the tang that narrows to the tip of the spear. To either side of the spine is a low rib that is flanked by a shallow concave channel. Finally, the edges of the blade are heavily damaged by corrosion. The long and thin tang in broadly rectangular in cross-section with rounded corners, the end of the tang is truncated as a result of corrosion. 



The following is taken from record DUR-2372A1



This form of spearhead is relatively rare with only 47 examples recorded in the recent volume British Bronze Age Spearheads (Davis 2012). This form of spearhead corresponds with Davis's (2017) Group I form and of Arreton Down metalworking dating to the latest part of the Early Bronze Age, (Early Bronze Age III) which correspondes to Needham's (1996) Period 4 dated c. 1700 - 1500BC and Burgess's Metalworking stage VII.

1000709,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"A copper alloy Middle Bronze Age palstave of South Western type dating to the Taunton/Penard phase (c. 1400 - 1100 BC).



The blade is slightly damaged at both corners, giving it a slightly triangular, truncated appearance, as opposed to its original flaring design. It is now 40.9mm wide at the blade. From this wide point, the blade tapers and becomes more slender and rectilinear, with a marked raised central rib on both faces. This rib is damaged, but the scar indicating its presence is visible where the raised rib itself is missing. It measures 8.2mm wide, and is 60.4mm in length. This rib joins the thickened stop, which is rounded in cross section, akin to two plano-convex shapes adhered to one another at the central point. The stop is 24.2mm wide, and 28.5mm thick. The septum, which is 53.4mm in length, continues to taper from the stop, with the channel between its two raised sides markedly rounded in appearance, with a rounded end where it joins the stop. One of these sides is badly damaged and almost missing. However, when viewed from the side, these two sides create a triangular shape which tapers to its narrowest angle at the butt. The butt is damaged. Possible casting lines are visible, suggesting the palstave may have been unfinished when it was deposited. 



Matt Knight has commented on a similar example: ""Palstaves of this type are typically found across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, as well as further eastwards in Dorset and Wiltshire. One particularly comparable example is a single find from Ashburton, Devon (Pearce 1983, 432-3, No.184, pl.23), though examples with varying decorations are also present in several hoards from Somerset (e.g. Sherford, Taunton Union Workhouse and Edington Burtle).""

The axehead has a long slender butt, tapering gently to the flared blade. It is rectangular in cross section, although the blade narrows to its original cutting surface. It appears undecorated but the surface is pitted and marked across the dark green shiny patina. There is a small area on one side near the blade which has decayed in a different manner, and is now a far brighter green and much more corroded, although there are no signs of bronze disease or ongoing decay. 



It is similar to CORN-68C636, the record for which states that:



Similar slender flat axeheads with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC)....

The object has an irregular sub-circular dished plate with the remains of two curved ovate jets projecting from one side. Both jets taper to faceted terminals which suggest they were cut transversely. A seam extends between the two jets.



The upper surface of the dished plate is pitted and rough. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. 



The metal has a dark brown patina and is worn. The object is 18.8mm long, 16.7mm wide, 3.4mm thick (11.1mm thick including jets) and weighs 4.9g.



Due to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from the Iron Age to Medieval period (c. 800 BC - AD 1500). Casting waste is difficult to date in isolation but the patina and form are suggestive of a Bronze Age - Roman date. The survival of casting waste in this period is relatively rare as it is usually recycled as a bi-product of casting.

1003430,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"Description: Penannular ring of probable Bronze Age date, probably from a composite ring. It is C-shaped in cross-section, with a convex outer and a concave interior. The width of the ring is very consistent but the two ends do not sit quite in line, as if the ring has been slightly bent out of shape. There is a c. 1.5mm gap between the two ends, one of which is slightly incurved and the other slightly outcurved, as if they once joined. The top and bottom edges are neat and parallel, but one is more highly polished than the other, which has a narrow roughened strip by its edge, perhaps keying for solder or perhaps the remains of gold solder.



Dimensions: Diameter 12.7mm, width of ring 5.3mm, thickness of ring 2.1 to 2.4mm, weight 2.8g. 



Discussion: Although penannular rings are well known Bronze Age finds, they normally have circular cross-sections, or sometimes D-shaped. C-shaped cross-sections are unusual, and are normally found on composite rings made from multiple bands soldered together; there is some evidence that this ring may once have been part of a soldered-together composite ring. Although the band widths on composite rings are usually much thinner than this example, the widest composite rings recorded on the PAS database are WILT-788C7B (2019T253) and ESS-71DFE4 (2014T169), where the individual bands are respectively almost 4mm wide, and 4.5mm wide. 



Date: Penannular rings belong to the middle Bronze Age, c. 1300-1150 BC.","As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.",3,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,2018-05-30T23:00:00Z,2020T369,,2.8,,12.7,2.4,,1,Helen Geake,Helen Geake,Eastern,Norfolk,South Norfolk,Caistor St. Edmund,TG2503,,52.57823439,1.31937422,NMS-E93EBA,,59730_E93EBA_BA_Ring.jpg,Bronze Age pennanular ring,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/59730_E93EBA_BA_Ring.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1110162.jpg

1003893,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy&nbsp;flat axehead, dating to 2350-1600 BC.&nbsp;

The axehead is convex on both the front and reverse, creating a pointed oval profile.&nbsp; In cross-section, the cutting edge and butt are also pointed oval, whilst the body is rectangular.&nbsp; The axe is narrowest at the butt and&nbsp;gradually expands into the body before widening abruptly to meet the cutting edge, which is curved with splayed outer sides.&nbsp; Overall, it has a&nbsp;yellowy-brown patina&nbsp;with green mottling and patches of dark red-brown.&nbsp; The axe has&nbsp;extensive pitting on all faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Measurments:&nbsp;length: 84.16mm, width of head: 47.92mm, width of terminal: 15.64mm, maximum thickness: 9.42mm, thickness of blade edge: 2.05mm, thickness of terminal edge: 1.47, weight: 96g.

1004329,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-950,"A complete copper-alloy Middle Bronze Age late looped palstave axehead dating to the Wilburton Industry (Needham Period 6, 1150-950 BC). 



The body of the axhead is roughly sub-rectangular in shape before flattening and flaring outwards to form a wide rounded blade edge and blade tips with slight cutting bevel along the blade edge. A pronounced stop ridge divides the haft from the blade end. Below this the edges narrow slightly and both faces are decorated with three raised longitudinal ribs that extend approximately a third of the way along each of the blade faces. The haft comprises just under half the length of the axehead with pronounced raised edges on either side, sections of which are broken or damaged in palces, that widen in profile to join the stop ridge. The flanges and end of the butt are broken but would have formed an H-shape cross-section. The result is a broadly sub-lozenge-shape profile that expands at the stop-ridge and arrows along the length of the blade. The casting flashes extending along the centre of each side are pronounced at the butt end and visible on each side of the blade but are much more worn. The loop, bridging the stop-ridge on one side, is lozenge-shape in cross-section and sits in line with the casting flash that extends along its surface.



All surfaces of the axehead have a relatively consistent mid-green and brown patina.



The axe measures 140mm in length. The blade is 40mm wide and 1.8mm thick at the cutting edge. The stop is 23mm wide and 30.5mm at its thickest, and the butt is 22.2mm wide and 7.5mm thick. The entire object weighs 353 grams.



This palstave has features causing it to sit between several types. For example Schmidt and Burgess (1981: plate 59, no 815)  illustrate a similar example defined as a group 3 low flanged palstave sleaford type, which has a flared broader blade than this example, the short but narrow form is also similar to transtional types, although these tend to have plainer, if any decoration, while a very similar late example (plate 67 no.928) is identical albeit this example lack the diagnoasic projecting stop ridge typical of late palstaves. It maytherefore appropriate to suggest that this form may date from the as early as group 3 palstaves (c.1400 cal BC) into the Late Bronze Age wilburton period (1200-1000 cal BC) until a parallel within a hoard is identified. Rowlands (1976) does not illustrate any similar examples but focusses primairly on Middle bronze age forms which support a transtional/Late Bronze Age date.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-11-02T00:00:00Z,2019-11-02T00:00:00Z,,,353,,,30.5,140,1,Matthew Fittock,Matthew Fittock,South East,Oxfordshire,South Oxfordshire,Clifton Hampden,SU5395,GPS (from the finder),51.65130221,-1.23532693,BH-4CDE5E,,AxeHead.jpg,Middle Bronze Age late looped palstave axehead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/AxeHead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1106468.jpg

The object is triangular in plan and in cross-section forms a shallow triangle.  It consists of two portions: a pointed blade tip that widens into the remaining small portion of the body and a terminal end, formed by the body then narrowing to a short neck before expanding out to form a sub-circular terminal end; it is not discernable whether the neck and sub-circular terminal are designed features e.g. notches or due to extensive corrosion.

A circular hole perforates the body of the shaft next to one of the loops and there is a parallel semi-circular notch of damage extending into the lower edge of the socketed terminal.



The spear has an even dark-brown patina with small patches of green where pitting occurs across both faces of the blade and the body of the socket.



The spear, when conjoined, measures 79mm in length. The blade is 16mm wide, a maximum of 7mm thick at the axial ridge and 1.2mm thick along the blade edge. The socketed shaft is 7.5mm wide and thick underneath the head. The socketed terminal is 15.6mm diameter and 1.8mm thick.



This looped spearhead is part of the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions and is dated to the Middle Bronze Age between c. 1500 - 1150BC.

1006222,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2400,-2200,"Early Bronze Age copper flat axehead, c. 2400 – 2200BC



The cast flat axe is fragmentary, represented by a butt fragment (with a surviving length of 63.4mm and a weight of 160.6g) and would have been from a large axe. The butt is wide and straight (with a width of 50.3mm and a thickness of 4mm). The sides of the axe were near-straight as far as the break and are gradually divergent (with a maximum width at the break of 58.7mm where the axe has a maximum thickness of 8.8mm). The sides are slightly rounded across their depths, producing a sub-rectangular body section. The axe faces are flat across both their lengths and widths, gradually becoming thicker but with no suggestion of a median bevel or similar feature. 



The surface has a mid-dark brown coarse corrosion with some pale-green corrosion products, possibly indicating copper rather than bronze. 



The axe form is broad butted and is likely to have been a large example. The axe has few developed features but the thinned butt would perhaps suggest an axe of Type Growtown, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p. 23). The fragmentary condition of the axe makes its exact typological identification using Needham’s (2017) classification uncertain. However the suggested copper metallurgy and wide but thinned butt would suggest a lenticular long-profile and indicate a Class 2 axe and the wide, straight butt would indicate a Class 2A or 2B axe. Chalcolithic axes of Class 2 A / B can be dated to Period 1, c. 2400 – 2200BC and are amongst some of the earliest metal objects recorded from Wales.  



A study by Needham (2017) listed four axes of Class 2A or B from Wales and the marches, from Shropshire, Flintshire and Powys.

1006333,Votive Model,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1000,-500,"A complete Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age copper alloy votive model of a miniature wheel dated to c. 1000-500 BC.



The wheel is circular in plan and D-shaped in cross section with each elements of the wheel (its spokes, rim and centre) being convex on the front and flat on the back. The wheel has a trapezoidal shaped 'axel' from which four spokes radiate, narrowing as they do, before joining the outer rim. The holes between each of the axel are sub-oval, almost pointed ovals. There is a circular perforation in the centre of the axle (c.3.0mm diameter) this shows little sign of ware.



The wheel has a dark brown patina with some thicker patches of dark green patina.



The wheel is 20.3mm in diameter, 2.0mm thick and weighs 2.37 grams



There are a growing number of examples of votive wheels on the database. Particularly similar examples to this object include GLO-E82DE1, KENT-9348EE, KENT-70F063, SF-987EE3 and NMS-1CDC66. However,  SWYOR-0B3992, whose additional hole may suggest it was a pastry jigger, and NLM-B563BC, which has an Iron axel suggesting it is the wheel for a toy cannon, demonstrate that such a form is shared by artefacts of other dates and purposes. Later Prehistoric examples can also take different forms including three spokes (e.g. SOM-C30265) or be more bulbous (e.g. HESH-C53CF4).  



A tin example of a wheel, not dissimilar to this example, has been found at Flag Fen (Pryor 2001: 272-273, No.154) which cites parallels found in Late Bronze Age contexts in Switzerland (Pryor 2001: 291). A further example of this type is held by the British Museum (accession No. 1989,0601.21) found in an Iron Age Hoard while a more bulbous example is held by the British Museum (Accession NO. 1864,0501.11).

1007487,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1150,"A fragment of an incomplete gold band or ribbon of rectangular shape, now in two pieces, of Bronze Age date (2100 BC - 1150 BC).



Description: The parallel sided strip of gold has twelve (possibly thirteen) embossed longitudinal lines visible on both faces, giving a corrugated effect. Both ends appear to be breaks, and the strip has broken into two pieces post-recovery. Both long edges are folded making a thicker edge. About 2.6mm - 2.8mm of the sheet is folded over on each edge. This flange is damaged and partially missing on one long edge, and partially unfolded. There is some modern damage on the outer face of the larger piece, in the form of transverse scratches across the face. The whole object is bent and creased and was probably more crumpled when first found, the modern break appearing to be along a previous fold. 



The finder took the object to be tested by a jeweller who reports that it is 20ct and 5g. Short piece: 29.9mm long, 14.2mm wide, 1.3mm thick as folded. The sheet is 0.3mm thick. Larger piece: 47.6mm long, 14.7mm wide, 0.6mm thick as folded. The sheet is 0.4mm thick. 



Discussion: Several ribbons of Bronze Age date have been previously reported as Treasure. Many of these have incised decoration on one face only, rather than the ribbed and corrugated effect seen on this piece. An example is WAW-C0C0B3 (2007 T672) which is published as number 38 on page 47 and 303 of the 2007 Treasure Annual Report.



Examples with embossed linear decoration include WMID-3CBCF0 (2013 T471) for which the record by Teresa Gilmore and Neil Wilkin notes that ""Similar multi-grooved strips of a Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48) [this is mentioned above and is only decorated on one side]. A very similar strip from Sproxton, North Yorkshire is recorded on the PAS database as LVPL-83FE92 [2010 T664]. There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England."". Another similar examples is WMID-FE3C28 (2016 T1039).



The embossed rather than incised decoration makes an early Bronze Age date seem more likely, but a date in the middle to late Bronze Age cannot be entirely discounted.","This object is made of precious metal and is more than 300 years old, so it appears to meet the requirements of the 1996 Treasure Act.",4,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2020-04-30T23:00:00Z,2020-05-30T23:00:00Z,2020T516,,5,,,1.3,76.5,1,Amy Downes,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,Doncaster,Doncaster,Askern,SE5713,Generated from computer mapping software,53.6104616,-1.13994135,SWYOR-DBF058,,SWYORDBF058UnknownUnidentifiedObjectikw.jpg,SWYOR-DBF058 Unknown Unidentified Object,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ikw1945/SWYORDBF058UnknownUnidentifiedObjectikw.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1120891.jpg
1007535,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed knife of Thorndon Type and of Ewart Park metalworking, corresponding with Needham’s Period 7, dated to c. 950-750BC



The cast knife is near-complete, but in two fragments, broken across the slightly distorted blade (with a distorted length of 134.4mm and a weight of 37.7g). The socket has a sub-oval mouth (21.8mm x 12.7mm external, 17.6mm x 10.0mm and 33.2mm deep) and has gently concave, waisted sides (with a minimum width of 18.6mm). The socket faces are gradually convergent towards the blade and have two perforations to secure handle, the upper perforation is central and larger (at 5.1mm – 5.9mm diameter) and the lower is towards one side, smaller and somewhat irregular on one face (at 4.4mm – 6.5mm) and may be a secondary attachment attempt. One side of the socket sides has a sub-linear opening (18.8mm long 2.5mm – 5.2mm wide), probably a casting flaw. The socket and the blade have a near-linear junction, helping to define the knife as Thorndon type. The blade is both widest and thickest beneath the socket (with a width and thickness of 19.9mm and 4.2mm respectively and a minimum thickness above the tip of 0.8mm). The edges are convergent and concave below the socket (for 18mm) before being straight and gently convergent until just above the tip (14mm). The blade has a flattened midsection (8.8mm wide at the socket and 3.2mm wide above the tip), flanked by gently concave blade facets and giving a hexagonal blade section.  Both blade edges have considerable damage and nicks, all of which have patinated surfaces, suggesting, they may be contemporary with the use of the knife, or may have occurred post deposition but some time ago. The blade has a shallow S-shaped bend, at the top and mid blade, which is likely to have resulted in the break. The surface on one face is heavily-pitted around both the bend and break. The surface has a pale to mid green patina with no clear evidence for sharpening striations on the blade edge. 



Thorndon Socketed knives have a distribution perceived as being concentrated in Southern England. As of 2006, there were seven recorded socketed knives of Thorndon type know from south- western Britain, and specifically Wales (Gwilt, 2006, p 54)[1] , with a largely North Wales distribution and with only one outlier in South Wales, recovered within the St Nicholas hoard from the Vale of Glamorgan. Since then a hoard from Glascoed in Monmouthshire also contained a fragment of a Thorndon type socketed knife and another two examples have been recorded with PAS[2] from Bridgend and Newport in South Wales. There are no examples recorded with PAS from Gloucestershire at the time of writing. The Thorndon type knives from the South Wales hoards are associated with Ewart Park metalworking but both hoards also contain an element of the Carp’s Tongue complex.



The two fragments were found approximately 3.5m apart and were at a depth of approximately 0.12m, seemingly within ploughsoil and separated by the plough.

The axehead is complete (with an overall length of 97.0mm and a weight of 261.8g). The mouth is sub-rectangular (52.3mm long and 43.7 wide) and the four casting runner stubs are evident and raised, positioned on the inner lip of the mouth. There is some damage around one of the runner stubs, with a crack which extends down the face (for 17mm). The socket is rectangular (34.3mm x 30.5.0mm and 71.3mm deep).&nbsp; The mouth moulding has a rounded step (6mm &ndash; 7mm long) well-defined on one face, with a prominent step to the face. The oval sectioned loop springs from the moulding (5mm wide, 6mm thick and 35mm long), enclosing a D-shaped loop (15.9mm x 6.5mm). The sides are gently concave with a minimum width below the loop (40.0mm) before widening to a moderately expanded blade edge (52.3mm wide). The blade edge survives and is gently curved at the centre before curving out to the blade tips. There are a series of nicks at the blade edge, mostly in the central area and appear to be beneath the patina. One side has some damage, which has cut through the patina. The casting seams are prominent and raised (up to 2mm high) but have been neatly finished. The sides are slightly bevelled towards the central seam but are comparatively straight for the type, producing a near-rectangular body section. Both faces are decorated with three near-parallel ribs, which extend a little over half the length of the face (for 55mm). The ribs on one face are interrupted and poorly cast. The edges of the faces appear slightly developed to resemble weak ribs. The faces are gently convex across both their lengths and widths, with one face being more convex in both plains than the other and there are no blade facets. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running off the blade. The blades on both faces have a marked colour difference to the remainder of the faces (12mm from the edge). The axe has a black patination, probably of tenorite, as observed on other contemporary axes. The pale-green patination on the blade end, suggests that the tenorite was removed during the axe finishing. The probable tenorite is also evident over the top of the runner stubs. Numerous small hammer facets are also evident on the blades, below the ends of the ribs. 

The socketed axe is typical of the South Wales (Stogursey) Type, although the near-rectangular body section is a little unusual. The clear patination difference on the end of the blade is of interest to the research informing the deliberate colouring of Late Bronze Age metalwork.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,261.8,,,,97,1,,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Pont-y-Clun,ST0580,,51.5109127,-3.3703334,NMGW-07EA87,,201919copy1.jpg,Bronze Age South Wales type Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/201919copy1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1110105.jpg

1008028,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"Bronze Age tanged chisel of Late Bronze Age date, probably of Wilburton or Ewart Park metalworking industry, corresponding with Needham’s (1996) Periods 6-7, dated to c. 1150 – 750BC



The cast chisel is near-complete with a slightly distorted tang (with a length of 50.8mm and a weight of 15.9g). The tang (32.6mm long) is square to rectangular sectioned gradually narrowing to the end (6mm square at the collar and 3.0mm x 1.4mm at the end). There is a perpendicular step to the collar (2mm deep) of sub-oval form (11.1mm long and 9.3mm wide) and narrows below the flanged shoulder (with a minimum width of 7.8mm). The sides of the blade are curved and divergent to the slightly damaged blade tips and the blade edge is near-straight, curved at the ends (giving a blade width of 20.5mm). The original blade edge has been lost with no definite evidence for differential wear across the blade edge. The blade faces are near-flat and thin gradually towards the edge (with a thickness of 7mm below the shoulder and 0.8mm above the edge) and with no evidence for blade facets. There are striations beneath the patina on both faces, running both along the blade and up the blade. The surface is pitted with a mid-green patina and areas of surface loss. 



Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Earliest Iron Age. An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the many may be dated to the Ewart Park phase (c.950-700 BC) and into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65). Another example was found at Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No 288.3) associated with a socketed gouge and a fragmentary Hallstatt 'C' sword.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,15.9,,,7,50.8,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Bremhill,ST9875,,51.47395858,-2.03018701,NMGW-E96F08,,NMWPA201926.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/NMWPA201926.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1110779.jpg
1008175,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1000,"Middle to Late Bronze Age socketed axehead of uncertain type, possibly related to Type Wallington (Schmidt &amp; Burgess, 1980, p. 175-6)[1] of Wilburton Wallington metalworking dated to c. 1300 &ndash; 1000BC

The cast axehead is complete (with a length of 102.6mm and a weight of 242.2g). The interior of the mouth is oval (27.2mm x 190mm) and the top irregular with the suggestion of four-runner casting. The exterior of the mouth is sub-rectangular (39.6mm x 27.5mm) with a prominent rounded mouth moulding or collar (3mm &ndash; 6mm thick and 10mm -13mm long) and has a noticeable shelf on the sides. The corners of the moulding are noticeably angular. The loop (19.4mm long, 11.0mm high and 7.0mm wide) springs from the base of the moulding. The sides of the axe are straight and near-parallel on their upper half and flat across the depths, producing a rectangular body section to the axe. The lower half of the axe sides are divergent, with the unlooped side being near-straight and the looped side gently concave. The flattened casting seams are evident on both sides and are both off-centre. The axe is widest across the expanded blade (with a blade width of 46.8mm) and has a moderate curvature (6mm deep).&nbsp; The faces are near-flat across their widths and convergent but convex across their lengths with no blade facets or ribs present. The surface is corroded with a rough corrosion product and dark-green patina. There is a clear discernible black surface beneath the corrosion on the upper two-thirds of the axe, probably tenorite.

The interior of the socket has at least two small fragments of copper alloy wedged at its base. One fragment appears to be plate bronze and may be an axe wall fragment or similar, the other fragment below is thicker with a right-angled corner, possibly a blade.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The axe appears to share some characteristics of early socketed axes, principally it&rsquo;s slender rectangular body section, mouth moulding and parallel sides. This axe also has some more developed features, such as the expanded blade with divergent sides above the blade. The angular corners of the moulding may be seen as similar to Amorican axes of Llyn Fawr metalworking but the mouth is clearly not of front-back form. An early, Wallington is possible but a later Ewart Park (c. 1000 &ndash; 700BC) date is perhaps more likely.

Discussion: Penannular rings are not uncommon finds reported Treasure and recorded on the PAS database. Other examples featuring similar ‘tiger striped’ decoration include: 2019 T1091 (HAMP-BE4072) and 2020 T780 (NLM-59A99B). The report and PAS database record for 2020 T77 (OXON-FFD016) notes that ring “appears similar to a class of artefact which have in the past been given various terms such as 'hair-rings' (Eogan 1997) and other monikers such as ‘Ring Money’ (Green 1988) which are now no longer supported (Taylor 1980, 65; Varndell 2001). Their function remains uncertain (Varndell 2001, 516), although it is likely that they were personal adornments (Hobbs 2003 opinion cited, 102-107), possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange”.","In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

The awl is square in cross section along most of its length, and tapers to a circular cross-sectioned point at one terminal. At the other terminal it flattens to become rectangular in cross-section, before ending in a chisel-shaped terminal.

Awls are generally considered to be Later Bronze Age in date (c.1600-800 cal BC) however, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.31,,,3.85,91.94,1,Denise Wilding,Denise Wilding,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Broad Chalke,SU0223,,51.00638245,-1.97286895,WILT-BC913A,,WILTBC913A.jpg,Bronze Age awl,Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/denisewilding/WILTBC913A.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1111612.jpg

It comprises a crumpled strip of sheet or ribbon gold around 63.7mm in length, decorated with around 10 parallel ridges running along its length across one side; the reverse is undecorated. There is a partial tear across the mid section, probably from post depositional damage. The object has a rounded terminal with a ragged pierced oval hole. The other end of the object tapers into a narrow square-sectioned hook which curves under the plate and ends up 2mm wide. The surface of this terminal is smooth and undecorated, with the ridged decoration stopping short of it.  



Length: 63.7mm; Width: 9.8mm; Thickness: 0.3mm; Weight: 3.5g.","This appears to be a flattened item of personal adornment, originally secured in a loop using the hook and piercing and perhaps used as an earring, or finger ring. The presence of these features places this example into a less common group of Bronze Age ribbon gold artefacts found with fittings. Eogan (1994) has categorised these objects as ‘Tress’-rings, including them in his discussion of gold working in the mid to late Bronze Age. More generally, there are a range of comparable ribbon gold ornaments known from the duration of the Bronze Age, particularly from the 'ornament horizon' of the Taunton and Penard phases of the Middle Bronze Age (Roberts 2007).  This object also however finds parallels in its form within the earlier Bronze Age sheet gold tradition and an excavated example found in Oxford in a sealed alluvial deposit along with a Beaker period flint scraper and pottery (Palmer 1980) suggests that an early Bronze Age date for this type of artefact is entirely possible.

1008904,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-750,"A complete gold penannular bar bracelet, dating to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1400BC-750BC).

Description:&nbsp;The bracelet is composed of a cylindrical bar, curved to create a sub-oval shape in plan. The terminals of the bar are slightly expanded and, from the photograph,&nbsp;appear sub-circular in section with short, incised linear decoration.

1010372,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,950,750,"A cast bronze (copper alloy) faceted socketed axe of late Bronze Age date (950 &ndash; 750&nbsp;BC). The axe is relatively short and stubby and is known as &lsquo;baggy axe&rsquo;. 

The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with concave sides and a flared convex cutting edge. The mouth of the socket is broadly oval. The mouth of the socket has a moulded collar, although some of the original surface is missing. Visible on one side only below the collar are two moulded ribs as decoration. At the base of the collar, on one edge are the remains of a loop. All that remains now of the loop are two circular incomplete projections with well-developed patinas. 

The two long sides of the axe are concave at the centre before expanding to a crescent shaped blade. The casting seams are visible on both long edges.&nbsp;The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge, although much of the original surface has been lost from abrasion and corrosion. Therefore it is difficult to establish how well used and worn the original blade edge was in antiquity.

The socketed axe head has a dark brown coloured patina across all surfaces with some areas of active corrosion around the socket. There are many areas where the original surface has been lost especially around the blade and on the socket mouth. There is no evidence of organic residue within the socket of the axe. 

Thanks are given to Peter Reavill for his help in identifying this type of axe. He has recorded a similar example discovered in Shropshire (HESH-07A7E3) Here he explains the parallels&hellip;.

These axes have been discovered in associated with the late Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase XI) and the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham&rsquo;s (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-700 CAL.&nbsp;BC. This axe is of a type which is known as Type Gillespie, which Burgess and Schmidt suggest is associated with later Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase XI) and Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). They are also discovered in Ireland and are associated with the Dowris tradition. It has been suggested that this form of facet axe continues production into the Llyn Fawr tradition (which is the transitional period between the metalwork of the Bronze and Iron Ages). Similar axes have been illustrated in Burgess and Schmidt and the best parallels are cat no 1101 Kilkerran, Scotland, 1109 Graham&rsquo;s Mount, and 1112 Hatton, Angus. A more local example can be seen in the Savory Welsh catalogue from a small hoard of axes discovered at Llandaff, Glamorganshire (cat no 282). This Welsh axe had been analysed and the metal content was comparable with axes from the second phase of the Late Bronze Age (LBA&nbsp;II) which Savory dates 750-600&nbsp;BC&nbsp;but would actually be better described as Ewart Park 950-750&nbsp;BC.

The axe measures 77.8 mm length, 49.7 mm width, is 40.2 mm thick, the thickness of the walls of the axe measure 6.8 mm on one side and 6.4 mm on the other. It weighs 191.9 grams.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,191.9,,,40.2,77.8,1,,Victoria Allnatt,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Staffordshire Moorlands,Alton,SK0641,,52.96632952,-1.91211471,WMID-249A43,,WMID249A43.jpg,"Bronze Age Axe (front, profile, back, profile, blade edge and socket edge)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/vallnatt/WMID249A43.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1116072.jpg

1010922,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy / bronze ribbed socketed axe of later Bronze Age / Ewart Park date (c. 950-800 BC). 



Description: The axehead is relatively robust with a square shaped mouth and relatively straight sides which expand at each end. The blade ends expands to a short cutting edge. The mouth of the axehead is fairly worn but appears to be poorly finished with casting flash seam lines still prominent along the sides and continuing down the body of the axehead towards the blade edge. The mouth moulding / collar around the mouth is swollen with a prominent bulbous or convex external ridge. Beneath this is a slight transverse moulded rib which extends across both faces and sides and is aligned with the upper edge of the side loop. The side loop is relatively small and wide being set in a tight position beneath the collar in line with this horizontal rib. The loop is D shaped in cross section.



On the front and rear faces of the axe, six parallel longitudinal ribs descend from the lower edge horizontal rib. The ribs are complete on one side and terminate in blunt points halfway along thebody. One wide face near the socket is incomplete having been broken in antiquity. The external edges of the axe are also slightly raised giving the impression of six descending ribs. The cutting edge is also straight and may have been heavily reworked. Overall the axehead has a mid-green patina towards the blade and dark grey-green towards the socket particularly on the sides. Most damage seems to have been heavily patinated indicating it occurred in antiquity. 



Measurements: 100.82mm long, 43.75mm wide (including loop, collared mouth 39.53mm wide), 27.3mm thick and 178.88g in weight. 



Discussion: The axehead dates to the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age 950 - 750 BC and due to the straight sides the date range may also fit with Bronze - Iron Age transition period known as Llyn Fawr which extends the date range to c. 650 BC. Needham (1996) period 7-8 Metalworking stage XII - XIII.  The form roughly fits the South-Eastern types illustrated in Schmidt & Burgess (1981).

The objects comprise:





1)    An incomplete socketed axehead with a single side loop. The tip is missing from what appears to be an ancient break. The socket is irregular in shape, somewhere between sub-rectangular and sub trapezoidal with a thick moulded rim. The cross section of the blade is rectangular at the break; the sides are parallel, suggesting that the cutting edge was relatively narrow.





Length: 101mm; width: 48mm; thickness: 32.7mm; weight: 240.82g.





2)    A fragment of the butt end of a palstave axehead. The corroded remnants of flanges are present on both sides, suggesting it was a long-flanged type; the cross section is H shaped with flat faces between the flanged sides.





Length: 40.6mm; width: 26.6mm; thickness: 13.6mm; weight: 46.42g.





3)    Two fragments of plano-convex copper alloy “bun” ingots: 56.6mm by 46.5mm by 24.8mm, 292.18g; 54.6mm by 55.4mm by 21.2mm, 226.11g. Both are square in plan, with one curved and one flat face and a wedge-shaped side profile.","These objects are all heavily corroded as a result of deposition in acidic greensand soils. The socketed axehead is a typically later Bronze Age type (c 1150 - 600 BC), whilst the flanged palstave is more typical of the middle Bronze Age (c 1500-1100 BC), but is also a common type of inclusion in later mixed assemblages. The bun ingots, with characteristically plano convex surfaces suggesting an origin in a bowl furnace, are also typically a product of the later Bronze Age and are often found in hoards with axeheads such as these and other implements. Due to the degraded nature of the break edges it impossible to say whether these ingot fragments belong to one or multiple ingots.  

The very close proximity of the findspots and overlapping date ranges of the finds strongly suggests that they were originally deposited as a coherent group. The composition of the assemblage is suggestive of a metalworker’s hoard, with the mixture of socketed axehead and copper ingots seen here being most common in the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2020-06-06T23:00:00Z,,2020T781,,,,,,,4,Simon Maslin,Simon Maslin,South East,Surrey,Guildford,Shere,TQ0849,From finder,51.22997929,-0.45460018,SUR-C8315D,,SURC8315D_palstave2.jpg,,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SURC8315D_palstave2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1124176.jpg

Description: The axehead has relatively straight sides which expand towards the base to form a neat cutting edge. The blade edge has a nick out of one corner but is relatively complete and short typical of the type. The axehead is fairly worn but appears to be poorly finished with casting flash and seam lines still prominent along the sides.

1013309,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1100,-800,"A heavily worn fragment of cast Late Bronze Age copper alloy socketed axe head, probably dating to 1100-800 BC.



Description: The fragment represents part of the blade end of the long rectangular socketed body of the axehead. No edge remains intact so over all shape is based on known more complete examples. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips likely flared slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible . The axehead is patinated dark green and mottled light brown to green across the abraded edges.

Discussion: Although, due to completeness it is not certain but this axehead probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,19.37,,,10.42,23.67,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Dover,Eythorne,TR2749,GPS (from the finder),51.19510472,1.24755845,KENT-5D01D6,,KENT5D01D6.jpg,Socketed axehead fragment,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT5D01D6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1118945.jpg
1013388,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A cast copper alloy fragment of a Late Bronze Age sword dating to c.1000-800 BC. The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-oval in section with both ends terminating in old damage. The fragment is a small section of the blade with a convex/raised midrib (14mm wide, max 8.8mm thick) flanked by a pair of parallel longitudinal grooves on either side c.3mm from the long edge on both faces. The grooves do not appear to narrow on the fragment and the distance is the same between the lines at the upper and lower section of the fragment (14mm) although the long edges of the blade are damaged from corrosion so the cutting edge has been lost.



The tip of the object is rounded and pitted with bright green corrosion. The other end has a central concentric depression c.3.5mm in diameter in profile. One side of the blade has 3 small holes, likely corrosion products. 



The fragment is small and lacking diagnostic features so it is difficult to ascribe a type with certainty. A similar sword fragment of Carp’s Tongue type with two longitudinal grooves is illustrated in Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015:99 pl. 26 no. 325) from West Knighton, Dorset. Burgess (1968:22 fig. 13) also illustrates a sword from the River Thames dating to the Carp’s Tongue complex of the Late Bronze Age. The fragment is likely from a Carp’s Tongue type sword of the Ewart Park phase of metalwork.



The object is a medium green patina with patches of bright green corrosion and measures 27.8mm long, 21.5mm wide, 8.8mm thick and weighs 16.05kg.

1013449,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-700,"An incomplete copper alloy socketed axehead dating to the Late Bronze Age (c. 1300-700 BC). The remains of the object consist of the blade edge and part of the body, which terminates in an uneven worn break leaving part of the socketed interior visible. The break is slightly higher on one side of the axehead than the other, thus the tapered sides of the body of the axehead are visible. The blade edge is curved but very worn and chipped. The axehead has a thick dark reddish brown patina in patches across its surface (c. 30%), however much of this has been chipped and abraded away revealing a brown patina underneath. It is not possible to identify whether the axe has been sharpened or whether a casting seam existed due to most of its patina being chipped away. 



The lack of diagnostic features from this axehead fragment prevents a more exact type or parallel for its form being cited, however socketed axeheads are believed to date from the Middle Bronze Age (c.1300 BC) to the Earliest Iron Age (c.700/600 BC).

They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably inserted into a handle made from organic materials. The surface condition and patination of this object is commensurate with an object of some age. However, given the lack of archaeological context, and dating difficulty, a Bronze Age date cannot be assured; therefore, the suggested date range has been widened somewhat.

1015924,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete copper alloy flanged axehead of Later Early Bronze Age to Middle Bronze Age date (2000-1700 BC). The object is a long flanged developed flat axe.



This axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, with some slight recurving.



Shallow ovate cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a lenticular side profile.



There is a raised transverse stop-ridge running half way down the butt length. 



The metal is brown in colour with areas of light blue active copper alloy disease on both faces, predominant on one face but present on the other.

Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, ""...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembelleshed faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature. Decoration...becomes a commonplace...""



Schmidt and Burgess (ibid.) explain that these developments were in part a function of changing hafting methods - the knee handle, with forked angled end required a narrower shape to fit snugly between the prongs of the fork. Furthermore, dished faces and raised edges made the seating more secure, and the median bevel reduced the tendency of the axe to be driven up into the fork, (WMID-143A14).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,439,,,25.84,134.42,1,Ellie Cox,Ellie Cox,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,South Northamptonshire,Hartwell,SP8051,From finder,52.15149812,-0.83215728,NARC-24B0E9,,NARC24B0E9.jpg,NARC-24B0E9 : Axehead : Early-Middle Bronze Age,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC24B0E9.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1122002.jpg

Notes:

The object is consistent with a number of examples which have been determined to be Treasure on the&nbsp;PAS&nbsp;database including 2014T777 (HEMP-36C41B), 2018T642 (NMS-A603B), 217T672 (NMS-B2D198), 2019T991 (DUR-9B1BA0), 2019T866 (HEMP 37143A), 2011T459 (LIN-946F12) and 2020T516 (SWYOR-DBF058). Incised longitudinal grooves are present on at least one side of many of these examples. Some are plain strips whilst others exhibit one or two perforations. Furthermore, the design is redolent of two examples from the multi-period site of Ranvecliffe Cave in Derbyshire, held within the British Museum Collections 1906.1224.1 and 1906.1224.2. These examples were postulated to date to the period between circa 2500-800&nbsp;BC, providing a broad Late Neolithic to Late Bronze Age date. Other dates recorded within the Treasure cases suggest a narrower period between circa 2200-800, encompassing the entirety of the Bronze Age, whilst 2014T777 suggests a Middle to Late Bronze Age date of between circa 1600-800&nbsp;BC. As a result, a broad Bronze Age date is offered here of between circa 2300-800&nbsp;BC. In all of these examples, it is not clear what their function was.",,4,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,2021T434,,4,,,,76.2,1,,Megan Gard,East Midlands,Derbyshire,High Peak,Corbar,SK0475,,53.27197301,-1.9414806,LEIC-28D5B5,,28D5B5.jpg,Gold ribbon,Derby Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/meggard1/28D5B5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1122080.jpg
1016055,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-1601,"A badly corroded copper or copper alloy flat axe of Early Bronze Age date (c. 2350 BC to 1601 BC). It is broadly sub trapezoid in plan, although the axe has lost too much of its original shape to confidently assign it to a type using Schmidt and Burgess (1981). No. 270, pg. 50, Plate 22 has a generally similar shape apart from its smaller, flatter butt. The axe itself has a fairly narrow and rounded butt (36.5mm wide) and appears to have relatively straight sides although one is slightly convex- again it is difficult to tell the original side shape due to the heavy corrosion. The cutting edge is strongly curved and unexpanded. The axe is flat lenticular in profile, and rectangular in section. 



The axe is heavily corroded, with much of the surface covered with active corrosion and corrosion products. This corrosion has led to the total loss of the original surface, changing the shape of the axe. The parts of the axe not covered by corrosion bear a dull red brown patina of uneven, pitted texture. The dull red colour may suggest that the axe is made of copper rather than copper alloy, which would date it to the chalcolithic, the earliest part of the Bronze Age (c. 2500-2200 BC).",,4,Copper,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,253.6,,,10.2,107.8,1,George Whatley,George Whatley,Wales,Carmarthenshire,Carmarthenshire,Llandyfaelog,SN4316,,51.82050768,-4.27932397,NMGW-3B328A,,FlatAxe.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/FlatAxe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1122847.jpg

The object is sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is narrowed and rounded in profile. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. There are no traces of a stop ridge present. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade are abraded as is the blade edge itself.

The metal is dark green/brown in colour with a heavily pitted and corroded patina. 



The axehead date to the Early Bronze Age and fits within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

These are thin and rectangular in cross-section: flat on the internal and external edges of the loop. However, there is a concave bevelled constriction in the middle of both sides, just above the junction with the shank (best viewed from the top).

The shank is oval in cross-section and emerges from the head with a significant concave taper over the first five millimetres of its length. Over approximately this same distance, the longest axis of the oval cross-section is parallel with the plane of the head. After that, the taper is much more subtle and the shank twists so that its long axis is oblique to the plane of the head. It maintains this orientation and taper throughout the rest of its length. The tip is blunt and probably represents a worn break. There is a slight bend in the shank, at just over halfway along its extant length from the head. Most of the shank has a dark green patina, becoming dark brown near and on the stumps of the head. See NMS-3D6677 on this database for a more complete example. c.1400-1250 BC.

1018446,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"A copper alloy long flanged flat axehead of Needham (2017) Type 4d or e dating to the Early Bronze Age c. 2050-1700 cal BC.



Description: This axe head has a rounded arched butt, a body that starts narrow but increasingly widens, a crescentic blade edge and long low flanges. The low flanges are worn to the point they are barely discernable  From this point the body of the axe (the septum) thickens regularly to a point just further than half way along its length (c.45 mm from the butt). At this point there is a shallow, almost imperceptible, thickened ridge, which may indicate the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. 



After the proto stop-ridge the body of the axe thin gradually to the blade edge of the axe. Concurrently the body of the axehead widens in a smooth curve so that the wings at the side of the axeblade are almost perpendicular to the body of the axe. The blade edge itself is crescent shaped and slightly more angled than the narrowing body. One corner has been damaged. The blade edge is slightly bevelled indicating it has been sharpened at least once. The surface of the axehead is heavily patinated and surfacely pitted. It has a mottled dark green through to light grey-green colouration



Measurements: 99.39mm long, 50.82mm wide (at blade end, 23.1mm wide at mid point, 17.82mm wide at butt end), 12.67mm thick and 156.59g in weight



Discussion: This is a low flanged axe of Early Bronze Age date. The lack of developed stop ridge suggests it most likely dates to the later stages of the Early Bronze Age. Needham (1983, 2017) has produced a typology of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age flat and flanged axeheads that defines them based on the ratios of their physical form (Needham 2017, 4, Table 1). This axe meets all the criteria for a Type 4e Axehead and most closely corresponds to a Type 4E Withington form (Needham, 2017, 27-29, 55-56). Needham places the date of this type of axe to between the 20th and 18th centuries cal BC c. 1900-1700 cal BC (ibid 45, fig 16).



These axes are traditionally assigned to the Long Flanged or Developed Flat Axe of Aylesford type (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981) that fit with Burgess’ metalworking tradition phase IV, and corresponds to Needham’s (1996) Period 3 (circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC)

The casting seams and associated flashes on either side (long edge) have been trimmed and hammered almost flat. An integrally cast side loop descends on one edge; it is positioned immediately below the stop towards the blade. The loop is D-shaped in cross-section.  Below the stop ridge of the axe on the upper blade is a central rib which continues towards the cutting edge of the blade, tapering to flatness at about 25mm from the cutting edge. The rib is present on both faces - although better defined on one. Each face has two further ribs which run from the butt to join the central rib at 20mm towards the blade - again one side is more defined. The palstave has a well-defined polished dark green/brown coloured surface patina which is pitted and broken in places, exposing areas of corrosion, particularly along the external and raised edges.



Measurments: length: 170mm; width (across the blade): 61.63mm; width (across the butt): 20.8mm; thickness (across the stop): 25.22mm; thickness (of the septum in the mid point of the butt): 7.14mm. The side flanges raise to a height of 9.2mm above the septum. The axehead weighs 387.6 grams.

1019074,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-800,"Bronze Age bronze double-edged tanged and riveted knife of Middle to Late Bronze Age date



The cast knife blade is fragmentary by the tang and top of the blade (with a surviving length of 85.0mm and weight of 14.2g). The tang (48mm long) is narrowest and thinnest at the butt (10.6mm wide and 0.9mm thick) which has a slight indent at the centre. Below the butt is a sub-circular perforation (4.0mm – 4.3mm diameter positioned 5.3mm below the butt). The sides of the tang are straight and gently divergent towards the top of the blade (reaching a width and thickness of 14.9mm and 2.8mm respectively). Both tang faces are convex across their widths, producing a sub-rectangular section. The knife widens to the blade at the shoulders, where the knife has a maximum width (of 18.8mm), below which it narrows (for 20mm) before the blade edges appear to have been near-parallel sided (with a minimum width at the break of 8.9mm and a thickness of 1.5mm). The blade has a mid-ridge at the break, producing a lozengic section. Towards the top of the blade, the mid-ridge bifurcates to form a triangular panel, corresponding with the widening of the blade edge to the shoulders. The blade edge is damaged but blade facets are partially preserved on both sides. There is no clear evidence for blade damage that is contemporary with the use of the blade. The blade and tang now have a gentle bend across their length. The surface has numerous linear striations beneath the patina, running across both tang faces (at an angle of 20° – 40° to the vertical axis of the tang) resulting from coarse finishing. The blade have coarse, irregular striations running along the top of the blade and the suggestion of finer striations running off the blade edges. There is a possible punched mark at the top of the mid-ridge and a corresponding dent at the same position on the opposite face, suggesting that the blade was punched while resting on edge. The surface has a dark-green to black patina with a white deposit on the tang, concentrated around the perforation.   



Tanged and riveted knives are recovered in a variety of forms from the Middle Bronze Age onwards, though western British examples are not common. Studies (Pearce (1983), Knight et al. (2015) and Rowlands (1976, Pl.35)) illustrates two shouldered tanged knives with single rivet holes from Southern Britain, one from the River Thames, Berkshire, and another from Horningsea, Cambridgeshire. Rowlands considers tanged and riveted knives as belonging to the later Middle Bronze Age (Penard phase c.1275-1150BC). Comparable examples have been closely linked with Late Bronze Age material. Examples are present in the Grays Thurrock hoard, Essex (Turner 2010, No.02/134), and the Reach Fen hoard, Cambridgeshire (Smith 1956, GB.17 3(3) No.43), both of which are part of the Carp's Tongue complex in the Ewart Park phase (1000-800BC).

1019089,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-750,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze palstave fragment of indeterminate type 



The cast looped palstave fragment has lost the blade, butt and loop and is represented by the stop fragment (with a surviving length of 46.6mm and a weight of 106.4g). The sides of the palstave are straight for their short lengths, either side of the breaks. The butt end is sub-rectangular sectioned at the break (17.8mm x 12.2mm), slightly concave across the width of the septum and has lost the flanges. One side has a prominent raised stub (giving a maximum surviving width of 26.4mm) from the remains of the loop. The stops are truncated slightly (with a height above the septum of 5 -6mm and a thickness of 24.0mm) and are straight and vertical. The top of the stops are bevelled to the blade, which is of sub-rectangular section at the break (20.9mm x 15.4mm), with convex faces, across their widths. There is the suggestion of ribs at the top of the blade faces but now lost to corrosion. Both breaks occurred in antiquity and the position of the breaks may suggest deliberate damage to the palstave. The surface is worn and corroded with a dark-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion.



The fragmentary state of the palstave makes typological identification indeterminate but the slender form with a loop would suggest Low Flanged.

1019111,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1500,"Blade fragment from a Bronze Age axehead of uncertain type, probably of Early Bronze Age date, c. 2000 – 1500BC



The cast axehead is fragmentary, represented by the blade and is comparatively small (with a surviving length of 32.3mm and a weight of 18.2g).The body is rectangular-sectioned at the break (with a width of 17.8mm and a thickness of 5.1mm) and the sides are straight and moderately divergent, before diverging more sharply to the expanded blade edge, now worn (with a blade width of 26.6mm).  The sides are heavily-corroded and pitted but there is the suggestion of a casting seam evident on both sides. The faces are largely flat, before converging to the blade edge with a discernible blade facet (7mm from the blade edge). There is a slight bend across the length of the blade, suggesting the axe was bent prior to breaking. The corroded and pitted surface has a dark-green patina with areas of bright-green surface loss. 



The small and corroded blade fragment is difficult to identify in relation to typological features. The form is perhaps best paralleled with Early Bronze Age flat axes or Developed axe types and the narrow straight sided form and with a blade facet is suggestive of Developed types. The diminutive size may suggest an ‘axe-chisel’.  Flat and Developed axe types are associated with Metalworking Assemblages II – VI, corresponding with Needham’s (1996)[1] later Period 2 –to Period 4 but Developed types are of Periods 3-4, c. 2000 – 1500BC

1019114,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1200,"Copper alloy socketed fitting of uncertain function and date, possibly Bronze Age



The fitting is cast and is fragmentary broken in antiquity at one end (with a surviving length of 39.5mm and a weight of 38.6g). The mouth is irregular and sub-circular (with an internal diameter of 15mm – 18mm and a maximum thickness of 3.2mm) before a bulbous collar (with a maximum diameter of 26.3mm). The fitting gradually narrows before being near-parallel sided, gently convergent to the break (with a diameter of 16mm – 177mm). Immediately beneath the break are integral lugs now truncated (8mm -9mm long, 4mm thick with a surviving height of 2.3mm). The lugs had a circular perforation, suggesting both may have been loops. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a dark, olive-green patina and areas of pale-green surface loss. Where the surface survives, beneath the loops, there are irregular striations from finishing.



The identification and date of the object is uncertain. The looped lugs on opposite sides of a socket is similar to socketed spearheads of Early to Middle Bronze Age date, of Davis’ (2012) Group 2 – 7 of Arreton, Acton Park and Taunton Metalworking, corresponding with Needham’s (1996)[1] Periods 4 -5, and dated to c. 1700 – 1200BC. However a bulbous mouth on a socketed spearhead would be very unusual and is difficult to parallel. Additionally, the narrow looped lugs with thin circular perforations would by unusual.

The blade is fragmentary, represented by the incomplete butt and top of the blade (with a surviving length of 61.5mm and a weight of 40.0g). The butt is of irregular trapezoidal form and is thinnest at the end (with a maximum width of 45.6mm and a minimum thickness of 2.3mm). There are no obvious rivet holes surviving on the butt although a slight recess near the centre of the top edge may possibly be the remnants of a rivet hole. A central ridge is evident just before the end of the butt and develops as a prominent mid-ridge on the top of the blade. The butt is asymmetric, with three edges on one side and two on the other, although the maximum width of the butt from the central ridge is consistent on both sides. The butt both narrows and thickens to the top of the blade (with a width of 31mm and a thickness of 4.9mm). The blade narrows further towards the break (to 24.0mm wide and 5.2mm thick). The prominent mid-ridge along the blade creates a lozengic blade section. The blade edges have been lost on both sides. There are a number of striations running at different angles off the edges of the butt that appear to be preserved beneath the patina and are discernible on both faces. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of grey-green surface loss and bright-green corrosion.



The fragmentary state of the blade and loss of diagnostic features makes identification difficult. The trapezoidal butt form and prominent mid-ridge on the blade may tentatively suggest a Group II – III blade but the lack of rivet holes further complicates any identification. The butt is comparatively substantial, possibly suggesting a larger weapon, perhaps a Group III rapier ‘with damaged butt’.

The cast flat axe is incomplete somewhat truncated and with considerable peripheral damage (with a maximum surviving length of 141.3mm and a weight of 356.0g) and has no developed features, comprising a sub-triangular bronze slab. The damaged butt is narrow and arched (with a width of 20mm and a thickness of 5.2mm). The sides are somewhat damaged but appear to be near-straight and divergent or gently concave, before widening more sharply near the blade (with a surviving blade edge width of 64.2mm and a thickness of 6.1mm) but not expanded. The straight blade does not have an edge and it is unclear whether the edge is truncated or was unworked. Both faces are flat (10.6mm 50mm from the blade end), although one face more so and suggests it was in contact with the mould during casting. The original surface has been lost and the surface is heavily-pitted and has a bright-green and light-brown corrosion. Damage at the sides (54mm) from the butt exposes a lamination running along the axe and evident from both sides and probably the result of the casting process. 



The axe has few diagnostic or developed features and has lost most of the edges, making any identification uncertain. The ‘as-cast’ face suggests that the axe is unworked and therefore may be interpreted as an axe blank. The general form with narrow butt and broad blade is perhaps closer to Migdale axe forms and suggests a contemporary date Visual analysis suggests the metal is a bronze, rather than copper but it has not been possible to scientifically test the alloy. If possible, analysis later may provide further evidence for the date of the axe.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,356,,,6.1,141.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,New Moat,SN0721,,51.8541318,-4.80382799,NMGW-457F5C,,2017159new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017159new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126210.jpg
1019121,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1450,"Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group I, Primary Shield Pattern type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981)[1] and of Acton Park 1 metalworking Industry corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 4 and probably dated to c. 1600 – 1450BC



The palstave is near-complete, missing the top of the flanges and with some surface damage (with an overall length of 157mm and a weight of 316.0g). The butt (with a width of 24.0mm and a thickness of 5.0mm) is straight and is slightly angled. The sides are straight and near-parallel to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 26.2mm, where the axe has a depth of 31.6mm). Below the stop (13mm below) both sides have a transverse rib or nicked-sides. The sides are moderately divergent beneath the nicks, producing a comparatively narrow and unexpanded blade edge (with a blade width of 52.0mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly finished. The flanges rise from the butt and have a straight top edge, the tops are now truncated but probably reached their maximum heights above the stop (16mm above the stop and with a maximum surviving height of 29.7mm). The septum is flat and is near-perpendicular to the flanges and stops (with heights of 11.4mm and 12.9mm). The stops have a slight curve across their width and are very slightly under-cut. The stops are also raised above the faces (with a height of 8.6mm and a thickness of 4.0mm - 6.8mm). The flanges extend onto the faces (for 20mm), before converging together as a shield moulding, enclosing a shallow depression. Both faces also have a midrib beginning below the stop and forming a trident decoration with the shield. The faces have a sub-rectangular section but slightly convex and with a midrib.  There is no obvious blade facet on the unexpanded edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina, which has laminated to a mid-brown surface above a green-brown surface.



This palstave does not closely correspond with the two subtypes proposed by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) but is closer to their Type Acton Park but is considerably smaller than most palstaves of the type and also has a trident decoration, rather than a shield.

1019123,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1600,"Blade fragment from an axehead of uncertain type and date, probably a Developed Flat Axe of Early Bronze Age date.



The axehead is fragmentary and heavily-corroded (with a surviving length of 52.5mm and a weight of 72.7g). The break occurred in antiquity and at the break, the axe body is slender and of sub-rectangular section (with a width of 22.3mm and a thickness of 8.9mm). The sides diverge moderately (for 24mm) before expanding sharply to produce an expanded blade edge (with a width of 50.0mm and an expanded edge length of 17mm). The faces are flat across their widths and also their lengths before a curved blade facet (19mm from the blade edge), positioned at the point where the blade is expanded. The edges of the faces appear to have slight ridges, seemingly the remnant ends of corroded flanges. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with no original surface surviving. But has a mid to bright green corrosion. 



The probable presence of flanges on the edges of the face would suggest the axehead was of a developed type. The fragmentary condition of the axehead makes further typological identification difficult and speculative. The slender body expanding sharply to a possible recurved blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 65-8)[1]. Developed Flat axes relate to Metalworking Assemblages IV -V and date to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, dated to c. 2050 – 1700BC. Type Bandon Axes probably relate to the Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V) with a proposed date range of c. 1900 – 1600BC.

The fragmentary cast axe is represented by a blade fragment only (with a surviving length of 27.3mm, a blade edge width of 50.6mm, a maximum thickness of 12.3mm and a weight of 44.6g). The base of the socket is evident at break and is rectangular form (38.7mm x 7.0mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 14.6mm).

The surface has remnant patches of a dark-brown patina and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion. 



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base would imply a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries.

The cast socketed axe is incomplete and damaged, missing the blade, an area of the mouth and is also perforation through one face (with a surviving length of 66.0 and a weight of 151.9g). The incomplete mouth is sub-rectangular to oval (48.5mm x 34.4mm (surviving)) and similarly the top of the socket is sub-rectangular (32.0mm x 26mm (incomplete)). The top of the mouth is moderately flat and has the suggestion of two, possibly three of the casting runner stubs, now corroded and worn. The mouth moulding is ‘lip-like’ and is short (5mm) and rounded. The loop springs from the base of the moulding (26mm long, 11.2mm high, 6.5mm wide) and is complete, enclosing a rounded D-shaped aperture (8.5mm x 6.1mm) with low casting flashes evident on the interior. The sides are near-straight for their surviving lengths, narrowing beneath the mouth before beginning to widen towards the missing blade, above the break (where the axe has a width of 40.0mm and depth of 13mm). The casting flashes are evident on both sides but are finished and rounded. The axe has broken above the socket base, leaving a slender oval aperture (24.0mm x 5.8mm) at the base. The sides of the axe are gently convex across the widths, giving the axe a near rectangular body section. The faces are straight and gradually convergent for the surviving lengths. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs and there is the suggestion that the face sides have also been enhanced to suggest ribs. Both faces were damaged during antiquity.  A pointed implement has been used to punch through the upper part of one face and the missing part of the opposite face is likely to be a result of the same action. Additionally, it seems likely that the blade has been removed. The surface is heavily-worn and corroded with a mid-green patina and may have been heat-affected, as evidenced by the coarse and crystalline-like surface condition. There is the suggestion of a black patina, partially preserved, possibly tenorite.



The damage on the axe appears to be deliberate, suggesting deliberate destructive treatment of the axe prior to deposition. Blade removal of the axe is unlikely to have occurred during normal use and experimental archaeology has indicated that an axe has to be heated to a high temperature to remove the blade, possibly resulting in the suggested heat-affected surface.   



The axe is of clear South Wales type but also has minor variations to the typical form, specifically the lipped mouth moulding, the suggestion of ribbed edges to the face and a more rectangular, rather than hexagonal body section.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,151.9,,,34.4,66,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Powys,Powys,Talybont-on-Usk,SO1123,,51.89841221,-3.29488981,NMGW-481C47,,NMWPA201942.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/NMWPA201942.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126301.jpg
1019150,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of uncertain type probably South Wales (Stogursey) or allied Type and of Ewart Park Metalworking, dating from c. 950 &ndash; 750BC

The cast axe is fragmentary, missing the mouth, one side and much of the faces (with a length of 78.1mm, a maximum surviving breadth of 26.2mm and a weight of 86.4g). The better preserved side has a small area of the mouth surviving, which is slightly out-turned (with a thickness of 4.8mm) with no discernible evidence for a collar moulding. The socket is of rounded rectangular form (with a depth of 60.9mm). The casting seam is raised, extenuated by a slight mismatching in the mould alignment but is neatly finished. The sides are moderately angled to the central seam, giving a sub-hexagonal body section to the axe. The side is straight along its length before a gentle expansion at the blade. The blade is very slightly expanded (with a blade width of 43.2mm) and has a modest curve (with a depth of 10mm). The original blade edge has been lost.&nbsp; The better preserved face (with a thickness of 2.9mm &ndash; 3.6mm) has a gentle convexity across both its length and width, with no blade facet evident. The face has the suggestion of parallel or near parallel ribs, now worn and corroded. The surface is heavily-corroded but there is a distinct black patina, possibly tenorite surviving over much of the external surface. Otherwise, the surface has corroded pale-green. 

The fragmentary condition of the axe, lacking the mouth makes typological identification uncertain. The general form, dimensions and ribbed decoration of the axe are all consistent with South Wales (Stogursey) Type axes of Ewart Park metalworking, c. 950 &ndash; 750BC. The heavily-patinated, possible tenorite deposits on the axe are of interest, possibly indicating a deliberate black colouring of the axe[1].

1019154,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1350,-1000,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze dirk with a Group IV blade of uncertain sub-type and of Penard metalworking industry dated to c. 1350 – 1000BC 



The dirk is incomplete missing the tip and with peripheral damage and is fragmentary, now in three fragments (with a combined surviving length of 186mm and a weight of 70.7g) in addition to the separate bronze rivet. The top edge of the butt is straight and has broken around one of the rivet holes (with a surviving width of 23.6mm and a thickness of 2.0mm). The surviving rivet hole is countersunk and circular (with a diameter of 5.7mm and a minimum distance between the rivet holes of 20.9mm) and an arc of approximately one-third from the damaged perforation is evident. The shoulders of the butt are eroded and damaged, now of uncertain form, one side is near-vertical and moderately straight, the other has the suggestion of widening before narrowing to the blade (with a maximum surviving width of 48.8mm where the butt has a thickness of 2.6mm), perhaps suggesting a butt of trapezoidal form. The top of the flattened midrib is evident at the base of butt, widest at its apex (at 34mm). The top of the midrib corresponds with a possible hilt mark, which appears straight and horizontal. There is also a straight horizontal mark on the opposite face but higher on the butt (14mm below the top edge, as opposed to 27mm). Both blade edges have been lost to erosion making the original form of the dirk uncertain. The flattened midrib is discernible along all of the surviving length and is widest at the top of the blade with straight convergent sides, becoming a narrow rib above the tip. The dirk reaches its maximum thickness (of 4.8mm) at its approximate mid-point, near the upper part of the central fragment. There is no decoration on the dirk. Striations are evident on the surface; there are deep vertical striations at the top of the butt, probably preserved from the finishing. Less prominent striations are evident running along the blade edge from sharpening. The surface has a dark-brown patina, with bright-green corrosion on damaged areas.



The rivet is near-ncomplete (with a length of 14.4mm and a weight of 1.7g), missing one end and has a slight bend. The surviving head is of sub-oval form (7.2mm x 6.3mm) and the shaft is of near-square section (4mm square) but with faceted corners. The surface has a dark-green patina



The erosion to the edges of the butt and blade makes typological identification uncertain, however the straight top edge of the butt, the two rivet holes, perhaps notched and the flattened mid-rib on the blade may suggest a Group IV blade, as defined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p. 62-112)[1]. The suggestion of a trapezoidal butt form, may suggest the butt was of ‘Archaic type’. Group IV blades are of Penard metalworking industry dated to c. 1350 – 1000BC

1019156,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-700,"Bronze Age blade, from a sword or rapier of Middle to Late Bronze Age date, c. 1300 – 700BC



The blade is incomplete and fragmentary, now in three conjoining fragments (with a combined surviving length of 418mm and weights of 146.7g, 130.3g and 15.0g (292g combined)). The upper fragment has broken through a central rivet hole (of 3.6mm diameter, now 7mm from the damaged hilt top). The blade is thickest (at 10.0mm) across its hilt and appears to have been of rounded, sub-rectangular section. The hilt has lost both sides and therefore the ricasso and beginning of the blade are not evident. On one face there is a clear change of patination from a green-brown dull patina to a dark-brown ‘glossy’ patina. The difference is straight with an apparent step towards the blade edge and may represent a hilt mark. The variable patina is not evident on the other face. The blade is of lenticular section, with a rounded midsection but with a clear blade facet, where it survives on one short section (20mm long, 144mm below the top, where the blade has a width of 27mm and a thickness of 8.6mm). The blade form cannot be determined because of the loss of the blade edges on both sides but there is the impression that the sword narrows before widening again and perhaps, tentatively suggesting a leaf-shaped blade profile. The blade appears to be narrowing towards the lower section and may have been approaching the tip. Despite the considerable peripheral damage to the blade, much of the surface is well-preserved with sharpening striations evident, mostly running along the blade but also diagonally off the blade. There are no grooves evident along the blade. The hilt has deeper short grooves below the patina. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of brown surface loss and powdery, pale-green corrosion. 



The extensive peripheral erosion has removed nearly all the diagnostic features, making typological identification difficult. The comparatively substantial and thick blade would suggest a sword rather than a rapier. Additionally, the surviving rivet hole would further suggest a sword, the earliest sword types which have central rivet holes through the hilt are of Balintober Type, of Middle Bronze Age date and Penard metalworking, c. 1300 – 1150BC but the hilt arrangement continues through the Late Bronze Age, of Wilburton and Ewart Park metalworking, and is also present on Gündligen Swords of Earliest Iron Age date and Llyn Fawr metalworking (c. 800 – 600BC). The majority of swords recovered in both Wales and Britain are of Ewart Park Type (c. 950 – 800BC) and the surviving features are consistent with the type. The extent of the erosion and damage may suggest that the sword was complete when deposited.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,292,,,10,418,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Merthyr Tydfil,Merthyr Tydfil,Bedlinog,SO1002,,51.70948966,-3.30395997,NMGW-49B5F1,,2017104new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017104new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126317.jpg
1019157,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1000,"Bronze Age bronze axehead, blade fragment probably from a Developed axe, cast flanged axe or palstave of Early to Late Bronze Age date, probably c. 1700 – 1000BC



The axehead is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 47.5mm and a weight of 98.0g). The break has occurred in antiquity and the axe is of sub-rectangular section at the break (with a width of 34mm and a thickness of 11.1mm). The sides are somewhat straight and divergent (for 20mm) before flaring outwards to the blade tips to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 52.4mm). Any casting seams on the sides are no longer evident, probably masked by corrosion and surface loss. The original blade edge has been lost and the blade edge is now asymmetric, differentially worn on one side and has a comparatively deep curve.  The blade faces appear moderately flat before converging to the edge, with a possible subtle blade facet (16mm from the edge). There is a prominent mid-ridge evident on both faces but more noticeable on the better preserved face. It is possible that the mid-ridge may be the distal end of a midrib but may also have had a consistent ridge along the length of the blade. The surface is partially preserved on one face with a dark-green to brown patina and has been lost on the other. There are a number of scratches or striations on the area of preserved surface and appear to be beneath the patina. 



The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification difficult, the central blade ridge suggests an axe of Developed Type or palstave blade, suggesting a the axe belonged to Arreton tradition at the earliest, dated from c. 1700BC to and probably through to Wilburton at the latest, c. 1000BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,98,,,11.1,47.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Caerphilly,Caerphilly,Darran Valley,SO1105,,51.7366159,-3.29025869,NMGW-49DA31,,2017150new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017150new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126318.jpg

The cast spearhead is incomplete, missing the base of the socket and the basal parts of both blades (with a surviving length of 103.3mm and a weight, including sediment in the socket of 78.0g).  At the break the spearhead is sub-circular sectioned (with a maximum diameter of 16.4mm) and the internal socket is sub-circular to oval (10mm x 11.5mm). The socket is considerably thicker on one side (5.0mm thick compared to 0.8mm) causing a weakness in the socket wall and probably resulting in the break. There is no evidence that the socket has broken through perforations for attachment. The damaged blades are present at the break across the socket (giving a surviving width of 19.5mm). The blades are largely damaged and truncated, surviving on one side (with a length of 51.6mm and a thickness of 1.6mm) and has a moderate convex curve to the tip. The blade edge is evident over short areas but has largely been lost. The socket is conical, gradually narrowing to the tip (where it has a diameter of 3mm). Striations are evident where the surface survives, running along the socket and adjacent blade. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a dark-brown patina and some patches of green corrosion.



The fragmentary condition of the spearhead where the diagnostic features have been lost, makes typological identification indeterminate. Socketed spearheads begin in Arreton phase towards the end of The Early Bronze Age and continue to the Ewart Park Phase of the Late Bronze Age. The form of the spearhead probably suggests that it is unlikely to be from the types found in the Arreton phase and is likely to date from Acton Park to Ewart Park, dated to c. 1550 – 800BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,78,,,16.4,103.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Willersley and Winforton,SO3147,,52.11699475,-3.00911745,NMGW-5B950C,,201943.jpg,bronze age socketed spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/201943.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126435.jpg

The palstave is near-complete, with minor damage to the blade edge and some surface loss (with an overall length of 166mm and a weight of 361.8g). The butt (with a width of 22.8mm and a thickness of 3.2mm) is straight and perpendicular to the sides. The sides are straight and slightly widening to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 32.4mm, where the stops have a height of 24.5mm) before prominent side mouldings or ‘nicked sides’ (giving a width of 36.5mm). The sides are gently curved along the blade, before flaring out to the blade tips, producing an  expanded and rounded blade edge, slightly damaged at the blade tips (with a blade width of 77.1mm and a blade depth of 22mm). The casting seams are barely evident on both sides and have been neatly finished, particularly on the sides of the blade. The flanges rise from the beneath the butt (17mm beneath) and have a gentle curve reaching their apexes above the stop (20mm above where the flanges have a height of 34.6mm and a thickness of 24.4mm at the stop). The septum is near-straight and slightly rounded across its width (33mm long and 18 – 19mm wide). The stops have a slight curve across their widths, are vertical sided (with a stop height of 8.4mm - 8.8mm and are raised above the faces (with a height of 4mm-5mm and a thickness of 5mm). A single rib extends from the stop on each blade face (for a length of 44mm and 49mm). The faces are slightly hollowed each side of the rib to suggest raised blade edges. There is a subtle rounded blade facet evident on both faces (19mm - 20mm from the blade edge). No obvious sharpening striations are discernible on the blade. The surface has begun to laminate at the blade edge and is damaged on one flange, otherwise the surface has a mid to dark-red brown patina.  



The palstave is of Early Midribbed Type and its broad form with subtle ‘flange extensions’ and prominent nicked sides, all indicate Type Chepstow, which corresponds to Acton Park metalworking and can be dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.

The spearhead is fragmentary, represented by the top end but with the tip missing and has broken in antiquity (with a surviving length of 55.5mm and a weight of 42.3g). The spearhead has broken through the central circular socket (with an internal diameter of 11.1mm and a surviving depth of 19.6mm). The position of the socket is marked by a prominent, rounded midrib (with a width of 11mm, a height of 3mm and giving a maximum surrounding overall depth of 12.0mm). The midrib gradually narrows as it approaches the tip (with a width of 7mm at the break) but retains its height. The blade edges are lost but the surviving edges suggest they may have been straight and gradually convergent to the tip, producing a triangular form to the upper part of the spearhead. If the straight blade edge continued to the tip, some 49mm of the tip have been lost. The spear is solid at the upper break (with socket terminating 33mm below the break and with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 8.6mm). The blade edges had prominent facets, preserved over much of the blade. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running along the blade, partially preserved on both faces.  The surface is has a dark-green patina, possibly with tin surface enrichment in areas.

1019257,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-800,"A fragment of cast copper alloy spearhead of Middle to Late Bronze Age date (1400- 800 BC). The spearhead is broadly triangular in shape with both long edges and the tip well preserved. A strong narrow mid-rib is present terminating near the tip. The mid-rib does not divide the fragment evenly suggesting that the blades had been sharpened on a regular basis with one edge being worn away more than the other. Blade bevels on both long edges are present. The break is patinated suggesting that it is due to old damage rather than something more recent in the burial environment. It is possible that the break was a deliberate one prior to deposition when the weapon was ‘decommissioned’. This is more likely as the depositional landscape is dominated with streams and drained / improved wetland fields with poor drainage (further indicated by the iron staining from soil mineralisation / panning present on the lower blade). The blade is a mid-green colour with a well formed surface patina. A direct parallel and date cannot be attributed due to the undiagnostic nature of the fragment. It is most likely to be later Middle Bronze Age (1400-1150 BC) in form due to its strong lozenge sectioned.

1019373,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze tanged chisel, known as a trunnion tool, probably dating from 1500BC to 800BC



The trunnion tool is near-complete, heavily corroded with peripheral erosion (with a length of 164mm and a weight of 119.4g). The butt is narrow, thin and rounded (with a width of 9mm and a thickness of 3.9mm). The sides are straight and gradually divergent to the two trunnions. The chisel is thickest at the position of the trunnions (63mm  - 78mm from the butt, where it has a maximum thickness of 10.3mm). The trunnions are now of rounded form (giving a maximum width to the tool of 33.1mm, protruding by 2-4mm and are 15mm wide). The sides of the blade are also straight and divergent towards the blade edge, now eroded (with a surviving width of 21.5mm). The blade edge has been lost and the edge is damaged, longer on one side. One face of the tool is more convex across its length than the other and both faces are flat across their widths, becoming gently convex along the blade. The surface of the tool has largely been lost, with a pale, bright-green corrosion underlying a grey-brown corroded surface. There is one surviving patch of dark brown patina surviving on one face near the position of the trunnions. 



Trunnion tools are a long-lived form of chisel spanning from the Arreton tradition at the end of the Early Bronze Age (1700-1500BC) to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800BC) (Brailsford 1953, 34, Fig. 12[1]; Burgess & Cowen 1972, 169-74[2]). A number of trunnion tools have been recovered from along the northern Marches and in north-east Wales. Examples have been found in the Broxton (Cheshire), Ebnal (Shropshire) and the Meol Brace (Shropshire) hoards. The former was associated with two Group III low-flanged palstaves and a basal-looped spearhead dated to the Taunton period of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1275BC) (Davey & Forster 1975 Cat. 66[3],; Longley 1987, 96-103[4]).  The latter, associated with two transitional palstaves of the Penard phase. A rich hoard from Burton, Wrexham contained two palstaves of Transitional type along with a number of gold ornaments dating to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. (Gwilt, Lodwick & Davis 2004)[5]. Single finds of trunnion tools have also been made at Talerddig (Powys), Llandudno (Conwy) (Hemp 1925)[6] and Llangynog (Carmarthenshire)[7]. While some trunnion tools can date from the end of the early Bronze Age, most associated examples are recovered from hoards dated to the Middle Bronze Age.

1019383,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1800,"Early Bronze Age bronze butt fragment from an axe of uncertain type but of Flat or Developed Axe form 



The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end in antiquity (with a surviving length of 50.2mm and a weight of 51.0g). The butt end is evenly rounded (with a width of 20mm and a thickness of 0.9mm). The sides are straight and divergent for their lengths to the break (where the axe has a width of 28.0mm and a thickness of 8.6mm).  The axe butt has a near-rectangular body section, with one face flatter across its width than the other. There is no suggestion of flanges present on the fragment. The corroded surface is heavily-pitted with a dark-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion and surface loss. . The surface condition and patina suggest a bronze rather than copper composition, although it has not been possible to analyse the composition. 



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult and uncertain. The slender, rounded butt form, absence of flanges and the presumed bronze composition would be consistent with axes of Needham’s type 3 and in relation to Schmidt and Burgess (1981)[1] typology may have been of Migdale, Aylesford or allied types. Axes of these types are likely to be date to the Early Bronze Age, perhaps between c. 2200 – 1800BC.

1019391,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe, probably of South Wales (Stogursey) Type and of Ewart Park metalworking, dated to Needham’s (1997) Period 7, c. 950 – 750BC



The socketed axe is fragmentary, missing the upper part of the axe and the loop (with a surviving length of 58.3mm and a weight of 76.9g). The break occurred in antiquity and does not appear to have been the result of an evident weakness (at the break the axe has dimensions of 33mm x 23mm and with a maximum surviving socket depth of 43.6mm). One of the faces has impacted damage, forcing the face into the socket and possibly suggests deliberate damage. The other face has a crack extending from the break down the face (for 14mm).  The more complete side has the stub from the lower attachment of the loop. Beneath the loop the side is moderately straight, before flaring slightly to the gently expanded blade edge (giving a blade width of 39.00mm), slightly truncated. The blade edge has a shallow curve (with a depth of 9mm). The sides of the axe are bevelled towards the centre, where the casting seam is evident but has been neatly finished. The faces appear to have been moderately flat across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the blade edge. The faces were probably decorated with three convergent ribs and additionally sides of the faces appear to have been enhanced with ribbed mouldings. Deep striations are evident on the better preserved face, running diagonally from the blade edge and extending to the break. The striations appear to be beneath the patina and are too extensive to be sharpening striations. The surface is corroded and pitted with a dark-green patina and patches of bright-green corrosion.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,76.9,,,43.6,58.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llanarth,SO3721,,51.88398433,-2.91671538,NMGW-C33C2D,,20171562new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/20171562new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126919.jpg
1019419,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Early to Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group I, Primary Shield Pattern type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981)[1] and of Acton Park metalworking Industry corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 4 and probably dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC



The palstave is near-complete, with some damage to the flanges (with an overall length of 138.3mm and a weight of 361.8g). The butt (with a width of 23.2mm and a thickness of 4.8mm) is near-straight lower at the centre. The sides are straight and near-parallel to a point below the stop (with a width at the stop of 15.8mm, where the stops have a height of 24.0mm and the flanges have a height of 27.9mm). The sides have a linear divergence along the blade, before flaring out to the blade tips, producing a moderately expanded and rounded blade edge (with a blade width of 55.0mm and a blade depth of 18mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly finished but there is no ridged or ‘nicked’ sides evident. The flanges rise from the butt and would have had a straight top edge but are now damaged, giving the suggestion of a rounded lozenge form to the sides of the axe.  The flanges reached their maximum heights just above the stop (16mm above the stop and with a maximum surviving height of 32.8mm). The septum is gently rounded across its width but near-perpendicular to the flanges and stops (with a maximum flange heights of 13.1mm and a stop height of 7.8mm - 8.6mm). The stops have a slight curve across their widths and both stops extend above the faces (with a height of 4.2mm and a thickness of 5mm - 6mm).Because of a hollowing at the top of the blade the flanges have the impression of extending onto the faces. Both faces have hollowing beneath the stop, although appearing rounded, related to a ‘shield’ form on one face and more squared on the other. There is the suggestion of a weak midrib on one face, through the shield-shaped hollowing and extending onto the blade (with a length of 36mm). No rib is discernible on the other face. There is a clear rounded blade facet on both faces (20mm from the blade edge). The surface is heavily-pitted with much of the original surface lost and with a dark-brown patina. The surface is magnetic, suggesting deposition within iron rich deposits, possibly boggy. 



The palstave is of an early form and has a depression below the stop rather than a shield moulding. The suggestion of a subtle midrib may indicate similarities to ‘Early Midribbed palstaves’. Primary Shield Pattern and Early Midribbed palstaves are likely to both be of Acton Park metalworking, dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.

1019424,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-900,"Late Bronze Age socketed spearhead of uncertain type, possibly pegged or side-looped, probably of Wilburton Metalworking, dated to c. 1200 – 900BC



The cast spearhead is fragmentary, missing the basal end and was comparatively large (with a surviving length of 141.0mm and a weight of 75.8g). The blade appears to have been of lozenge of kite-shaped form and has broken on one side near its base and on the other side near its widest point. The socket interior is evident at the break (with a maximum surviving depth of 114.6mm, ending 35mm from the tip) and there is also a blade edge facet discernible, suggesting the blade has broken at its start. There is no suggestion of a loop-hole, suggesting the spearhead was not of a Basal Looped type. The blade edge appears to widen with a linear edge (for 43mm, where the spearhead has a maximum surviving width of 42.5mm), the blade edge then has a near-linear convergence to the tip. The socket position is marked by the circular-sectioned midrib on the faces (with a thickness at the break of 1.0mm and a maximum depth through the midrib of 12.6mm), which gradually narrows and thins towards the tip. The blade wings thin slightly towards the edge (with a maximum thickness at the midrib of 5.0mm and a thickness before the edge facet of 3.4mm).  The stepped blade bevel or blade facet is preserved along much of the surviving blade edge (with a maximum width of 5.7mm). Some of the damage to the blade edge may be contemporary with its use but much of the edge, particularly the shorter side is more recently damaged. The surface is somewhat pitted and corroded with a dark-brown patina. Linear striations running along the blade wings are preserved beneath the patina. There is a bend just above the widest point of the blade but a loss of patina and green corrosion at the bend may suggest that the damage occurred more recently.



The absence of the socket makes typological identification uncertain and the lozenge or kite-shaped blade form is also a little unusual. The more commonly–recovered types consistent with the form of the fragmentary spearhead are pegged, of Davis’ generic Group 11 (2015)[1], or possibly of a side-looped type, Davis’ (ibid) Group 6, although the blade would seem to be too large for a Group 6 spearhead. Socketed Spearheads of Davis’ Generic Group 11 can be dated to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated by Needham et al (1996)[2] to c. 1200 – 900BC.

1019427,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-11500,-600,"Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe fragment of indeterminate type and of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries dated to c. 1,150 – 600BC



The fragmentary cast axe is represented by a blade fragment only (with a surviving length of 25.4mm, a maximum thickness of 11.5mm and a weight of 42.6g). At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket, now worn and corroded but probably of sub-rectangular form (29mm wide and with a maximum surviving depth of 2mm). Little of the either side of the axe survives (with a maximum surviving length of 18mm) but the short length are straight and divergent (producing a blade width of 44.9mm and a width of 40.8mm at the break). The blade edge is not expanded and has a gentle curve. (7.1mm deep).  The surviving blade face fragments are convex across their widths and near-straight across their short surviving lengths with no evidence for ribs present on the fragment. The surface is pitted with a corroded dark-brown patina and areas of green corrosion. There are probable casting flaws at the break, which are likely to have weakened the axe.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base would imply a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork. The unexpanded and shallow blade form is consistent with Ewart Park axes of South Wales and similar types.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,42.6,,,11.5,25.4,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llanarth,SO3910,,51.78531859,-2.88571887,NMGW-C4D532,,2017183new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017183new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126968.jpg
1019435,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axehead, probably of Ewart Park Metalworking and of Needham’s Period 7 



The cast socketed axe is incomplete, broken in antiquity and is missing the upper part of the body, including the mouth and loop (with a surviving length of 45.5mm and a weight of 51.0g). The axe body is of sub-rectangular section at the break (with dimensions 28.9mm x 16.4mm). The socket is oval sectioned (22.3mm x 12.8mm and 8.5mm deep). The wall thickness is variable, considerably thicker on the sides (at 2.6mm) compared to the faces (at 0.9mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel, before expanding sharply to the slightly recurved blade tips (giving a blade width of 38.9mm) and producing a curved blade edge. The casting seams are evident on both sides but have ben neatly fettled. There are no discernible ribs on the either face. There is a point impact depression immediately below the break on one face and a rounded indent at the break on the other face. Both faces are moderately straight and convergent before converging more sharply at the blade but with no obvious blade facet. The surface is pitted and corroded with a dark-green patina. 



The missing mouth makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively small size of the axe suggests that it is not of South Wales type but the form is consistent with axes of Ewart Park metalworking, dated to c. 1000 – 750BC.



The axe was reported with the socketed containing sediment which was removed at AC-NMW. At the base of the socket was loose organic fibrous deposits, possibly the remains of the wooden haft.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,51,,,,45.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llantilio Crossenny,SO4014,,51.82138675,-2.87191739,NMGW-C52206,,2017291new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017291new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1126979.jpg
1019477,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Bronze Age bronze Early Short-Flanged axe, possibly of Type Bannockburn as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.76-7)[1] but of Acton Park 1 metalworking industry, straddling the end of the Early Bronze Age to beginning of the Middle Bronze Age; c. 1600 – 1400BC



The axe is complete with minimal corrosion and is comparatively large (with a length of 184mm and a weight of 678.7g). The butt is straight (with a width of 16.2mm and a thickness of 2.3mm) and is slightly angled across its width. The sides are straight and gently divergent as far as the ‘nicked’ ridges, below the stop (with a width at the stop of 32.9mm, a width of 35.8mm above the nicks and a width of 40.0mm across the nicks). Below the nicked ridges, the sides are concave and divergent to produce a splayed blade edge (with a blade width of 81.7mm). The blade edge has an even rounded curve. The casting seams are barely discernible and have been neatly and carefully finished. Beneath the nicks on the sides of the blade are decorative hammer facets.  The flanges are comparatively low, beginning at the butt and reaching their zenith just above the stop (with a maximum height of 25.2mm and a maximum height above the septum of 8.9mm) and continue onto the blade, ending at the position of the nicked ridges. The flanges are angled or bevelled inwards and converge slightly on the blade to incorporate the shield-pattern moulding. One of the flanges has an additional facet near its top edge not evident on the other three flanges. The septum (16mm long and 9mm wide) is flat and is near-perpendicular to the flanges and stop. There are hammered recesses and transverse ridges across the septum on both faces, immediately above the stop. The bar ledge stop is vertical (with a maximum height of 11.4mm above the septum and 7.3mm above the blade and is 3.3mm thick) and in side view, projects slightly above the flanges. The shield decoration is formed by a raised moulding and extends from the base of the flanges (with a length from the stop of 52mm). The blade is rectangular sectioned but the faces are gently convex across their widths. The blade faces are also convex across their lengths and convergent with no discernible blade facets. The blade appears to be more finished than are area within the shield, which shows hammer marks and casting flaws. Neither hammering facets nor sharpening striations are evident on the blade. The unpatinated surface has some pitting and some small patches of pale-green corrosion. 



The axe is of interesting form and should perhaps be considered as transitional between flanged axes and early palstaves. The long and low flanges extending into the shield pattern moulding, the faceted flanges and hammer-decoration on the nicked-sides are all features common to flanged axes. The axe form can be paralleled in an example recorded by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 77, pl. 55, no. 431) as Type Bannockburn. The prominent bar ledge stop however perhaps relates to primitive shield palstaves. Needham (1996, p 133)[2] and others have argued that there is considerable overlap for ‘final EBA and earliest MBA’ types and this axe form would appear to relate to this overlap of types.

The spearhead is near-complete missing one loop and with some damage to the socket mouth (with a length of 94.0mm and a weight of 39.2g). The incomplete socket is sub-circular (with a maximum internal diameter of 13.5mm and an external diameter of 14.5mm - 15.9mm). The socket has a depth of 30, possibly with concretions or corrosion at the base. There is a subtle groove around the socket above the mouth (3mm above the socket). The sides of the socket are near-straight and gradually convergent. One of the loops is complete 



and is flat-topped of linear form (20mm long by 3mm wide), which begin 20mm from the socket mouth. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval (4.0-5mm long and 2mm high). Both sides have a ridge, running between the mouth and the base of the loop. Between the top of the loop and the base of the blade are five to six short horizontal incised lines, perhaps referencing or accommodating the binding. Only a small part of the blade survives (with a surviving length of 18.6mm and maximum surviving width of 45.6mm) but the gentle curve may suggest a leaf-shaped blade. The damaged blade edge with a blade facet is evident and survives on one side. Above the loop, the socket becomes increasingly oval-sectioned and defines a prominent midrib along the blade, as far as the break (with a thickness at the break of 9.5mm). The break occurred in antiquity and the socket (4.9mm diameter) is off-centre at the break (with a minimum thickness of 0.4mm). The spearhead has been neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is partially-preserved with a dark brown patina. Sharpening striations are evident beneath the patina running along the blade on the better preserved face. 





Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. A side-looped spearhead of Davis’ (2012) Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London[4], and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31)[5] to 1680 – 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 – 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (Davis

The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval (5.5mm long and 2.8mm high). There is a weak ridge on both sides running from the loop to the blade, giving the top of the socket a sub-lozenge section. Only a small part of the blade survives (with a surviving length of 88mm and maximum surviving width of 5mm) but the slender convergent form may suggest a flame-shaped blade. No detail survives on the small fragment of surviving blade edge. The tip is missing and is likely to have broken in antiquity. The spearhead has been neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is partially-preserved but with the surface now flaking and with a mid to dark brown patina. 



Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. A side-looped spearhead of Davis’ (2012) Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London[4], and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31)[5] to 1680 – 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 – 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (Davis 2012, ibid. p 7). Most Group 6 spearheads however are likely to date from Acton Park and Taunton industries. Damage to the spearhead makes typological identification uncertain but the comparatively long and slender form with a suggested flame-shaped blade may suggest a Group 6C spearhead, which have a largely South-Eastern British distribution.

1019677,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper alloy Socketed Spearhead with side loops of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1150 BC). The object has a leaf-shaped blade and is sub-circular in cross section with a central rib running down to the blade and extending into the shaft and socket. All edges of the blade have portions missing due to breaks and abrasion and there is a transverse break approximately half way down the length of the blade. The socket is circular and hollow and tapers in from the base to the blade. There are two loops on opposing sides of the socketed end, in line with the casting seams. These loops are slightly flattened on the outside to make them appear lozenge shaped. There is a break across the mid-section of the socket and loops. 



Length: 122.64mm, Width (socket): 13.34mm, Width (blade tip): 4.57mm, Thickness: 10.02mm, Weight: 32.1g



The metal is dark green in colour with areas of light green corrosion. The object has a predominantly smooth patina. 



A similar spearhead is illustrated by C. N. Moore and M. Rowlands (1972) in the Salisbury Museum Bronze Age metalwork catalogue (plate XI, no. 57) and recorded as Greenwell and Brewis Class IV. 



Similar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (1500 - 1150 BC).This object is therefore likely to be of a similar date.

1019766,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,600,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of indeterminate type probably of Ewart Park metalworking Industry, dated to c. 950 &ndash; 750BC but possibly of Wilburton-Wallington through to Llyn Fawr Industries, dating to c. 1,150 &ndash; 600BC

The axe head is fragmentary missing the upper part and is represented by approximately half of the original (with a maximum surviving length of 61.4mm and a weight (containing sediment) of 111.9g). The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 42.8mm and 13.2mm respectively). The axe is likely to have had a sub-rectangular section at the break but both faces are now dished as a result of battering the socket from both faces. The battering appears to have occurred at the base of the socket, although this cannot be demonstrated because of the sediment within the socket. The surviving part of the side is straight and near-parallel before diverging gently to a slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 47.9mm). The sides of the axe are rounded across their thickness with the casting seam evident running along the centre and neatly finished. The blade edge is comparatively straight, rounded near the tips. Both faces are dished beneath the break and suggest considerable force was applied; one face has a linear indentation from the more complete side, while the other face has a rounded depression. Beneath the break on one face is the base of a decorative rib, suggesting three parallel or near-parallel ribs. No ribs are now discernible on the other face. Beneath the impact damage on the blade, the faces are slightly convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facet evident. The surface is damaged and torn around the impact area but has mid &lsquo;olive&rsquo; green patina surviving elsewhere. 

The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 &ndash; 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form and ribbed decoration are likely to suggest Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC) and possibly of South Wales or allied axe type. The damage to the axe is deliberate, perhaps as an attempt to close the socket, as seen on other axes with deliberate damage.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,11.9,,,13.2,61.4,1,,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Peterston-super-Ely,ST0877,,51.4844426,-3.32633314,NMGW-076CC1,,20161251.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20161251.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127641.jpg
1019776,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1850,"Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe, probably of Needham’s Class 4 and probably relating to axes of later Class 3 or earlier Class 4. 



The axehead is complete with a broadly lenticular profile but with subtle bevels and is comparatively small (with a length of 91.2mm and a weight of 152.4g). The thin butt has a gentle curve (with a width of 19.5mm and a thickness of 2.0mm). One side is near-straight, slightly convex and diverging gently towards the bade (with a width at the top of the blade of 29.5mm), before diverging sharply to the recurved blade edge (with a blade width of 44.0mm). The other side has a noticeable bulge below the butt, giving the axe an asymmetric appearance. The blade edge was crescentic, now asymmetric, perhaps slightly eroded or worn on one side. The sides are convex across their thicknesses’ but without faceting and without a practical flange, although there appears to be a lip or low flange from the side-working. Although the faces give the axe a lenticular long profile, two curving bevels present: the median bevel is subtle and is positioned comparatively low on the axe (54mm from the butt and where the axe has a maximum thickness of 11.9mm). A more pronounced blade facet is evident (23mm from the blade edge). There are irregular incised marks on the blade, below the patina but unlikely to sharpening striations. The surface has a dark-green patina with some bright green damage on one face. 



The presence of a subtle median bevel, blade facet and ‘lip’ flanges all suggest early developed features, probably indicating an axe early in the sequence of class 4 or the last of Class 3 axes of the Mile Cross Assemblage. The dimensions and ratios do not correlate directly with Needham’s subtypes, although are perhaps closest to 3G, Type Knapton but do not closely confirm to the type. The form broadly corresponds with Type Aylesford, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess’s (1981, p. 60)[1] as a ‘primitive’ developed flat axe. The form would suggest a date at the earlier part of Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, probably dating to c. 2050 – 1850BC.

1019906,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze fragment, possibly of Bronze Age date but of uncertain artefact type



The fragment has broken on one end (with a surviving length of 47.2mm and a weight of 29.0g) and the other end is of irregular sub-rectangular section (13mm x 7mm) and is corroded and heavily-pitted. The sides of the terminal are straight and near-parallel as far as a stop (17mm from the terminal where it has a width and thickness of 15.0mm and 9.0mm respectively. Above the stop the sides are straight but more divergent to the break (with a width and thickness of 18.8mm and 7.0mm respectively). The septum is longer on one face (with a surviving length of 20mm and 24mm, a thickness at the break of 1.8mm and a maximum width of 12.5mm) and the side flanges end in a rounded stop. The stop is comparatively shallow on both faces (at 1.5mm). The surface is heavily-corroded with a dark-green patina preserved on the septum. 



The object has the flange and stop features in common with palstave axe types, generally of Middle Bronze Age date. It is possible that the terminal is incomplete and originally ended with a blade, perhaps suggesting a chisel or similar. If the end is relatively intact, it may be possible to suggest a small hammer that may have been hafted in a similar form to Middle Bronze Age palstaves and therefore earlier than socketed hammers. However flanged hammers of this form are difficult to parallel.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,29,,,9,47.2,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Longtown,SO3430,,51.96454255,-2.9620237,NMGW-56BFDE,,2017232new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017232new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127853.jpg
1019940,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-750,"Bronze Age blade fragment of uncertain type, probably from a rapier or sword of Middle to Late Bronze Age date c. 1500 – 750BC.



The blade is fragmentary, represented by a slender fragment, broken at both ends in antiquity (with a surviving length of 31.9mm and a weight of 18.1g). The blade has no clearly defined midrib and is of lenticular section of consistent thickness (of 5.8mm – 6.3mm). The blade is comparatively slender and both original blade edges have been lost. The blade edges were straight and convergent to one end (with a maximum surviving blade width of 20.4mm and minimum width of 17.8mm). The short blade fragment has a gentle curve across its length, with the suggestion of bending prior to breaking. The surface is very heavily-corroded and much of the original surface with a dark grey-green patina over red-brown areas of surface loss.



The fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively slender form of the blade may suggest that it’s derived from just above the tip of a sword although a rapier fragment is also possible. Rapiers date from the Middle Bronze Age while leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,18.1,,,6.3,31.9,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Cardiff,Cardiff,Pentyrch,ST0979,,51.50258281,-3.31245204,NMGW-587A08,,201738new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/201738new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127908.jpg
1019944,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1150,-600,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe mouth fragment of uncertain type and of Wilburton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries of c. 1150 – 600BC date



The axe is represented by a mouth fragment from the top of one face only (with a surviving length of 17.1mm, a surviving width of 30.8mm and a weight of 7.3g). There is a rounded protrusion on the top of the mouth where the mouth is also thicker (at 5.0mm, compared to 3.9mm), possibly the remnants of a casting runner stub, which has been well-finished. One end of the mouth has a slight curve and is likely to be approaching the axe side. The mouth has a lip above a moulding (9mm long), below which the tops of two ribs are evident immediately above the break. The axe is likely to have had three ribs originally. The lip at the mouth is also present on the inside of the socket but no other features are evident inside the socket.  The surface is heavily-pitted with a dark-brown patina. 



The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. Axes of Ewart Park tradition are more commonly recovered.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.3,,,3.9,17.1,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Steeple Ashton,ST2956,,51.29867918,-3.01975314,NMGW-58A358,,2017391new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017391new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1127913.jpg
1019964,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1900,-1600,"Early Bronze Age developed flat axe of Needham’s Class 4 but of uncertain sub-type, probably dating to Willerby assemblage (Metalworking Assemblage V), the later part of Needham’s (1996)[1] Period 3 to c. 1900 – 1600BC



The axehead is near-complete but has lost all of its surface, except at the blade edge and is a comparatively small axe (with a length of 80.5mm and a weight of 101.8g). The axe is likely to have had a lozengic long profile but the surface loss has eradicated any median bevel. The butt (with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 1.7mm) is straight and angled to one side. The sides are straight and near-parallel, gently divergent, before diverging more sharply at the blade (52mm from the butt, where the axe body has a width of 25.5mm). The blade is now asymmetric, differentially worn or corroded on one side. The blade edge is moderately expanded, producing a curved blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 38.2mm). The flanges appear to have begun just below the butt and probably reached their maximum heights around the midpoint of the axe (with a surviving maximum depth of 11.3mm and a height of 2.1mm), which was likely to have corresponded with the median bevel. The sides are convex across their thicknesses and there is the suggestion of a central ridge. The flanges are likely to have been hammered, rather than cast. The faces are now gently convex across their lengths, with no surviving evidence for a median bevel or for blade facets. The blades also have a gentle convexity across their widths. The surface survives near the blade edge with a dark-brown green patina. Sharpening striations running along the blade are discernible on one face. Elsewhere the surface has been lost and has corroded bright-green. 



The loss of surface detail makes typological identification difficult. The low flanges indicate a developed form and the straight butt and straight, near-parallel sides, only more divergent at the blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 65-8)[2], furthermore, its comparatively small size would seemingly indicate the variant Swinton.

1019969,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Bronze Age bronze early palstave or Early Short-Flanged axe, sharing features with Bar-Stop axes (Stegbeile) as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.89-90)[1] and of Acton Park 1 metalworking industry, straddling the end of the Early Bronze Age to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age; c. 1600 – 1400BC



The axe is near-complete but is heavily-corroded (with a length of 144.5mm and a weight of 321.7g). The butt appears slightly eroded and is of irregular shape (with a width of 20.4mm and a thickness of 4.5mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the top of the blade, to a point just below where the flanges end (where the axe has a width of 26.4mm). There is no suggestion that there was a side loop but there is the suggestion of possible nicking on the sides where the flanges end, although corrosion has removed any detail. Below the flanges the sides diverge more sharply to produce an expanded blade with a crescentic blade edge (51.3mm wide), damaged on one side. The sides are flat across their thicknesses. The flanges are truncated through corrosion or damage and begin just beneath the butt, rising with a gradual curve to reach a maximum height above the stop (with a maximum surviving height of 23.5mm). The flanges appear comparatively thin (at 2.5mm – 3.7mm thick) and are perpendicular to the septum.  The septum is flat across its length and has a gentle concavity across its width (with a thickness of 6.5mm, a length of 57mm and a width of 16mm – 18mm). The ledge stop is perpendicular to the septum (with a height of 11.0mm) and has a slight concavity across its width. There is a casting flaw at the base of the stop on one face. On one face, the stop projects above the blade faces, highest at the centre (5.1mm high) but near level to the blade at the sides and giving the impression of the stop being detached from the flanges. The stop on the other face (with the flaw) is less raised above the face and here the flanges are more damaged, making any distinction poorly defined. There is no shield pattern or midrib now evident below the stop, there is however the suggestion of a D-shaped depression at the top of the blade and it is possible to tentatively suggest an enclosing moulding, where the surface is better preserved on one face. The blade faces are subtly convex across both their lengths and widths with no discernible blade facets but giving a near-rectangular body section. There is a curved ridge evident on both faces (19mm from the blade edge) and is likely to define the position of a blade facet, now lost to corrosion.  The original surface has largely been lost but with occasional surviving remnants of dark-brown patina over the pitted, pale-green surface.



The axe appears to be somewhat transitional between flanged axes and early palstaves. The prominent bar ledge stop relates to ‘primitive’ palstaves, perhaps of Shield Pattern type, if the suggested shield-pattern decoration is correct. The separation between the stop and flanges, perhaps relates to Early Short Flanged axes and the suggested nicked sides would also be an early feature. The loss of more subtle details of the axe makes precise typological identification difficult. Needham (1996, p 133)[2] and others have argued that there is considerable overlap for ‘final EBA and earliest MBA’ types and this axe form would appear to relate to this overlap.

1019976,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"Copper alloy blade fragment, probably a Bronze Age reworked blade, possibly of Middle Bronze Age date



The weapon is fragmentary, represented by the lower part of the hilt and the top of the blade (with a surviving length of 67.1mm and a weight of 11.9g). The hilt has broken through a rivet-hole, positioned off-centre (with a diameter of 4.2mm). The hilt has a lenticular section at the break (2.0mm thick at the break and 3.2mm thick at the shoulders), becoming lozengic at the shoulders. The sides of the hilt are moderately straight and diverge slightly towards the shoulders (with a width at the break of 12.6m and 15.0mm above the shoulders) and both sides appear to have been blunted (with a thickness of 1.3mm). The shoulders are expanded (where the blade has a maximum width and thickness of 16.9mm and 3.4mm respectively). Below the shoulders, the blade narrows sharply to produce a rapier type blade profile (with a width and thickness at the break of 6.0mm and 1.6mm respectively). The top of the blade has a defined mid-ridge, with the suggestion of a flat-topped ridge near the break. The original blade edge has been lost and it is now uncertain whether any of the damage relates to its contemporary use.  A curve at the break indicates that the blade was bent prior to breaking. The surface has surviving remnants of a mid-brown patina over a darker-brown corrosion



The comparatively long hilt with central rivet placement does not correspond with typical wide and trapezoidal butted dirks and rapiers, usually secured with side rivets or notches. The blade width is also unusually slender. The fragmentary condition of the weapon makes a definitive identification problematic, however it is possible to suggest that the weapon was reworked from an earlier blade.

1020012,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of Ewart Park Metalworking Industry, dated to c. 950 &ndash; 750BC

The axehead is complete and is a comparatively small example (with a length of 62.6mm and a weight of 86.6g, including sediment in the socket). The mouth is oval (33.0mm wide and 27.4mm deep external and 23.8mm x 17.8mm internal). The top of the mouth has a lip-ridge from casting and appears to have been a four-runner casting, now with two stubs evident. The collar is rounded and bevelled to the face. The loop springs from the base of the moulding and is of rounded, sub-lozenge section (with a length of 21mm, 9.0mm internal, 4.8mm wide and 4.3mm thick). The sides are moderately straight and near-parallel (with a width below the loop of 28.2mm) before diverging sharply to produce an expanded and curved blade edge (with a width of 37.6mm). Both sides have a clear ridge from the casting seam, which has been neatly finished. The casting seam on the unlooped side is notably flattened opposite the loop, perhaps from the binding. The blade edge has some post depositional damage. Both faces are decorated the three converging ribs, with the side ribs beginning at the corners of the faces. The faces are convex across their widths and also have a gentle convexity across their lengths, before converging sharply below a blade facet (19mm from the blade edge). The body of the axe has a rounded, sub-rectangular section. Sharpening striations are evident on both on faces, running along the blade. The surface is corroded with a patchy dark-brown patina over a mid-brown surface.

The ribbed socketed axehead with no moulding beneath the collar and probable four-runner casting is likely to indicate an axe allied to the South Wales (Stogursey) type. However, the axe is considerably smaller than would be expected and also has a rounded body section with a blade facet and recurved blade, which are all features atypical of the type.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,86.6,,,27.4,62.6,1,,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Pont-y-Clun,ST0681,,51.52006907,-3.35619487,NMGW-5AB6F2,,20161491.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20161491.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1128016.jpg

The leaf-shaped blade is truncated and heavily-corroded (with a surviving length of 47.9mm and a weight of 6.1g). The butt is evenly-rounded, giving the blade a maximum width at the base of the blade of 18.9mm). There are small rounded indents beneath the start of the blade edge, possibly remnants of rivet notches to secure the handle. The butt is thinned (with a minimum thickness of 0.8mm) and reaches its maximum thickness (of 2.5mm) near the midpoint of the blade. The butt is flat across its width, while the blade appears to have had a rounded central ridge. The original blade edge and tip have been lost. The surface is very-heavily pitted and has a pale to mid-green patina.



Metallurgical analysis was undertaken[1] using X-Ray fluorescence, which demonstrated the alloy is a tin-bronze with trace elements of iron, lead, zinc and arsenic detected.

1020257,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1600,1450,"Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group I, Primary Shield Pattern type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981)[1] and of Acton Park 1 metalworking Industry corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 4 and probably dated to c. 1600 – 1450BC



The palstave is near-complete, with some damage to the blade edge (with a length of 145.9mm and a weight of 475.5g). The butt is moderately straight and undulates slightly (with a width of 24.5mm and a thickness of 3.1mm). The flanges end just below the butt and rise to their highest point above the stop (with a maximum depth of 36.6mm and a maximum height above the septum of 14.5mm). The flanges have a slightly convex profile across their widths. The septum is concave across its width and the stop is of bar ledge form and is near-straight (with a maximum height above the septum of 12.5mm and 14.4mm). The sides of the palstave are straight and near-parallel, slightly divergent as far as the stop (with a width of 30.4mm), below which, they gradually become more divergent before expanding sharply to the splayed and recurved blade tips, now slightly damaged(producing a blade width of 62.0mm). There are subtle transverse ridges or ‘nicks’ on the sides below the stop (where the blade has a width of 32.2mm). The blade edge is asymmetric, partly through wear but with some damage at the centre. The casting seams are discernible but appear to have been carefully removed and finished on both sides. The flanges extend onto the top of the faces, flanking a central hollowing below the stop. The hollowing is coarse and unfinished but has a broadly ‘shield-pattern’ form. The axe faces are flat across their widths and their lengths before converging more sharply below a blade facet (17mm from the blade edge). The blade edge is corroded, with no surviving evidence for sharpening striations. One of the blade faces has striations running up the blade evident above the facet but beneath the patina, possibly finishing marks. The surface has a mid to dark-brown patina, largely preserved but damaged at the blade.





The palstave demonstrates the characteristics of Primary Shield Pattern palstaves, but has a shallow depression rather than a moulding for the shield-pattern. This example with the recurved blade edge, slender body and of a smaller size the many Acton Park type examples, would suggest Type Colchester as defined by Schmidt & Burgess, (1981, p. 117).

The axe head is fragmentary missing its upper part and is represented by approximately half of the original (with a maximum surviving length of 56.6mm and a weight (containing sediment) of 143.6g). The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 42.3mm and 22.3mm respectively). The axe has a sub-rectangular section at the break and is of variable wall thickness (1.8mm – 4.3mm).  The surviving parts of the sides are straight and near-parallel before diverging gently to a slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 48.3mm). The sides of the axe are rounded across their thickness with the raised casting seam evident running along the centre and finished. The blade edge has a gentle curve, rounded near the tips. There is the suggestion of a central rib on the more complete face. The faces are slightly convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facets evident. Both faces have deep striations running diagonally along the entire surviving lengths beneath the patina. The surface has dark-green patina surviving elsewhere. 





The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The form is consistent with socketed axes of Late Bronze Age date, c. 1,150 – 600BC of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. However, the form and suggested ribbed decoration are likely to suggest Ewart Park metalworking industry (c. 950-750BC) and possibly of South Wales or allied axe type.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,143.6,,,22.3,56.6,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Goetre Fawr,SO3205,,51.73956157,-2.98620223,NMGW-9B610B,,2016183.jpg,Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2016183.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1128787.jpg
1020400,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age bronze blade fragment from an axe of indeterminate type, probably of Early or Middle Bronze Age date



The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade end only and has broken across its width in addition to its length (with a surviving width of 51.1mm, a surviving length of 31.5mm, a maximum surviving thickness of 10.7mm and a weight of 73.0g). The break occurred in antiquity and there is no socket base evident on the sub-rectangular body section. The surviving side fragment is convex, widening to the blade tip, now truncated but indicating an expanded blade edge. The original blade edge has been lost but the current edge suggests a moderate curve (with a depth of approximately 14mm). The side is widest at the edges, possibly as a result of hammering. The blade faces have a slight convexity across both their widths and lengths but with no obvious blade facet. The original surface has been lost and the current surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-green to brown patina.



The fragment condition of the axe makes typological identification uncertain.

The tip is rounded and worn and a central, raised midrib runs vertically down the middle of both sides of the blade. There is a worn break at the base with knicks and worn areas on both edges of the blade. The fragment has lost all its diagnostic features and so the classification cannot be further refined.

1020432,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Copper tanged gouge of uncertain date possibly Bronze Age 



The cast tanged gouge is complete (with a length of 86.2mm and a weight of 24.7g). The tang is pointed at its apex ad below is square to rectangular sectioned, with straight sides gradually diverging towards the blade (reaching a maximum thickness of 5.6mm at the top of the blade, where the gouge has a width of 9.8mm). The sides of the blade are also straight and diverge more markedly to the blade edge. There are no lugs or mouldings on the sides. The blade edge is straight (with a width of 23.4mm and, a depth of 4.2mm). The flute gradually both deepens and widens along the blade (with a length of 37mm). The surface is heavily-corroded and is stripped to the red-brown metal with traces of pale to dark-green patina. 



Metallurgical analysis was conducted on the gouge using X-Ray Fluorescence and suggested that the metal composition is largely copper. 



The gouge is of an unusual form and cannot easily be paralleled in Bronze Age metalwork. Gouges generally are of socketed form and date to the Late Bronze Age. Very few tanged gouges are recorded, with one of the few instances in the Carlton Rode (Norwich) hoard[1] of Ewart Park metalworking, although the examples are of significantly different form, being slender and collared. Tanged chisels are easier to parallel and also date to the Late Bronze Age but also generally have a collar or side lugs. Simple ‘chisels’ of similar form have been recovered, including the ‘axe-chisel’ from Llandyfan (Anglesey) associated with an Early Bronze Age Food Vessel urn (Savory 1980, no. 334)[2]. The suggested copper composition would be very unusual for Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts and if Bronze Age, a Late Bronze Age date may be expected for the gouge. Therefore it is perhaps unlikely that the gouge dates to the Bronze Age but cannot be discounted.

1020460,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe probably of Needham’s Class 3 axes but of uncertain subtype



The axehead is incomplete, missing the butt end and with some truncation to the blade tips and edge (with a surviving length of 93.6mm and a weight of 199.2g). The axe is rectangular-sectioned (with a width and thickness at the break of 28mm x 10.0mm), with no suggestion of hammered flanges or developed edge features on the intact areas of the edges. The sides are straight and divergent before expanding more sharply to the blade tips, now damaged and truncated (with a surviving width of 69.1mm). The original blade edge has been lost (with a minimum thickness at the blade edge of 3.2mm) and the current edge is comparatively straight with a shallow profile, although the original edge was likely to have been deeper and with at least a moderate curve. The blade faces are flat across their widths and the blade becomes more convergent but there is no discernible facet and there is no median bevel evident. Hammering marks are evident on the blade and there is the suggestion of a blade facet (7mm deep from the current blade edge) with sharpening striations running along the blade facet. Large areas of the surface survive with a dark-green to brown patina, elsewhere the surface has a pale-green corrosion. 



Metallurgical analysis was conducted on the axehead using X-Ray Fluorescence and suggested that the metal composition is a leaded bronze. 



The fragmentary and truncated condition of the axe makes detailed typological identification uncertain. The lack of any developed features but the bronze composition would suggest a Needham Class 3 axe and generally perhaps corresponds to the Migdale type as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981)[1] of Metalworking Assemblage III and dated to c. 2200 – 1900BC.

1020461,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of (Class B) Southern English ribbed type and of Ewart Park metalworking, dated to Needham’s (1996)[1] Period 7, c. 950 – 750BC



The socketed axe is fragmentary, missing the mouth and one face (with a surviving maximum length of 104.0mm and a weight of 234.0g) and was damaged in antiquity. The more complete face is likely to have broken just below the mouth but with no mouth moulding surviving. The socket has a moderately consistent rectangular profile (29mm x 19mm and with a surviving depth of 67.5mm). The longer side has the stub of the loop surviving just below the break (with a surviving height of 9.0mm). The sides are near-straight, gently convex and divergent before a moderate out-turning at the blade tips (giving a blade width of 54.3mm). The sides are perpendicular to the faces and straight across their thickness. The casting seams are discernible and were finished but the detail has been removed through corrosion. The blade edge has a slight curvature with some damage. The faces are gradually convergent with no blade facets and have a shallow convexity across their length and are near-flat across their widths, producing a rectangular body section (with a maximum surviving body width, below the loop of 38mm). The faces were decorated with vertical parallel ribs and the more complete face appears to have had 6 ribs, with the two outermost ribs following the edges of the face. Striations are evident running between the ribs.  The surface has a dark-brown patina partially preserved, with pale-green corrosion elsewhere.





The missing mouth makes any typological identification uncertain, the form and size of the axe would suggest the axe type to be a Southern English ribbed axe, which Needham (1990, p 32)[2] called Class B and if the axe also had a double-mouth moulding may have been similar to his B1 axe but with a less expanded blade edge. Southern English ribbed axes are not commonly recovered from South Wales and together with occasional Carp’s Tongue components in Ewart Park hoards, perhaps begin to suggest a degree of contact between western and South Eastern Britain at the start of the 1st millennium BC, which may be observed proportionately less in South Eastern Wales.

The axe is represented by one corner of the blade (with a surviving length of 20.0mm, a surviving blade width of 28.8mm and a weight of 13.1g). The axe has broken in antiquity, at a position just above the base of the socket (with a surviving depth of 6mm, where the axe has a thickness of 9.9mm, the faces have a thickness of 2.8mm and the side if 5.5mm thick). A small length of the side survives, which is flat across its thickness with a raised but hammer-finished casting seam running down the centre. The blade tip is prominent and out-turned. The blade edge has a moderate curve for its surviving length. The blade edge has impact damage (5mm long), probably contemporary with is use or breakage, adjacent to the break.

The axehead has been damaged and is incomplete missing its mouth and loop (with a maximum surviving length of 88.9mm and a weight of 232.8g). The break across the axe occurred in antiquity (where the axe had a maximum surviving width and thickness of 43.0mm and 27.6mm respectively, a surviving socket depth of 60.9mm; a face thickness of 2mm – 3mm and a side thickness of 3mm – 5mm) and has a sub-rectangular section at the break, with a stub on one side, presumably from the loop. One face and part of the side have been hammered inwards, over the socket and suggests deliberate contemporary damage. The sides are near-straight parallel before diverging more sharply to an expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 55.0mm). The sides of the axe are bevelled towards their centre, where the raised casting seam is evident running along the centre. The casting seam has been neatly hammer-finished. The blade edge has a moderate and even curve. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, with the central rib slightly more pronounced. The faces are convex across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the edge, with no blade facets evident. One face has recent damage scars.

The flat axe is incomplete with considerable peripheral damage surface loss and likely truncation at the butt (with a surviving length of 89.7mm and weight of 121.98g).  Although damaged the axe appears to have a lozengic long-profile. The original butt does not survive (but with a surviving width of 15mm). The better preserved side is unusually straight for its preserved length (of 43mm) and is bevelled towards its mid-axis.  There is the suggestion that the side may be beginning to curve outwards before the surface has been lost. The side of blade faces have a slight lip for the flange and corresponding hammer facets are discernible on the sides.  The original blade edge has been lost (with a surviving blade width of 35.8mm) and the original form is no longer evident. Both blade faces have a clear median bevel, which has a gentle curve and is positioned close to the damaged butt end (32mm from the butt where the axe has a maximum thickness of 12.0mm and a surviving width of 25.3mm), producing a lozengic long-profile. The blade faces have a gentle convexity across their both their widths and lengths, with no discernible blade facet. There are striations running along the blade near its end, suggesting only a slight loss to edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of powdery grey-green corrosion. 



The unknown scale of truncation to the axe, particularly the butt makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively high position of the median bevel would suggest that the butt end may be significantly eroded. If the current very narrow and straight-sided form of the axe, is representative or near-representative of its original shape, then the axe would perhaps suggest a Class 4 axe-chisel. The axe may possibly be of similar form to Developed Axes of Type Bandon, as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 65-7)[1] and if correct may correlate to Needham’s Class 4E. The axe is likely to date to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 3, dated to c. 2050 – 1700BC.

1020801,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1800,"Early Bronze Age bronze butt fragment from an axe of uncertain type but of Flat or Developed Axe form 



The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end in antiquity (with a surviving length of 28.1mm and a weight of 23.1g). The butt end is rounded at the corners and is moderately straight (with a width of 25mm and a thickness of 2.7mm). The sides are straight and divergent for their short lengths to the break (where the axe has a width of 30.5mm and a thickness of 6.0mm).  The axe butt has a sub-rectangular body section, thickest at the centre and with no suggestion of flanges present on the fragment. The corroded surface has been stripped to brown metal with remnants of the mid-green. The surface condition and patina may suggest a copper rather than bronze composition, although it has not been possible to analyse the composition. 



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult and uncertain. The butt form, absence of flanges and possible copper composition would be consistent with axes of Needham’s type 1 and in relation to Schmidt and Burgess (1981)[1] typology may have been of Ballybeg /Roseisle or allied types. Axes of these types are likely to be date to the Early Bronze Age, perhaps between c. 2200 – 1800BC.

The socketed axe is incomplete, missing the upper part of one face and side and the loop and is comparatively small (with a length of 52.6mm and a weight of 56.9g). The mouth is incomplete, with a little less than half surviving and appears to have been sub-rectangular (with surviving external dimensions of 33.0mm x 24.5mm and internal 22.6mm x 14mm, with socket depth of 40.0mm). The surviving part of the top of the mouth is irregular and two of the probable four casting runners are evident. There is a slight lip discernible at the mouth, above the rounded mouth moulding (with a length of 6mm and a depth of 4mm - 6mm). The loop springs from the moulding, just above the break and the stub of the lower return is evident (giving a loop length of 18.6mm). The sides of the axe are moderately straight, before diverging to the slightly expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 33.2mm). The blade edge is largely straight (with a depth of 4.4mm) with minimal expansion. The sides of the axe are bevelled towards the centre, where the casting seam is evident but has been neatly finished. The faces appear to have been flat across both their lengths and widths and gradually convergent to the blade edge. Both faces display evidence of damage from battering, possibly deliberately and the battering on the fragmentary face is likely to have removed its upper part. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, convergent on the complete face and near-parallel on the incomplete face but with irregularly placed.

The axehead is near-complete, missing the loop (with an overall length of 107.5mm and a weight of 436.0g, including some sediment in the socket). The flat-topped mouth is sub-oval (56.8mm x 50.3mm) with a sub oval socket (36.9mm x 32.4mm and with a maximum depth, containing sediment of 41mm). Three of the four casting runner stubs are evident on the face but have been carefully removed. The mouth moulding has a prominent lip on most of one face but the other face has the usual bevelled-steeped moulding. The sub-circular loop (with a length of 37mm) springs from the moulding on one side and has broken just above the moulding. Both breaks on the loop appear to be recent. The sides have a gentle concavity long their lengths and are bevelled to the centre across their thicknesses. The casting seams are clearly discernible but have been neatly finished. The sides diverge to the gently expanded blade edge (with a width of 58.0mm), which has a very gently curvature. The original blade edge has been lost. Both faces are decorated with three parallel ribs, which descend from the moulding and continue for most of the faces (with a length of 66mm). Additionally the edges of the faces are raised, suggesting further ribs. The faces are otherwise gently convex across their widths and near straight across their length, before converging more sharply at the blade, below the ribs but with no blade facet. Hammer facets are discernible on both blades. The surface has a dark-green patina and traces of probable tenorite survive on the upper part of the faces and along the length of both sides. 



There are crude incised marks on both blades, lying beneath the patina and seemingly deliberate, the marks generally extend from the ribs, including the sides and end before the blade edge. There are addition incised marks running across the blades crossing the verticals. Some of the marks are doubled in areas, suggesting a secondary attempt on the same alignment and implying a deliberate design was attempted. A number of sharpening striations are also evident running both along and perpendicular to the blade edge.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,436,,,,107.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South West,Gloucestershire,Forest of Dean,St. Briavels,SO5505,,51.74188522,-2.65313695,NMGW-1D56C4,,2017110new.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/2017110new.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1130095.jpg
1020916,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age bronze butt fragment from an axe of uncertain type but of Developed Axe or Palstave form 



The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end (with a surviving length of 15.6mm and a weight of 8.4g). The butt end is comparatively straight with some damage and thins to a blunt edge (with a width of 19.0mm and a thickness of 1.5mm). The sides are straight and slightly divergent for their short lengths to the break (with a maximum width of 24.4mm and a thickness of 4.7mm). The sides are rounded and convex across their thicknesses with the suggestion of a finished casting seam on the corroded and pitted surface. The flanges begin just below the butt and are just emerging before the break (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 7.2mm with a height above the septum of 1.3mm). The break occurred in antiquity. The surface has a dark-green patina with patches of pitting and corrosion. 





The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with slender-butted Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981) from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,8.4,,,4.7,15.6,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Fyfield and Tubney,SP4100,,51.69725659,-1.40818013,NMGW-2E8EC1,,2015111.jpg,Bronze Age Palstave or developed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2015111.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1130025.jpg
1021081,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group III, Low Flanged, Broad Blade form and possibly of Sleaford variant type, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p136) [1].



The palstave is near-complete, missing much of the loop the butt-end and a blade tip and is a small example (with a surviving length of 106.5mm and a weight of 173.1g). The butt is damaged (18.5mm wide and 3.7mm thick), now pointed at the centre but is unlikely to have been much longer. The sides are straight and near parallel to below the stop (where the axe has a width of 19.9mm below the loop). The sides of the blade are divergent with a moderate curve before diverging more sharply to the blade tips, one of which is lost (giving a surviving blade width of 42.1mm). The blade edge has a moderately deep curve (with a blade depth of 15mm). The sides are flat across their thickness with the casting seam clearly evident but neatly finished. The loop is damaged (with a length of 18.8mm, a maximum thickness of 6mm and a surviving height of 5.6mm) and positioned near the position of the stop. The flanges are truncated but appear to have begun at or below the butt and have a linear top edge, reaching their maximum height at the stop (where the axe has a thickness of 25.6mm). The septum (with a surviving length of 39.5mm, a width of 14mm and a thickness of 5.5mm) is flat across its length and gently concave across its width. The stop is also gently concave with near vertical sides (with a height of 10.4mm). The faces are bevelled from the top of the stop to the face and are decorated with three ribs, a prominent linear central rib, flanked by weaker side ribs, curving from the edge of the sides towards the central rib before petering out by the mid blade face. The curved converging ribs perhaps suggest a trident variant design. The central rib extends all the way along the blade, reaching the prominent blade facet (12.6mm long). The original surface with a dark-brown patina has been lost over much of the surface and is fragile with a tendency to flake. 



The palstave is of unusual form, particularly in relation to its small size but also with the curving ribs. The form may be best paralleled in Low-Flanged palstaves, perhaps a variant of Type Sleaford, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p136). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1500 – 1150BC.

1021087,Wedge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,,,"Lead axe-shaped wedge, possibly a miniature votive axe of uncertain date, possibly Bronze Age to Roman



The axe-shaped object has been hammer-shaped and is complete (with a length of 28.7mm and weight of 8.1g). The butt is thickened and of rectangular section (8.4mm wide and 5.2mm thick). The sides are straight and divergent before flaring to the expanded blade edge (with a blade width of 16.6mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The faces are somewhat irregular but generally flat and gradually convergent from the butt to the blade. There is no applied decoration to the object.



The wedge-shaped piece of lead has few diagnostic features, making any identification speculative and uncertain. The expanded blade edge is similar to axes of Bronze Age and later date, however a rectangular-sectioned block, hammered at one end would produce a similar ‘blade’ profile. The thickened squared butt is best paralleled in shaft-hole axes of Iron Age and later date but there is no suggestion of attempts to represent a shaft-hole. While miniature votive axes are recorded, these generally are of copper alloy and often represent socketed axe forms. Copper alloy shaft-hole axes are known, generally of Roman date but often include the handle in the representation.",,4,Lead,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,8.1,,,,28.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llancarfan,ST0773,,51.44832263,-3.33967676,NMGW-81C2E4,,miniature.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/miniature.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1130390.jpg
1021201,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 8.8 mm (thickness: 2.5 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (5.6 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 19.7 mm (thickness 2.0 mm).



It measures 48.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 19.7 mm, width at the butt is 8.8 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 5.6 mm. It weighs 18.5 grams.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

The palstave is near-complete but heavily corroded and eroded at the edges (with a length of 124.2mm and a weight of 245.4g).  The butt (with a width of 24.6mm and a thickness of 4.8mm) is damaged and its original form uncertain. The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the position of the stop (where the axe has a width of 27.2mm and a thickness of 18.1mm). The sides of the blade have an even and gradual curve to the now damaged and eroded blade tips (with a maximum surviving blade width of 49.4mm). The sides are corroded and no transverse ribs, or ‘nicked-sides’ are evident.  The original blade edge has been lost but suggests a moderately deep curve (with a depth of 17mm). The flanges are truncated but appear to have low, beginning from beneath the butt and reaching their maximum heights (with a surviving height of 17.4mm and a maximum height above the septum of 5.5mm) above the stop. The septum is straight and flat across both its length and width and has a few small casting flaws. The stops are vertically sided and slightly concave (with a height of 5.5mm). Corrosion has removed much of the surface detail on the blade faces but there were depressions below the stops, suggestive of the shield-pattern. It is also possible to suggest a midrib, indicating a trident design. The blade faces have a gentle convexity across their widths and are straight but gradually convergent across their lengths, with no obvious blade facet surviving. The original surface has largely been lost with remnants of a dark-brown patina and elsewhere is pale brown with patches of pale green corrosion. 



The corroded surface has removed much of the diagnostic detail but the palstave appears to be of an early form, with a depression below the stop rather than a shield moulding. The suggestion of a subtle midrib may indicate similarities to ‘Early Midribbed palstaves’. Primary Shield Pattern and Early Midribbed palstaves are likely to both be of Acton Park metalworking, dated to c. 1600 – 1400BC.

The axe comprises a worn blade fragment (with a surviving length of 39.7mm and a weight of 63.6g). The break has occurs in antiquity across the thickest surviving part of the axe (where the axe has a width of 27mm and a thickness of 7.3mm). The sides are worn and corroded but appear to have been straight and divergent but widening more sharply at the blade. The blade tips have been lost (giving the blade a surviving width of 40.8mm). Both blade faces are gently convex across their width and flat across their lengths, before narrowing more sharply at a poorly defined blade facet. The original blade edge has been lost but now has a comparatively deep curve. The surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-green patina with areas of bright-green active corrosion. 





The fragmentary state of the object makes any definite identification difficult and typological identification more problematic. The general form, with a lack of developed features and straight, divergent sides are broadly consistent with Type Migdale axes, dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2200 – 1900BC). Metallurgical Analysis was undertaken by Mary Davis[3], with three readings taken from a micro-sample and analysed by Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy; minor and trace element analysis is included; although possibly inaccurate, particularly when below 0.1%, but give an indication of presence and absence, which researchers are finding significant for analyses of Early Bronze Age material. The results indicate a tin-bronze with significant trace elements of zinc and lead. The measured percentage results are:

1021611,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-750,-600,"Copper alloy fragment, probably a blade edge fragment from a Bronze Age axe of undetermined type and date but possibly a fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe



The axe is fragmentary, represented by a side fragment of a blade edge only (with a surviving width of 17.1mm, a surviving length of 25.5mm, a maximum surviving may possibly have broken across the base of a socket, possibly suggested by a depression on the break. Only a very short part of the blade edge survives (7mm). The casting seam is evident on the surviving side, with the suggestion that the sides are angled to the centre. The side is slightly convex across its surviving length. Both face are slightly convex across their lengths with no discernible blade facet or ribs surviving. The surface is corroded with some surviving dark green patina.





The fragmentary state of the object makes identification difficult and typological identification indeterminate. Although it is possible to tentatively suggest the base of a socket on the fragment and together with angled sides, indicating a hexagonal body section may indicate a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date, c. 750 – 600BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,,,,,25.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9775,,51.4645671,-3.48411224,NMGW-155FEB,,2015512.jpg,Bronze age axehead fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2015512.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1131695.jpg
1022059,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete copper alloy facetted socketed axehead dating to 1000BC- 800BC. Flanking both faces of the axe is a wide, flat based channel that emanates from the tips of the blade.  Running the length of the axe, each channel gently expanding to the rear collar and gives the axe an overall hexagonal cross-section. Further decoration can be found on both sides where six transverse grooved lines are positioned before the collar. The Collar is undecorated and gently curves out at its base to form an expanded flanged terminal. 



On the side of the axe is a loop that is made from a rectangular arched band that has two channels running its length.  These loops are normally positioned to run lengthways down the axe; however, this example has the loop positioned transversely across the axe. 



The position of the loop in very uncommon, but this is one other example recorded on this database, see DOR-3F8141.","

1022391,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-750,"Late Bronze Age bronze ‘Late’ Palstave of Type Isleham as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 158-163)[1], dated to late Wilburton or Ewart Park metalworking industries (ibid.) and dated to perhaps 1100 – 750BC



The palstave is near-complete, with some peripheral damage to the flanges (with a length of 136.6mm, and a weight of 304.1g). The butt is straight and like the septum, is thick (with a width of 19.6mm and a thickness of 6.5mm). The sides are straight and gently divergent as far as the stop (where it has a width of 25.1mm). The loop begins before the stop and continues on to the side of the blade (with a length of 26.0mm, a width of 8.8mm, a height of 9.1mm and giving an overall width of 29.7mm). The palstave narrows slightly to the blade (at 19.5mm), after which the sides are gradually divergent and produce a slightly expanded blade edge, with some damage and loss to the blade tips (with a blade edge width of 33.6mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished but are more-finished and barely discernible on the sides of the blade. The flanges rise from well below the butt (13mm) and rise linearly to reach their maximum depth (of 31.1mm) at the stop.  The stop is comparatively straight and is perpendicular to the septum (with a height of 9.6mm). The thick septum is enhanced on both faces with three parallel ribs, beginning at the stop and ending before the flanges start (with a length of 34mm). Both blade faces are decorated with three short, parallel ribs (19.1mm long) beginning beneath the stop. The stop is raised above the blade (3.2mm high) with a near-perpendicular bevel to the blade faces. The blade faces are straight and convergent, before converging more sharply to the blade edge but with a subtle but discernible blade facet. Hammer facets are evident on the blade and occasional striations, possibly from sharpening. The surface has a mid to dark green and black patina with areas of bright green corrosion. 



The palstave has many of the characteristic attributes of ‘Late’ palstaves and the ribbed blade decoration with nipped-in waist under the stop, suggests Type Isleham. The continuation of the ribs on the septum is an unusual feature and is difficult to parallel. The ribbed septum would have helped to eliminate rotational movement when hafted.

1022521,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-600,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe mouth fragment of undetermined type and probably of Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries, c. 1000 –600BC



The axe is fragmentary, represented by a mouth and upper face and side fragment (with a surviving length of 27.1mm, a surviving width of 23.5mm, a surviving depth of 8mm and a weight of 13.5g) with all of the breaks occurring in antiquity. The mouth is rounded (6.5mm thick and 8mm long) with no casting runner stubs present on the mouth.  Beneath the collar is a horizontal moulding on the mouth and side. The face (with a thickness of 4mm) has the top of two of the three ribs descending from the moulding and continuing to the break. The face is flat across its width and its length, beneath the collar. The side has a slight angle, perhaps suggesting a hexagonal body section on the axe. There is no evidence for a loop on the side. The socket is flat across both its length and width.  





The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The horizontal moulding beneath the collar indicates that the axe was not of South Wales Type but may be of Type Welby, Type Yorkshire or other similar types of Ewart Park metalworking but also may possibly of Sompting or allied types of Llyn Fawr metalworking.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,13.5,,,8,27.1,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Wenvoe,ST1373,,51.44927745,-3.25335867,NMGW-3D42CC,,20151043.jpg,Bronze age socketed axe fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20151043.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1134177.jpg
1022532,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"Middle Bronze Age bronze socketed spearhead of Davis’ (2012)[1] Group 6: Developed side-looped, unclassified (Greenwell and Brewis (1909)[2] Class IV (or socket -looped)) spearheads and of later Arreton, Acton Park, Taunton or early Wilburton metalworking (c. 1500 – 1100BC), of Needham’s (1996)[3] Periods 4-5



The spearhead is incomplete missing both most of blade and the socket mouth (with a surviving length of 70.2mm and a weight of 28.5g). The socket was circular, with a small fragment of the simple rim surviving (with a maximum surviving internal diameter of 14.0mm and an external diameter of 16.7mm). The socket continues to the break across the blade. The sides of the socket are near-straight and gradually convergent. One of the loops is complete and is flat-topped of linear form (20mm long by 3mm wide), which begin 20mm from the socket mouth. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval (4.0-5mm long and 2mm high). Both sides have a ridge, running between the mouth and the base of the loop. Between the top of the loop and the base of the blade are five to six short horizontal incised lines, perhaps referencing or accommodating the binding. Only a small part of the blade survives (with a surviving length of 18.6mm and maximum surviving width of 45.6mm) but the gentle curve may suggest a leaf-shaped blade. The damaged blade edge with a blade facet is evident and survives on one side. Above the loop, the socket becomes increasingly oval-sectioned and defines a prominent midrib along the blade, as far as the break (with a thickness at the break of 9.5mm). The break occurred in antiquity and the socket (4.9mm diameter) is off-centre at the break (with a minimum thickness of 0.4mm). The spearhead has been neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is partially-preserved with a dark brown patina. Sharpening striations are evident beneath the patina running along the blade on the better preserved face. 





Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. A side-looped spearhead of Davis’ (2012) Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London[4], and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31)[5] to 1680 – 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 – 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (Davis 2012, ibid. p 7). Most Group 6 spearheads however are likely to date from Acton Park and Taunton industries.

1022877,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-1050,"A complete Bronze Age cast copper-alloy spearhead of basal-looped triangular form, 106.35mm in length. The blade is triangular, with a pair of small loops at the junction between the lower blade edge and the socket. The root of the blade juts out at right angles from these loops. The socket is conical, continuing along the blade as a broad rib with circular cross section, with the flat blade projecting to either side. There are possibly small ribs running along the blade from the ends of the loops which are aligned with the midrib, however the condition of the object makes these very difficult to see clearly. The patina is dark, with pale patches of corrosion / encrustation typical of long exposure to a riverine environment. This spearhead is likely to date from circa 1200 to 1050 BC.","The style can potentially be identified as Davis Type 9c (also identifiable as Greenwell and Brewis IIIa) and is seen as an indigenous development from earlier leaf-shaped Middle Bronze Age forms which is associated with the Penard industry. This dates to the transition from the middle to late Bronze Age. This is a relatively rare tradition, with finds typically concentrated in the lower Thames Valley (Pearce, 1984: 41; Ehrenberg, 1977: 11), as with this example, which was a foreshore find from the Thames and may have originally comprised a votive deposit in the river. Similar examples from the upper Thames valley are published in Ehrenberg (1977: Fig 17) and more generally in Langmaid (1976, 52; 18a/b). This is an unusually small example of the type.

1023130,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,1150,600,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy leaf shaped spearhead, probably of Davis (2017) Group 7, dating from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (1150 BC-600 BC).



The surviving portion is a length of the hollow leaf-shaped blade with tapering edges and a rounded tip. At the opposite end there is one surviving shoulder, which terminates in an uneven worn break, revealing the hollowed interior, which extends right through to the tip. The external edges of the blade are uneven in form and are all worn and rounded, as is the tip. 



On one side the body is significantly damaged with a large portion of the once conical socket compressed and collapsed in several places with several portions missing, revealing the hollow interior within. The junctures between the socket and blade are also cracked in several places along the length of the blade either side of the compressed and collapsed areas.



The opposite face remains intact but is likewise compressed along the central axis of the blade, with subsequent cracking in several areas either side.



The form of the spearhead suggests that it is probably a conical spearhead variant. The shape of the blade resembles the leaf-shaped spearheads of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage (1000-800 BC) and is probably a Davis Group 7 type missing its more diagnostic side-loop and decorative features. Peter Reavill and Dot Boughton note that as it is missing these features, the earliest to which it could date is 1150 BC during the late Penard metalworking phase.

The blade is narrow and triangular with a pronounced, broad mid rib, on both sides extending to the tip of the spear which tapers in to a point. In cross section the object is lozenge shaped. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. There are multiple abrasions and missing portions of the edges. The fragment terminates in an old abraded transverse break. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing and the retained portions has a shallow concave aspect expose by the break.



The metal is a dark-brown in colour with areas of green and light brown corrosion and a pitted and corroded patina.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1500-c. 800 cal BC).

1023946,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"An incomplete cast copper alloy Bronze Age axe (1150 BC-800 BC). The axe is a plain long socketed type and slender in form. 

The axehead has been damaged and is incomplete missing the mouth and the loop (with a surviving length of 72.6mm and weight of 95.13g). The break is from old damage (where the axe has a maximum surviving width of 29.5mm, thickness of 21.1mm and socket depth of 43.1mm) and has a sub-rectangular section at the break with the end of the bottom loop on one side just before the break. The loop end is corroded and is represented by a small raised stub. The sides of the fragment are bevel slightly to the casting seams (which are smooth, probably hammer-finished) each running the length of the blade on the top and bottom. The sides diverge gently before flaring slightly towards the blade edge (with a blade width of 36.6mm). Towards the blade edge (11.5mm from blade edge) a darker gradient possibly indicates usewear. The blade edge itself is damaged with the original surface having been broken/eroded away through time. 

The faces of the blade are plain with no evidence of ribs. The faces are flat and gradually convergent to the blade edge. Sharpening striations are discernible running along the blade edge. The surface is smooth with a medium green patina with areas near the break on one face and on the top side lost to damage, likely from deposition environment, exposing a rough light green subsurface.

1023967,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-700,"An incomplete cast copper alloy spearhead probably of late Bronze Age date (c.1500-700 BC). The spearhead is fragmentary, missing the basal end of the blade and base of the socket with only the top end with tip surviving. The spearhead has broken through the central socket, which is solid, with a diameter of 14.2mm x 12mm). The position of the socket is marked by a prominent, rounded midrib with a width of 12.1 at the break, height of 3.3mm on one side and 4.3 on the other, and maximum surrounding overall depth of 12.2 just before the break. The midrib tapers gradually towards the tip (0.7mm in width and 3.2mm overall depth at the point). Faint lines run parallel to the midrib from the break and appear to terminate c.7.6mm from the point, though they could have run up to the tip and have since been eroded away from surface damage. The surviving blade edges suggest the blade end is triangular in plan and widens just before the break (39.3mm), so was possibly leaf-shaped. The spearhead is slightly bent towards the break (as seen in section) suggesting the object was intentionally bent and broken prior to deposition. One side of the spear has been struck, possibly by plough, with a diagonal groove running from the midrib to the edge of the blade. 



The absence of the socket makes typological identification uncertain. The more commonly–recovered types consistent with the form of the fragmentary spearhead are pegged, of Davis’ generic Group 11 (2015)[1], or possibly of a side-looped type, Davis’ (ibid) Group 6. Socketed Spearheads of Davis’ Generic Group 11 can be dated to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated by Needham et al (1996)[2] to c. 1200 – 900BC.



The spearhead is an uneven grey patina with patches of bright green, dark grey/black possible tenorite, and orangey brown. The object has a max length of 85.3mm, width of 39.3mm, thickness 14.2mm and weighs 48.72g.

This corresponds with the Acton Park II, and Taunton metalworking Assemblages, that correspond with Needham Period 4 or 5. 



The axe has a narrow, convex butt. The septum and upper blade are of the same thickness and there is no stop-ridge present. The flanges are cast and are a wide pointed oval shape in profile, nearly lozenge shaped. The blade has suggestions of a central ridge or arris on both faces. The sides flare out moderately to form the cutting edge which is convex, but the blade is fairly narrow overall when compared with the larger corpus of similar axes.

1024893,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1700,"A copper alloy flat axehead of Needham Class 4, dating to the Early Bronze Age period, c. 1900-1700 BC. 



The axehead is lenticular in profile, with slightly flattened edges, and a broadly flaring cutting edge. It is comparatively small with a markedly slender butt, which nonetheless thickens at the septum. This is possibly a proto-stop ridge, as there is a particular horizontal thickening in this area. Both faces show signs of pitting, with some circular areas a deeper green than the consistently dark green surface elsewhere. There is a shallow U-shaped depression in the cutting edge which may have occurred during use. 



Similar examples, albeit with a slightly longer butt, include SOM-90B762 (from the south west), KENT-A2BA81 and NMGW-084887, the latter of which has slightly more exaggerated bevelling.  DEV-987893 is a further local fragmentary example. The record for SOM-90B762 provides an extended interpretation:



This is a low flanged axe of Early Bronze Age date. The lack of developed stop ridge suggests it most likely dates to the later stages of the Early Bronze Age. Needham (1983, 2017) has produced a typology of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age flat and flanged axeheads that defines them based on the ratios of their physical form (Needham 2017, 4, Table 1). This axe meets all the criteria for a Type 4e Axehead and most closely corresponds to a Type 4E Withington form (Needham, 2017, 27-29, 55-56). Needham places the date of this type of axe to between the 20th and 18th centuries cal BC c. 1900-1700 cal BC (ibid 45, fig 16).

1025204,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1500,1300,"A cast copper alloy (bronze) early / primary looped palstave, group I - shield patterned type - of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1300 BC). This palstave axe fits best within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both of which conform to Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.



The palstave is incomplete (recovered in two pieces); when recombined the overall length of the axehead is approximately 160mm. Width is 66.2mm measured across the blade tips and 22.3mm at the butt-end. The width measured across the upper and lower flanges is approximately 28mm. The casting seams are present on one edge only (loop side), but have been removed / trimmed and hammered flat / flush. The cutting edge is crescentic and relatively unworn; the blade bevels are well formed and the tips of the blade show little sign of wear or resharpening. On the upper blade on both the front and reverse faces is a cast / moulded shield-shape pattern. A cast central mid-rib is present that divides the shield evenly in half - it descends from the mid-point of the stop and tapers to an indistinct terminal on the lower blade. The arris also features for a short distance in the centre of the septum where it meets the stops. The loop is relatively small and low; it bisects the stop being broken on the upper / butt side. The two slide flanges are well cast and conjoin with the stop forming a single entity on both edges. In section this is H shaped. The septum is smooth and undecorated. The butt is rectangular and is incomplete; a small fragment of the butt-end is missing; it is most likely lost due to an old patinated casting defect at this point. The axehead has a thick mid-green brown coloured patina which covers all surfaces. There are areas where this is lost a pitted light green coloured corrosion product is present. 



As stated the axehead is in two pieces, having broken transversely across the butt-side of the stops, through the H-section the septum forms with the flanges, and on through the loop. A failure at this location could easily have occurred in use, particularly because the haft termination and sudden reduction of the load bearing cross-section at this point would concentrate the stresses locally. Metallurgically the fracture surface is granular and brittle and although detail is vague could well have contained a casting defect, the propagation of which during use may have caused a fatigue failure;- so explaining the lack of any plastic deformation. An excess of tin in the alloy would also make the axehead overly brittle and prone to failure of this kind. Alternatively given the nature of the landscape in which the axehead was found, it may have been intentionally destroyed in a ritual votive fashion. Bronze Age material is often discovered votively broken, but otherwise well preserved, in deposits close to water around the Fen edge and other similar landscapes in Norfolk.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2019-11-22T00:00:00Z,,,375,,,,160,1,Garry Crace,Garry Crace,Eastern,Norfolk,Breckland,North Tuddenham,TG0514,From finder,52.68488403,1.03148402,NMS-C8BC70,,HERC8BC70_MBA_Palstave.JPG,Middle Bronze Age Palstave,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/HERC8BC70_MBA_Palstave.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1140571.jpg

The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides.

The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval/leaf-shaped blade, with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces. The mid-rib is lozenge shaped and tapers from the tip of the spearhead into the socket of the spear. The socket is hollow and has cast side loops roughly half way up the socketed end on opposing sides. The socketed end is slightly chipped but overall the object shows few signs of wear. The object has a smooth dark brown to dark green patina, which is pitted in places.



This form of spearhead can be classified as Davis Group 6 (Davis 2017). Davis (2017) suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He thus dates these types to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, circa 1550-1250 BC. As such this example has been similarly dated.

There are the remains of cast loops, one on each side, halfway down the socket. Above the loops the shaft narrows before widening to form the base of the blade.  It measures 34.1mm in length, 10.6mm in  width, 5.8mm in thickness and weighs 10.16g. 



Davis describes spearheads from the earlier MBA as those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket. He dates these to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC. (Classified as type 6).

The spearhead is 101mm in length, with a pointed leaf-shaped blade, 20mm wide across the rounded lower part of the wings, which comprises half of the extant length of the spearhead. This has a prominent rounded midrib which runs seamlessly from the socket to the blade tip. The socket is conical with a flanking pair of small rounded side loops around one third of the way up the length of the spearhead from the open socket. One of these loops is incomplete.","Cf Davis’ (2012) Group 6 (Developed side-looped) type.

1028127,Razor,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,2150,1500,"A copper or copper-alloy leaf shaped razor or knife dating to the Middle Bronze Age c. 2150-1500 BC.



The leaf shaped blade is lenticular in cross-section. One surface is almost flat and the other slightly convex possibly with the remains of a midrib. The tang is also lenticular  in cross section with opposing convex surfaces. The surface extending from the flat side of the blade steeply convex and the opposing side extending from the midrib side is gently convex and almost flat. The tang measures12.44mm at the base of the blade tapering to a point. It thickens from 7.68mm tapering to 1.75mm at the tip. The side profile of the tang terminates in a curve with a sharply upturned tip.The object is covered in pale green corrosion, but is a bright copper underneath. 



Measurements: length: 91.86mm; width: 32.78mm; thickness of blade: 7.31mm and weight: 51.75g. 



Discussion: The upturned tang would have held the original wood, bone or antler handle in place. Other similar examples on the database include: LANCUM-0FBC03; LEIC-081BB1; SF5067. See also Watson, P. 1993 no. 76, a razor metal detected in 1986 in Bewdley Worcestershire and now in Birmingham museum (1987.A218.).



Elle De Spretter notes that the shape is consistent with Peggy Piggot's Class I, Butler and Smith Class Ib and Jockenhovel's double edge with long oval blade and tang.

1028233,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1300,"A cast copper-alloy flanged axe dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1600-1300 BC. It is probably from Needham Period 4-5; the Arreton, Acton or Taunton metalwork assemblage. There is a lozenge shaped flange on each side of the butt end. The blade tip is crescent shaped but no bevels are visible. The sides of the blade flare towards the cutting edge, and are curved. There is no stop ridge for the handle to butt against, but the blade is thicker than the septum. There is a raised curved line at the haft end of the blade - a shield pattern - on both faces, and within the shield is a central arris running along the axe towards the septum. The surfaces inside the flanges are smooth and deep green, but the more exposed surfaces are extensively pitted. The butt end is damaged, so it is not clear if it was notched (concave) or not. The object weighs 446g, has a length of 151.7mm, a width of 29.7mm and has a thickness of 29mm.  



Compare DOR-5D7F46 which cites Peter Reavill who reports that Burgess and Schmidt note the affinities of the shield shaped pattern to that seen on Palstaves of the same period (pp 84-89)"" suggesting a date of about 1600-1400 BC (Needham Periods 4-5 and Burgess Metal Working Stage VII and VIII).

1028545,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A complete but chipped copper alloy spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1550-1250 cal BC) consisting of a circular socket with side loops above which is a leaf shaped blade. 



The spearhead's blade is broadly leaf shaped in plan with a point of maximum width (PMW) placed 14.5mm along its 43.2mm length. Below the PMW the blade edges first narrow in a convex arc before abruptly becoming straight diagonal lines to meet the haft of the object. Above the PMW they narrow smoothly in a convex arc to the blades' point. Both blades have irregular chips missing possibly from damage in the soil, although there are at least two (maybe three) V-shaped chips in one blade near the tip of the spear that may be from use or an act of deliberate damage.  The mid-rib  is pronounced, runs the length of the blade and is lozenge shaped in cross section. the blade is flat beyond the midrib with no evidence of a bevel.



The socket is circular in cross section with a maximum diameter of 14.3mm at its base. The socket contain concreted soil within it. The spear's has cast side loops placed roughly half way up the socketed end on opposing sides. each loop is c. 10.9mm long, thin (2.0mm wide) and has a sub-oval hole. They do not appear to have been hammered after casting having a stringy appearance. Two casting seem run the length of the socket along lines that include each of the side loops. These are most pronounced between the side loops and blade.



The spear has a mostly thick dark green patina that is chipped to reveal a lighter green patina below. There are some lighter bronze scratches possibly from recent damage by the plough.



The spearhead is 87.0mm long, 14.3mm thick at the socket narrowing to c.2.3mm thick at the blade tip and weighs 22.31 grams.  



Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis'  (1909) Class IV which they date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Davis (2012) has recently provided a more thorough typology of Bronze Age spearheads in Britain within this typology this form most closely matches his type 6E (leaf shaped) with a point of maximum width placed c. 34% along the blades length and convex blade edges. While the lower blade edge is somewhat angular similar to those seen on Kite shaped spearheads, these may be warped and are illustrated on further leaf shaped spearheads illustrated by Davis (2012: pl. 34, Nos. 570, 584. 587 and 590). Davis (2012: 108-9) argues side looped forms to The Acton Park Phase (1550-1400 cal BC) with the suggestion that in some areas this use may be extended slightly into the Taunton Phase (1400-1250 cal BC).  A date of c. 1550 to 1250 cal BC is most appropriate (following Needham et al. 1997) this would match Needham's (1996) period 5.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-04-23T23:00:00Z,2021-04-23T23:00:00Z,,,22.31,,,14.3,87,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South East,Buckinghamshire,Aylesbury Vale,Steeple Claydon,SP6827,From finder,51.93736093,-1.01228172,OXON-0CE8E2,,OXON0CE8E2.jpg,Middle Bronze Age spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON0CE8E2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1145626.jpg

1030501,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe fragment of indeterminate type and of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries dated to c. 1150 – 600BC



The fragmentary cast axe is represented by a blade fragment (with a surviving length of 42.3mm, a maximum thickness of 12.2mm and a weight of 65.5g). The axe has broken in antiquity across one face and through the base of the socket on the other face. The socket is rectangular (33.4mm wide). The sides appear to be straight and gradually divergent to the blade edge. Corrosion has removed any casting seam on the sides. The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded (with a width of 42.0mm) but is near-straight and shallow (with a surviving depth of 5mm). The blade faces are slightly convex across their widths but near-flat across the length of the more complete face. There is no surviving evidence for ribs on the face but the surface is very heavily corroded. Traces of a mid to dark green patina are evident but much of the surface has a pale-green active corrosion.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.

1030779,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-800,"A copper alloy fragment of a Bronze Age sword dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age, 1300 BC to 800 BC. It is also possible that the fragment is from a dirk or rapier. The blade is lentoid in cross-section with edge bevels on both faces. Both ends are broken and the damage does not appear to be recent. The breaks are patinated but not worn. The fragment tapers and has straight edges. The surface has been recently slightly damaged in the centre where the patina is missing. There appears to be post depositional bending in the centre, causing cracks in the patina, which is a blue-green colour where it is undisturbed. The fragment is 103.1mm long; 36.3mm wide narrowing to 27.3mm; 6.3mm thick, and it weighs 117.5g.



See https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/swords. This fragment is probably most likely to be from a Wilburton or Ewart Park type sword but could also be from the Taunton or Penard style phases. Compare WMID-871F5F and YORYM-17D783.



The location of the findspot in the Aire Valley, fairly near to the burial mounds and henge at Ferrybridge, may be significant, and could suggest intentional deposition in a riverine environment, perhpas after being deliberately broken.","
Bronze Age swords are not common finds in North Yorkshire, so it has been made a find of note.

1031192,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"A late bronze age socketed axehead which retains a portion of wood within the socket. The axehead is of a late Bronze Age type probably attributable to the Ewart Park Metalworking Industry, (c. 1000-700BC) with a single sideloop near the socket and three moulded ridges to each side of the blade which run half way down to the cutting edge. There is corrosion damage to the socket end on one side which has resulted in three fragments breaking away; they are however retained (2nd image). The socket is 37.3mm by 44mm and of sub rectangular form with a circumferential ridge around the opening. The blade edge is damaged from corrosion but flares slightly and tapers to a thickness of around 7mm. There are casting spurs along the seams on the sides.



The wood in the socket is soft and fibrous and a light tan / brown in colour. It appears to completely fill the hollow centre of the axehead (3rd image).","
The retention of wood within the socket of this axehead is exceptionally rare and made possibly only by localised anaerobic preservation in a waterlogged context (possibly a ditch fill). These conditions have further resulted in poor preservation of the metal.

1031609,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-800,"A copper alloy penannular ring or ring core of probable Bronze Age date (c. 1300-800BC). The ring is made from a circular sectioned loop. The original surface is missing, and green and brown copper corrosion products cover the ring. The blue corrosion product is likely azurite. Objects such as this are often termed “ring money” or “hair rings” but are most likely a form of personal adornment worn on the nose or ears.  Typically dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, it is suggested in NMGW-04216C that they in fact originate in the Middle bronze age and continue in use until the end of the Bronze Age. This means a wider date range of c. 1300-800BC must be given for this object. 



It is possible that this object is a core onto which sheet gold or gold/silver alloy would have been fixed. The XRF results may support this as a trace quantity of gold and silver was detected.

1031731,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"Incomplete Late Bronze Age copper-alloy socketed axehead. The mouth of the socket has become squashed and broken (and the breaks worn). Approximately half of the mouth is missing to a depth of 16 to 20mm. Another quarter of similar depth is detached but extant, while the fourth quarter is in-situ and integral. The detached fragment fits back onto the axehead well, in a position opposite and squashed against the integral quarter. Both parts are thickened at the rim and their shape indicates that the mouth was originally oval.



The axehead is sub-rectangular in transverse cross-section (rounded corners and slightly convex faces). In width, it tapers concavely from the mouth to the centre and then expands concavely to the lateral tips of the curved cutting edge.  In thickness, it expands convexly from the mouth to a point about a third of the way along of its length (mainly or wholly due to having been squashed) and then tapers convexly from there until it terminates in a point at the cutting edge.



The two narrow faces each bear a longitudinal casting seam, and one bears a loop, which is biconvex in cross-section and situated close to the mouth.

1033366,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1600,"An incomplete copper-alloy, flanged axehead, dating from the final phase of the Early to the earliest Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000 - 1500 BC). Possibly of Arreton type dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 BC.



Description: The axehead survives in two heavily corroded pieces. the blade end has snapped just about 3 cms past the shallow proto stop ridge. It has flanged parallel sides which run from the edge of the blade along the body towards the butt. The flanges appears to be cast rather than hammered out. The blade itself is a wide crescent shape with slightly upturned corners. The flanges narrow slightly towards the centre of the body and widen back towards the edge they are also shallower at each end. The axehead's surface is heavily patinated and pitted with some abrasion along the edges. The break are heavily abraded and likely having occured while in the ground. The corrosion is very advanced



Measurements: 172mm long, 69mm wide, 31mm thick (at thickest) and 500g in weight



Discussion: The axehead superficially seems to fit with the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (Burgess and Schmidt, 1981. 65 - 75). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.

The axehead is incomplete, the butt end is missing with an uneven break through the septum 30mm from the stop ridge. The stop has rounded corners. The surface is very corroded and pitted, but there appears to be a rounded central midrib on both faces.  The casting seam is visible along both sides of the axehead with two raised protrusions on one side which are the vestigial remain of the small loop. The blade is narrow and slim, concave below the stop and tapering to a slightly flared curved cutting edge.

1034706,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1500,500,"Copper alloy (bronze) casting waste of uncertain date; most probably Mid - Late Bronze Age (1500-700 BC). However, due to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from Bronze Age - Roman period (c. 1500 BC - 450 AD). This fragment is from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould. The casting waste is conical; being oval in plan and D shaped in cross section. In profile the edges of the waste taper relatively evenly. The base of the casting waste is irregular with the remains of two runners / casting jets being present. These jets / runners are heavily abraded. The sides show no evidence of casting seams although they are also similarly abraded. The upper surface is pitted and rough, although heavily patinated: at the centre of the upper surface is a slight depression. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. The casting waste is a mid green colour with a slight mid grey coloured corrosion product present in several areas. Casting waste is very hard to date in isolation but the patina and form might suggest a Bronze Age - Roman date. The fact that this mould comes to an oval broken edge may suggest that it was for casting a palstave or possibly a tool; it is most likely to date from the Middle Bronze Age. A direct comparison has not been found. The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.

1037997,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"A complete copper alloy unlooped and unfinished palstave axehead of middle Bronze Age date (c.1400-1100 BC), possibl of 'South Western type'. Rowlands 'Class 3 Group 2'.



Description:  The axhead has a solidly rectilinear butt which proceeds to flare outwards to the cutting edge. There is a distinct central mid-rib on the blade. Extended raised lines on both sides of the flaring flanges adjacent to the stop appear to be casting marks, which were not removed before deposition. The butt also has a swell on one side perhaps a casting fault which was not cleaned or prepared before use/deposition. The blade itself is triangular and incomplete. The axehead is heavily patinated and pitted due to corrossion. It has a mid - dark green colouraiton with some dark brown patches and speckles.



Discussion: This palstave appears to be an example of the South Western type, which is commonly found across the South West of England in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset. Multiple single examples have been recorded by the PAS, including DEV-01DDC5 (Shipley 2018), DEV-054D5E (Shipley 2020) and SOM-F224AB (Caswell 2019). Pearce (1983: 432-3) illustrates a number of comparable examples in her study of metalwork from the region. 



They are also comparable to those palstaves placed within Rowlands 'Class 3 Group 2' (see Rowlands 1976: pl 2 85 no.3, and p. 247). Rowlands Class 3 is characterised by a U-shaped septum profile, low triangular or slightly convex flanges, a straight sided triangular or crinoline blade and a triangular depression or ribbed motif beneath the stop-ridge (Rowlands 1976: 32-33). Group 1 and 2 within Class 3 are divided based on blade width, being 7-8cm and 5-6cm respectively. This group, having blades less than 6cm in width therefore fit in Group 2. This class is associated with Needham (1996)’s Period 5.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-09-17T23:00:00Z,,,,428,,,27.5,169,1,Mr David Clarke,Mr David Clarke,South East,Kent,Dover,Ash,TR3059,GPS (from the finder),51.28367611,1.29683732,PUBLIC-8AA4E8,,misc3831.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/stuff8472/misc3831.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1154294.jpg

The blade projects from the hilt with a width of c.19.3mm after which its sides narrow gradullay in a straight line to c.15.9mm mm from where it ends in a transverse break which is patinated. The blade is vesica (pointed oval) shape in cross section with a sligthly flattened midrib from which it narrows more sharply to an edge that now has many chips along it.



The surviving portion of the hilt is oval in plan but its unlikely to represent its original from. It is divided from the blade by two narrow contractions.



The object has a medium green patina.



The fragment of the object is 67mm long, 19.3mm wide, and is 4.0mm thick. It weighs 26.42 grams.



Without the entirety of the blade the type of weapon must be general. It can be classed as one of Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group IV: Notched butt weapons with reworked butts, e.g. Nos. 898-950 (Burgess and Gerloff 1981: Plate 110) although other type II and type IV rapiers show modification to become similar to this example. These probably date slightly later than the original weapons, so a date in the later Middle Bronze Age or earlier Late Bronze Age seem feasible. Similar examples exist on the database such as.

The object is a miniature or model flat axehead or chisel. The sides are bowed. It is trapezoidal and wedge-shaped in cross-section with a flaring cutting edge and narrowed shaft. The sides descend from the butt almost vertically then expand in a smooth curve to produce a cutting edge.

Diminutive axes are often associated with Roman votive offerings. However, the axe recorded here is clearly of a Bronze Age form. Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are becoming established. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function. Other examples of diminutive axes can be seen in Needham (unpublished; figures 77, 82 and 91). Other examples can also be seen in Needham 1988, 'Selective deposition in the British Early Bronze Age', World Archaeology, volume 20, number 2, figure 4.

Only the socket and the lower part of the blade survives. There are side loops on the socket, and the recess only extends just into the blade. There is a casting flaw leaving a hole in one face of the lower blade. Most of the blade has broken off and is missing, and the break is patinated. The midrib has a lozenge shaped cross-section. The mouth of the socket may be broken too - it ends unusually close to the loops and the side curve outwards. There is also a tear in one face of the socket. One face of the spearhead is pitted except on the base of the socket, with a straight line between the two finishes, raising the question of what caused this differential patination.

The palstave has an incomplete length of 130.3mm and a weight of 394.5g. A transverse break at the butt end of the flanges means that the butt is missing but can be assumed to have been relatively narrow- the width at the break is 23.1mm, tapering slightly from the maximum width at the flanges of 28.1mm (not including the side loop). The sides are slightly convex as far as the high point of the stop and are then straight and slightly faceted before flaring out to the expanded blade. The roughly ovoid/flame shaped flanges are relatively high, being 32.6mm at their point of maximum breadth, reaching this point above the stops. The flanges can be assumed to have been slightly higher originally, as the edges show damage. The septum is c. 5.2mm thick and somewhat concave, ending in rounded stops. The broken loop is very slight, being a maximum of only 5.3mm thick and 18.2mm long. It extends from just above to just below the stops. The blade projects seamlessly from the flanges, with the sides smoothly narrowing down from the above the stops before. The length from the stops to the middle of the blade edge is 85.7mm. The blade is decorated with a single broad, poorly defined midrib on each face which extends from the stops to the top of the blade facet. The expanded blade has an incomplete width of 57.8mm, with one of the blade tips, and some of the edge missing. The blade has a maximum thickness below the stop of 27mm and thins to 11.1mm at the blade facet. The maximum length of the blade facet is c. 14mm. Some possible sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge are visible, although the corrosion and abrasion damage on this part of the palstave can make it difficult to be certain.  File marks, presumably from removing casting flashing, are visible on both sides of the blade.  A single casting flaw is visible on one face of the septum, consisting of a cavity that extends through the stop wall and into the body of the palstave.



The palstave is in relatively good condition, with the majority of the original metal surface remaining, which bears a dark green, brown and black patina.

The object is slightly irregular in shape and possibly bent and damaged with losses to the blade edge from use. The surface is pitted and has a green patina consistent with prehistoric metalwork.","Small chisels and tools of similar type were used into the Medieval period, but comparable examples on the database such as SF-3041F9, SF-81B0CD and published examples such as Pendleton (1999, fig.67, no.291) suggest a prehistoric date.

1040552,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1140,"An incomplete cast copper alloy palstave of Group III (Low flanged, Broad bladed), dating to the Middle Bronze Age from the Acton Park to Penard Metalworking phases (c.1500-1140 BC). 



The palstave has an incomplete length of 125mm from butt to blade edge, and a weight of 293.1g. The butt ends in a transverse break at around the point where the flanges meet the septum, the width at this point is 21.5mm. The flanges are badly damaged and the original shape is uncertain. The septum is largely straight, with a very slight taper towards the butt, and is 5.6mm thick. The Flanges form a straight rectangular stop ridge, which projects above the maximum surviving height of the flanges (24.6mm). The palstave originally had a side loop on one side overlapping the stop ridge, now only visible as attachment scars.



The blade is fairly broad with concave edges expanding to flared tips (now damaged, one missing entirely) and a curved blade edge. A slight blade bevel is just visible, being roughly ??mm. A slight raised area running down the centre of the blade from the stop on both faces suggests that the axe had a poorly defined, now almost imperceptible midrib. No other decoration is visible. 



The palstave’s surface is pitted with green to brown patchy colouring- the original surface is missing from the entire palstave with the exception of inside the flanges and on the septum, where it has a green patina. The flanges are very badly damaged, being almost entirely gone on one side, and showing fresh bronze, presumably from recovery damage.

1043239,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A slender copper alloy flat developed axehead or possibly a chisel, dating to the Early Bronze Age, c. 2000-1700 BC. 



The object is markedly petite, rectangular in shape, and an extremely flattened pointed oval in section, not bulbous enough to be described as lenticular. The object flares very slightly from the butt to the cutting edge, but this is extremely subtle and not characteristic of broad flared axeheads. There are slightly raised flanges present, but these are only present on one surface, and can only be felt rather than seen. There is a suggestion of a slight nick at the butt but it is otherwise complete. The surface is pitted and a mixture of typical green patinisation, soil staining in the pits, and flecks of the original high shine surface. 



The object's slender size implies it could potentially be a deliberately manufactured miniature object, with parallels including SWYOR-6E7AE7, which references the similar HAMP-710DC5, and presents a nuanced discussion of the designation of these objects as chisels, axeheads, or miniature objects. NLM-E45686, recorded as a chisel, is a potentially close parallel, although that record (in spite of the diminutive size of the object) denies that these artefacts are likely of Bronze Age date and suggests a broader range. This may be due to the lack of a tang, typical of Bronze Age chisel forms. Delicate, rather than miniature, flanged axeheads are discussed at length in the record for HESH-FBF348, but this example is distinctly truncated in comparison. For this example, a designation as Flat Axehead is considered to be most appropriate.

Description: The butt end has rounded is rounded. The flanges begin about a third of the way along the butt's length. The cleft between the flanges is raltively smother perhaps from use. There is a significant casting fault in one side of the butt, rectangular in shape. The casting seem is visible along the sides of the axehead, though some effort to reduce it appears to have taken place. The stop is pronounced and overhangs a little which accentuates the wasting effect of the blade's flare. The stop has right-angled corners with the flanges. The loop is on one side which arcs over the position on the stop. The blade is long, thin and narrow and extends extensively before flaring out at the blade end. there is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade.



The axehead is has a heaivly modttled patination. Within the flanges it has a dark grey-green patination, towards the butt end and along the flanges it has a much lighter green-white corrosion cause by wear and corrosion. The blade end is a medium mid green colour. There are some areas of historic damage across the blade indicated by their patination.

The axehead has high side flanges which are rounded rectangular in profile stepped at the stop ridges. The tops of the flanges on both sides are tall and the same height as the stop ridge. The flanges taper to the rear ans do not extend into the butt. The stop ridges are rounded at the top, and curved. On one side the stop is undercut with a ‘blowhole’ like casting flaw. The butt of the axe head is the most corroded part, but it appears to taper into a straight edge. On one side, cast on the midline of the flange and with the lower attachment point ibeyond the stop ridge, is a low-arched side loop with a sub-circular aperture in line with the stop ridge. The broad blade is a triangular wedge-shape; it flares from below the stop and terminates in a wide, crescent-shaped cutting edge. The front and rear faces of the blade have a low midrib extending centrally from below the stop ridge to about three quarters of the way down the blade; it is more visible on one side than the other due to surface corrosion. There are traces of the casting lines along both sides from the flanges and down the sides of the blade which have been trimmed and hammered flat when the axe was prepared for use. The object has not been cleaned and there are still areas with soil adhereing.

1043972,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axe head of indeterminate type and of Late Bronze Age date, probably of the Ewart Park metalworking phase (c. 1000-800BC). The axe is incomplete, missing large parts of the mouth moulding, the side loop, the entire blade edge, and any potential blade tips. This lack of key diagnostic features makes it hard to place this axe into a typology, but it shows similarities to the South Eastern Type.

The mouth moulding is a simple raised band c. 10mm wide in its surviving areas. The mouth is 28.2mm thick at the mouth moulding and 33.3mm wide, with internal dimensions of 24.65mm wide and 19.8mm wide. Most of the mouth moulding has delaminated from the metallic core and is lost, so the external measurements are incomplete. This loss of material makes the external profile of the mouth hard to judge, but seems to have been angular, potentially sub rectangular. The internal mouth profile is uneven and somewhat rectangular. Both faces are undecorated and smooth.

The loop sprang from the bottom of the mouth moulding, and had a length of c. 19mm, now only surviving as indistinct attachment scars. The sides of the axe are very slightly concave, and can be seen to start to expand just before the sides end at the break where the blade has detached. The width at the point of the break is 31mm. A surviving core of the blade, including the original surface of one face, projects below this point but gives little clue to the blade&rsquo;s original form or dimensions, being largely a metallic core covered in powdery blue copper alloy corrosion. Both of the sides have prominent casting seams/flashings running from the mouth moulding to the break.

The axe retains most of its original surface, which has an uneven green to brown patina. The broken areas are covered by active baby blue powdery copper alloy corrosion. 

While this axe is difficult to firmly place as a South Eastern type axe, it certainly shows typological affinities to examples such as No. 1300 in Schmidt &amp; Burgess (1981). Mark Lodwick comments: South Eastern type axes are often associated with the Carp&#39;s Tongue complex of North West France (Schmidt &amp; Burgess, 1981, p 217), which heavily influences hoard composition in Lowland England. The type is also well represented throughout Britain and is present in the Llantwit tradition of south east Wales, represented within the eponymous hoard and elsewhere.

1044031,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,MODERN,-2350,2000,"Unidentified cast copper-alloy object of uncertain date. It is a solid and heavy bar with four long narrow faces, one of which is divided into two gently sloping facets by a central longitudinal ridge, which may be a casting seam. The end faces and the cross-sectional form are pentagonal, but nearly square: the three unfaceted sides are at approximately right-angles to each other and of similar widths. All faces and facets are generally flat (even the sloping ones). Both ends of the bar splay slightly on all sides, suggesting that they may have been subject to a compressive hammering force.



One of the two sloping facets is raised a little higher than its counterpart. That is to say it slopes directly from the ridge, whereas the latter steps down a fraction of a millimetre before sloping away. This is most obvious at the centre of the ridge; the difference in level gradually diminishes towards the ends until it is imperceptible, perhaps because of the hammering. The higher facet is additionally distinguished from the other facet and all the other faces in that its surface is completely covered in fine grooves, which appear to be file-marks. It also has a single oblique ridge running across it, not centrally, which looks like another casting seam. The file marks on the shorter side of the oblique ridge are finer and equally oblique. Those on the long side are coarser and transverse. Close inspection of the file marks reveals the coarser ones to be composed of two rows of opposed and interspersing long and narrow triangular ridges, with a zig-zag groove running between them. The finer marks are continuous (unbroken from side to side) and near parallel grooves and ridges. There are further fine transverse and oblique file marks visible here and there alongside one of the long edges on the face directly opposite the ridged face.



There are some scratches on one of the other long faces that appear accidental. The patina on all surfaces is dark green. There is no evidence of any breaks.

The spearhead is 90% complete; an irregular tear is present along the mid-rib socket between the two blades. The overall shape of the spearhead is broadly leaf shaped, with a 'flame shaped' blade. Two circular peg holes are present, one on either side of the socket. These have an internal diameter of 6.1 mm. The base of the socket is circular and has a depth of 123.7 mm. Blade facets are visible along the edge of the blades on the undamaged side. The spearhead is a dark brown to mid green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion has caused the original surface to flake away in a few areas, these are dark green in colour.

Description: The blade has a narrow lozenge cross-sectioned, thickening only slightly towards the hilt end. The point is missing but it appears likely to have been pointed rather than rounded. The blade is a rough narrow triangle in plan flaring slightly towards the hilt end. There is a slightly raised mid-rib along the blades length. At the hilt end are the remains of two semi-circular or rivet holes, these have broken cross their width, one side has broken more extensively than the other.

All faces of the head and beak are intentionally slightly convex, one of the faces set at 90 degrees to the spike has a sub-circular rough divot in alignment to the arris on top, this is very likely to be the remains of a second beak/spike that has broken in antiquity, presumably through use. The remaining original surfaces are dark chocolate brown with the recent losses to the surface now mid-green. There are some inconsistencies with the casting on the head, mostly to the side with the missing projection, the other work surfaces are cleaned up a little after casting, but the the angled top of the head has had more attention, it is neatly finished with slight angled scratches to the surfaces from abrasion, presumably from grinding and polishing with some sort of fine-grained stone, there are at least four impressions from a fine semi-circular punch to the larger work surface of the angled head, there appears to be a much deeper punch mark of the same type just below and to one side of the missing beak.

Similar examples of copper alloy beads recorded on the PAS database include  CAM-DD9C51 and LEIC-3641F5. A gold example from Gloucestershire, GLO-46CA05 (2014T358) has also been reported and the record by Kurt Adams comments: ""The gold bead is likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC) based on several close comparanda. The three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham, hoard are similar in form, size and weight to the Salthouse bead (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts (including bronze palstaves) that allow it to be dated to c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid.).

The blade of the palstave has convex expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is blunt and abraded and is slightly asymmetrical. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the thickest section being at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge descends a vertical rib that extends to the top of the edge bevel. Here the sides are slightly thickened in line with the central rib to create three ribs separated by two hollows.



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged and is incomplete. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) on one side is damaged with incomplete flanged facets. No casting seam is evident.

1046996,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1140,-700,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed axe head of Late Bronze Age date, likely dating from the Wilburton-Wallington metalworking phase to the Llyn Fawr Phase (c. 1140 to 700 BC).



The fragment consists solely of part of the blade nearest to one blade tip, one side and face of the axe, and part of the very bottom of the socket of the axe. The cutting edge of the blade is missing, but enough remains of the side and blade to see that the blade curved down from a now missing projecting blade tip. The fragment measures 24.9mm from the broken tip to the break perpendicular to the blade edge.



The base of the socket is a maximum of 17.2mm from the broken blade edge, and measures 14.9mm in length from the side to the break. A fragment of one face survives projecting 8.9mm up from the base of the socket. The face wall is 4.6mm thick, while the remaining scar from the other wall is 3mm across, although possibly incomplete. 



Only 10.6mm of one side remains, with possible flashing remaining, and a visible expansion to form the blade tip.



The extremely fragmentary nature of the object leaves too few diagnostic features to place it comfortably into a precise type, but a socketed axe like this likely dates to between Wilburton-Wallington and Llyn Fawr metalworking phases. Most socketed axes from South Wales date to the Ewart Park metalworking phase. The way in which this axe has been broken suggests intentional destruction.

1047773,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 11.9 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 21.1 mm (thickness 2.5 mm).



It measures 46.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 21.1 mm, width at the butt is 11.9 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 23.5 grams.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

1048149,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete Middle Bronze unlooped palstave axehead dating to c. 1500-1150 cal BC. It is missing the majority of its blade to an abraded transverse break placed 14mm below the stopridge.



The butt of the axe is c.20.2mm wide, c.3.9mm thick and has a diagonal edge that is straight but worn.  The septum measures c.66.9mm in length and is mostly consistent in thickness along its length narrowing very slightly at the stop ridge due to two small casting flaws on each side. The flanges of this axe begin 11mm after the butt and widen in a slightly convex curve reaching their tallest point (c.26mm) 9mm before the stop ridge from which they are a consistent height. The stop ridge is a very shallow crescent shape.



The blade extends 14mm beyond the stop ridge before ending in an abraded break over which distance it is straight sided. It is thinner than the stop ridge being c.9.9mm thick creating a slight ledge marked by a concave curve. It narrows slightly along its length. The flanges continue along the outside edges of the axe creating two raised borders (flange extensions) which flank a pronounced a central raised midrib.



 Shallow but clear casting seams can be seen running along the middle of the axe down its length.



The axe has a dark orange brown patina that has been chipped in a few spots revealing light green colour underneath. There are some concreted iron pan deposits around the septum suggesting it was, at some point placed within waterlogged conditions.



The palstave is 89.7mm long, 25.5mm wide, 26mm thick if including the flanges and weighs 181 grams



The characteristic features of this palstave are the relatively straight stop ridge (rather than curved), convex and then stepped flanges which begin after the butt and which rise higher than the the stop ridge, and raised flange continuations flanking a midrib decorating the blade. The lack of a blade shape prevents a certain identification however these features are all shared by Primary phase palstaves of the Oxford type examples of which are illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981: pl.58 Nos 788-799).

1048409,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete copper alloy chisel or possible miniature axehead dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2000BC -1700 BC). The object is trapezoidal in plan and wedge-shaped in cross-section with a flaring cutting edge and narrowed shaft. The sides descend from the butt almost vertically then fan out in a smooth curve to form the, now chipped, cutting edge. 



For a comparable example see PAS record LIN-9CD5CA. According to Brundle (2021) 'diminutive axes are often associated with Roman votive offerings. However, the axe recorded here is clearly of a Bronze Age form. Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are becoming established. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III)', 



The object measures 42mm in length and weighs 7g.

1048926,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-950,-750,"A cast copper-alloy socketed axehead fragment, dating from the Late Bronze Age to early Iron Age,(c. 950-750 BC).



The surviving element consists of the cutting edge which is crescentic, and sharply flaring. The surviving fragment has a hollow centre, representing the beginning of a socket. The front and rear surfaces of the axe are slightly concave with multiple sub-oval indentations and there are raised casting seams remaining along each side.  The blade edge is worn, and the tips irregular through use.  while the breaks on the body are also old and worn. The exterior surfaces of the axehead have a mid-green patina. 



Not enough of the artefact is extant in order to determine further typological designation, but socketed axes generally date from the Middle to Late Bronze Age through to the Early Iron Age (circa BC 1300-BC 800). It is possibly of Southern Eastern type, which date c. 900-600 BC.

1048956,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy Bronze Age blade fragment from a spear or dagger. The fragment is broadly rectangular in shape and lentoid in cross-section, with gradually tapering sides. The long edges are worn and uneven, being damaged in several places. The breaks at each end are old, worn and patinated, suggesting they occurred in antiquity. Both faces of the blade have etched decoration along the long edges in the form of four or five linear grooves. The area of the blade between this decoration is undecorated and plain in appearance.



The blade fragment is very worn and abraded. The surfaces are pitted and rough, with some lamination in places.



The patina is mid-green in colour and evenly distributed, with small sparse patches of mid-brown across the surfaces.



The blade fragment measures 33.08mm in length, a maximum of 20.94mm in width and a maximum of 5.56mm in thickness. It weighs 14.70 grams.



Peter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer for Shropshire, suggests that the blade is most likely the tip of a Late Bronze Age (c. 1100-800 BC) spearhead decorated with grooves, or possibly, based on the decoration, a fragment from an earlier object - such as an arreton / Snowshill dagger of the Early Bronze Age III (c. 1600-1400 BC), though these are very rare and thus more unlikely (e.g. HAMP-C13678).","The finder reports that this was found within a few feet of BH-C4785A, which may or may not be related.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-09-01T23:00:00Z,2021-09-01T23:00:00Z,,,14.7,,,5.56,33.08,1,Matthew Fittock,Matthew Fittock,Eastern,Hertfordshire,Dacorum,"Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield",TL0206,GPS (from the finder),51.7434283,-0.5240518,BH-6F439A,,BH6F439A.jpg,Middle to Late Bronze Age cblade fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH6F439A.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1166378.jpg

The fragment is broadly trapezoidal in plan with four unevenly worn edges. The upper edge is relatively straight and has a worn notch of damage towards one end. The adjacent edge has a short triangular recess and a long edge that extends outwards to the lower pointed corner. The opposite short edge has three unevenly spaced semi-circular recesses. The lower edge, meanwhile, is rounded and curves inwards before the break. An integral flange extending along approximately three quarters of this inside edge is broadly sub-triangular in cross-section and expands from what is otherwise the uneven sub-rectangular-sectioned wall.

1051152,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1400,"An incomplete cast copper alloy side-looped spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date. Probably of Davis’ (2012) Group 5 A (Wide Blade) of the Acton Park metalworking phase (1550-1400 BC).



At its mouth, the socket has a diameter of 2mm and an aperture diameter of 17.4mm, as well as an aperture depth greater than 43mm (the very end of the shaft aperture is still filled by soil to an unknown depth). Both side loops are present but damaged, sited 14.4mm to 12.7mm above the socket mouth, measuring 17.2mm long by 6.4mm wide and 17.7mm long by 5.6mm wide respectively. The shape of the loop plates is altered by damage and may originally have been oval or lozenge shaped. The loops are cast in line with the blade, and casting flashing is visible between the socket mouth, the loops and the blade. Much of the flashing appears to have been removed by hammering or possibly filing. Two small (one <0.5mm, the other c. 0.8mm) holes are present in each flashing line 12.7-11.9mm below the blade base respectively. The smaller hole enters the socket at an oblique angle and is partially covered by flashing. The size and positioning make it likely that these holes are chaplet holes, remnants of the casting process. 



The socket tapers into the blade until at c.26.5mm above the bade base becomes a lozenge sectioned midrib that continues as far as the tip. Damage to the blade edges has made it hard to ascertain the blade shape, which is best described as transitional between leaf and flame shaped. It has a blade length of 68.8mm and a 35.4mm wide PMW (Point of Maximum Width) at 32.84% up the full blade length (22.6mm from the blade base). The width of the blade as a percentage of its length is 51.45%. The blade is broad based and curves smoothly from the base to the blade edge. The single intact blade has a small concave “step” from the PMW to the blade edge, after which the blade runs straight to the tip. It is unclear if this is merely damage, or is reworking during the spears’ lifetime. The other blade edge is badly damaged, with 36mm of blade edge destroyed above the PMW and a large chunk 12.7mm long by 8.3mm deep gouged out of the blade just prior to or during recovery. The blades are flat and slightly beveled at the edges.



The identification of this spearhead as Davis’ (2012) Group 5 A (Wide Blade) is not certain, but is most likely based on general morphology, especially width of the blade being equivalent to 51.45% of blade length.

1053687,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"An incomplete copper alloy miniature palstave axehead of probable Middle Bronze Age date (c. 1500-1300 cal BC, Acton Park). It is most similar to a primary shield type and the form is similar on both faces of the axehead. The rounded butt is incomplete with one side more rounded the other indicating an area of loss. It widens to form the septum (23mm at widest point). The flanges are high (c.10mm) and rise steeply from part away (approx. 8.5mm) along the septum before terminating at a prominent stop ridge (19.6mm wide, 21mm thick). From the abrupt slope stop the blade narrows slightly (18.5mm) before broadening outwards to the blade tip (32.9mm), and then turns downwards and curves to form the blade which has a rounded cutting edge. The sides of the flanges are plain and without evidence for side loops. The whole surface is corroded and much of the original surface is missing, but it is possible to see the remains of a shield beneath the stop ridge. The top of one flange is torn with a portion pushed inwards and a small area of loss, most likely caused by plough damage.



This is a rare item with only one other comparable find recorded in the PAS database (WMID-EFD2EE). Both examples have clear stop ridges, visible cutting edges, and no evidence for side loops. Other miniature palstaves recorded with the PAS are of different form or material including BERK-602025, HAMP-0FD867 (copper alloy side loop) and SUR-1C249A (lead side loop). This latter is recorded as an Iron Age or Roman item, which accords with the likely date of the many miniature socketed axeheads recorded with the PAS. For an extensive discussion and typology of these miniature socketed axeheads please see Bliss 2020. For this find, the precision of the form and the condition of the metal suggests it is of Bronze Age date rather than a later imitation, which accords with the tentative dating of WMID-EFD2EE. These miniature palstaves merit further research to identify their likely date and use.

The object is comprised of a sub-rectangular tang (28mm long) with notched terminal and single circular rivet hole (6mm in diameter) placed in the centre. The base of the tang widens producing sloped shoulders that have a width of 22mm which then narrow to form the blade. The blade has bevelled edges, creating a lentoid cross-section, that taper to the tip which is now rounded bat would probably have has a finer point in antiquity.  



That artefact is now bent in the middle at about an 80 degree angle. It is unlikely that this could have happened post-deposition or as a result of agricultural machine activity, but rather could be a deliberate act of deforming this object at deposition.

1054399,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1900,100,"Corroded and worn copper alloy axehead-shaped object. Sub-triangular in plan with the corners of the widest end radiused to a curve, with the opposite end terminating in a sharp point. The mid-section of the sides are symmetrically chamfered. Two thirds of the way towards the pointed end, on one face only, is a blind circular hole. It is unclear if this is by design or a defect from the casting process. The form is very reminiscent of a miniature un-hafted axehead coping an early Bronze Age flat axe. However, the sharp point, chamfered sides and rounded coroners at the blade end are atypical, but the cross-section is classically lenticular for an axehead and the degree of corrosion and patination are commensurate with an early date. Miniature axeheads similar to this object can be seen at NARC-B0797B and YORYM-F02231 on the PAS database. However, on account of the aforementioned atypical features the identity is not conclusive. For example if the sharp end of this object was a worn break it could have originally continued to a loop and perhaps functioned as a hanger in a harness pendant. There is scant evidence for being more definitive.  Diminutive axeheads are often assigned a Roman date, but those copying earlier Bronze Age types are also thought by some scholars to be of their own period.  



A record of a miniature axehead that also has a Bronze Age form (see ESS-819206), when contrasting them with diminutive axeheads found in the Roman period, concludes a preference for the BA type having a ritual use in the Bronze Age, and mentions that other examples of diminutive axes ""can also be seen in Needham (unpublished; figures 77, 82 and 91). Other examples can also be seen in Needham 1988, 'Selective deposition in the British Early Bronze Age', World Archaeology, volume 20, number 2, figure 4. These all illustrate the range in size and form of Bronze Age diminutive axes, enhancing the possibility that these objects are in fact of Bronze Age date."" :

1054874,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete cast copper alloy long flanged axehead (developed flat axe) dating from the final phase of the Early to the earliest Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000 - 1700 BC). The axehead is most probably of the axe type Arreton which is dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.



The object has straight sides, a worn butt end and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders. The cutting edge is broad and crescentic in plan and measures 38.36mm in width. The very edge is worn and incomplete in places The axe has low raised flanges on both faces. The object has a dark brown patina with patches of bright green and light brown corrosion.



Dimensions: Length 85.03mm; width 19.18mm; thickness 10.06mm; weight 83.51g



The axehead is best described as coming from the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 415, 422 and 425). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.



Similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750 - 1600 BC. A similar example which can be found on the database is NMGW-FDBB88.



Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, ""...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembellished faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature. Decoration...becomes a commonplace..."".",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-11-20T00:00:00Z,,,,83.51,,,10.06,85.03,1,Heather Beeton,Heather Beeton,East Midlands,Derbyshire,Derbyshire Dales,Offcote and Underwood,SK2047,GPS (from the finder),53.01992747,-1.7033043,LVPL-617DA6,,LVPL617DA6.jpg,Bronze Age flanged axehead,National Museums Liverpool ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/heatherbeeton/LVPL617DA6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1173748.jpg
1054894,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-950,"A very worn and incomplete cast copper alloy palstave axehead with possible side loop of middle to late Bronze Age date from the period c.1050-950 BC.



The blade of the palstave is sub-oval or tongue shaped in plan. The cutting edge measures 26.39mm in width and is 5.2mm thick. The cutting edge is blunt and damaged. In profile the blade is sub-rectangular and narrow slightly before the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge where ribs might be expected is no visible decoration. The surface of the opposite face is 'clean' and shows no indications of decoration.



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The butt end measures 21.46mm in width and is 3.4mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) measures 45.56mm in length. For one face the septum is prominent with a wide flange. The opposit face has a flat septum and no flange. The flanges may have been misscast or more likely have been lost due to abrasion. It is unclear if a side loop is present due to extreme wear and corrosion.



The object has a light green patina and has arough and pitted surface.



patches of a dark brown surface but most of the axe has a mid-green patina that is roughly abraded and pitted.



Dimensions: Length 109.11mm; width 24.68mm; thickness 13.99m; weight 163.22g



This object is similar to the Type Nettleham axeheads illustrated in Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), plate 67, no 902, espeically if undecorated, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 - BC 950.

1054901,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"A cast copper alloy socketed axe fragment of indeterminate type, probably of Wiburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries and of Bronze Age date (c.1150-600 BC). The axe is represented by a blade fragment only with surviving dimensions of 27.7mm long, &nbsp;max 54mm wide and 12.3mm thick and weighs 62.82g. The top of the fragment has traces of the base socket, broken in old damage. The blade faces are flat across the width and gradually convergent with no traces of ribbing surviving. The remaining portion of the surviving side of the blade is flat, creating a sub-rectangular section at the break. The blade gently flares to the slightly curved edge, which is damaged and missing its original surface.

The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe,&nbsp;c. 1150 &ndash; 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.

The object is a light green mottled patina with areas of bronze corrosion particularly on/near the blade edge and the break.

The cutting edge of the blade is very slightly concave in plan with rounded ends that slope from a slightly convex top edge. The overall length is 69.2mm and max width is 25.4mm. An irrelgular long notch (11.8mm long by 3.5mm thick) along the top edge may be the point at which a tang or hafted handle had attached, but is now missing in old damage. The notch is off-centre measuring 32.2mm from one end, 39.2mm from the other. (A similar notch is seen on NMGW-B18276). The blade is thickest at the centre (5.3mm thick) and thins to the edges, except at the irregular notch. The opposite face is mostly flat with a slight taper towards the cutting edge and a few striations run along the blade, possibly from sharpening. 



The object weighs 30.06g and the metal is smooth with a mid-green patina. Patches of black possible tenorite coating preserves the top edge. The reverse has some spots of bright green bronze corrosion.

The chisel is in good condition and appears undamaged, with evidence for use wear on the blade edge. The chisel has a tapering rectangular-sectioned tang (50.17mm long), which abuts the collared handle stop. The oval collar measures 12.55 mm x 9.65mm. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in cross-section and flares in width to a thin, crescentic cutting edge 31.08 mm wide. The blade sides are slightly concave. The cutting edge is 27.5 mm wide. The object is in very good condition and has a dark brown patina across much of its surface.

The awl is slightly curved and rectangular in cross-section along most of its length. It is widest at 5.43mm approximately 1/3 along its length, the shorter side narrowing to a circular cross-section and terminating in a sharp point. The longer side maintains its rectangular cross-section and curves slightly downwards, although this may be due to damage rather than design. The shorter, rounded section appears much more worn suggesting that the rectangular sectioned element may have been a tang for a handle . The surface is undecorated and has a mid-green patina.



Measurements: Length, 57.45mm; width, 5.92mm; thickness, 5.48mm and weight: 6.79g



Discussion: Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Plain copper alloy awls are hard to date precisely but examples of this form are thought to have been introduced in the Bronze Age (2150-800 BC) with most being Late Bronze Age in date (1150-800 BC).

1055260,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,100,"A cast copper alloy 'moustache-shaped' object of late Bronze Age or Iron Age date. The object has a narrowed body with two sweeping swollen drop shaped ends which taper towards pointed terminals. There are five panels of linear grooves on each rounded side, with medial bands running down the middle, flanked by two panels of oblique lines and then two outer peripheral panels of lines running roughly parallel to those along the centre. The tapering lower projections are undecorated. There is a sub rectangular hollow between the projections suggesting the object fitted to something.



A number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered, with distinct variants identifiable. They are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although recess in the body of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on something, possibly a dagger handle or on the end of a scabbard; however the absence of evidence makes this entirely conjectural.



One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard which contained Bronze Age material but was buried in the Iron Age (Stead, 1998, no.117). Another example was found in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35).","

A fragment of copper alloy socketed axehead of Late Bronze Age date. The find comprises a portion of the mouth, the complete loop, and a portion of the body with traces of three moulded ribs. The 'inside' of the axe has a rough appearance. Apart from the mouth all edges are heavily abraded and patinated in the same dark green as the other surfaces. In places this patination is now missing to reveal a paler light green surface. This is most evident on the reverse break of the body, perhaps suggesting more recent damage by plough or at the time of discovery. It is possible that this item was deliberately broken prior to deposition.

The socketed axe is sub rectangular in shape, with a curved cutting edge. A slight horizontal collar is present on a couple of faces. There is a single loop on one side of the axehead. The loop measures 18.1 mm in length, and 6.6 mm thick. The blade is wide and crescentic with some damage to the cutting edge. The casting seam is visible down both sides externally but is not visible within. Three domed protrusions are visible inside the socket. The mouth of the socket is square. Internally the socket measures 22.8 mm by 21.8 mm.  The socket tapers down to where the crescentic edge of the blade begins. It is 52.2 mm deep.



The axehead measures 65.4 mm in length. The cutting edge is 38.6 mm wide and 4.7 mm thick. The socket is 30.4 mm wide by 31.9 mm thick. The metal is 3.3 mm thick. The axehead weighs 116.3 grams.



This axehead has suffered little damage and is in very good condition with a dark green patina. There is a wide scar across one surface, it was probably struck by the plough whilst in the plough soil.

The axehead is sub-triangular in plan and profile, narrowing towards the butt creating a typical lentoid shape.  The parallel sides are relatively straight, expanding towards a curved shaped blade that has a width of 32.04mm.The sides have been slightly flattened to enable the blade to be fixed to a wooden shaft. Both ends have been worked to produce a sharp cutting surface. The surafce of the metal is slightly corroded and pitted with a dull pale brown patina with some pale green patches.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and thus one of the earliest phases of metalworking in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, corresponding to Needham's (1996)  Period 1-3 c.2500-2050 cal.BC, or slightly later.

The spear has a lozenge shaped cross- section with a high mid-rib which tapers towards from the tip toward the break. The socket is conical and incomplete with part of the reverse section being broken (presumably in antiquity). The surviving socket depth is 67.1 mm. The socket has a circular external as well as internal section. The blade extends at the head of the socket and the overal shape is lost due to abrasion all that remains are shallow crescentic fragments. There is no evidence of side loops, although these may well have been lost through movement in the soil. The socket has two circular peg holes, with an internal diameter of 3.4 mm, one positioned on either side of the socket, beneath the blades. 



It measures 96.9 mm in length, 17.7 mm wide and is 18.8 mm thick. The metal is 2.2 mm thick. It weighs 47.5 g.



The spearhead is a mid green to brown colour. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



The fragment is probably too damaged to be specifically attributed to a specific type - however it shares many attributes of the side looped spearheads (of the Acton Park II phase / assemblage) of the Middle Bronze Age as we as that of the pegged spearheads (Penard phases) of the early Late Bronze Age.",The 3D model has been generated using mobile phone scanning application Qlone.,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-03-27T00:00:00Z,2021-03-27T00:00:00Z,,,47.5,,,18.8,96.9,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Stowe-by-Chartley,SK0329,From finder,52.85848251,-1.9568877,WMID-0A11D2,,WMID0A11D2.JPG,Middle Bronze Age: Incomplete spearhead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID0A11D2.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1182569.jpg

1058513,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Iron Age,IRON AGE,-1150,43,"
Copper alloy mount or fitting of uncertain function and date, probably of Late Bronze Age or Iron Age date and possibly a scabbard chape.



The possible cast mount is complete. The mount is of bulbous bi-lobed form with a curving point projecting from each lobe. At the centre is a shallow rounded groove, widest at the base. Both lobes are decorated with prominent ribbing defined by grooves. The lobes terminate in gently curving points of rounded D-shaped section, slightly flattened on their interiors. The points are not decorated and the interior, near the centre is less finished than the rest of the mount. At the centre is an irregular, sub-circular depression or hollowing. The interior is not finished and would not have been seen. The surface has dark green patina.
","See NMGW-AF1FCC for similar. The object, often referred to as a 'moustache' is recognised object form but poorly understood in terms of its function and date. The object form is quite consistent, being bi-lobed and rounded, often with ribbed decoration and with projecting prongs. An example of the type was found with the Salisbury Hoard and indicates a Bronze or Iron Age date although the style would suggest a Late Bronze to Iron Age date. It has been suggested that the mount may have been used on Iron Age weapons and it seems possible that the pronged form may be consistent with its use as a scabbard chape, although this remains a conjectural identification.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,12.43,,,10.5,32.2,1,Philip Smither,Philip Smither,South East,West Berkshire,West Berkshire,Inkpen,SU3563,,51.36499206,-1.49865433,BERK-4644A3,,BERK4644A3.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK4644A3.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1176333.jpg

In database record SOM-D46055 Ed Caswell comments: The missing mouth makes typological identification difficult, Savory (1980, p 55) suggests that the earliest socketed gouges such as those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings, whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).
