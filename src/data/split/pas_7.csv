481162,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed spearhead, dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1500-800 BC, probably more c. 1400-1000 BC). The fragment consists of only the very tip of the spear, and although the tip is sharp the edges are very worn and the whole object appears heavily rolled (P. Reavill. pers. comm.). The spearhead has a lozenge-shaped cross section, broken towards the tip of the socket. There is the mineralised remains of a wooden object or element on one face of the spearhead; it appears that a casting flaw resulted in a hollow and that the mineralised wood is the remains of packing to keep the shaft in place. Peter Reavill, FLO for Shropshire & Herefordshire comments that the survival of the wood ""would be odd...given the [rolled] condition of the spear.""","
Thanks are extended to Peter Reavill & Dr. Esther Cameron for their help in identifying the spearhead and inclusion.

Its remains consist of a sub-rectangular body in plan, with the remains of the side flanges visible on both faces, though completely flattened on one side. Due to its poor condition, it is difficult to tell if the side flanges were fused or if they were separate elements, but it is likely that these were fused; hence, the date above is suggested for similar types. The chisel or possible axe blade edge has been completely worn away, making a positive identification difficult. The metal surface of the object suffers from bronze disease as well as differential areas of dark brown patina and lighter green patina. An area within the side flanges has built up a higher degree of green corrosion, perhaps indicating where the stop would have been.

The palstave has an even green patina with pitting on the surface. The total (incomplete) length of the axehead is  132.6mm, with the blade (from the edge to the stop) comprising 78.56mm  length and the septum/butt measuring 54mm in length. The flanges have  a maximum breadth of 20.3mm. At its widest, the blade is 44.1mm in breadth from  tip to tip.


The blade is narrow and tapering and the axe is narrow and  unlooped; The butt is broken. The axe has a well defined, rounded  stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. The side  flanges are damaged, particularly on one face where recent unpatinated damage shows that the flanges have recently broken off.  The blade is narrow and trapezoidal, widening gently to the cutting  edge, with little added flare to the tips. The blade faces of early midribbed palstaves  generally have raised edges, as if continuing the line of flanges below  the stop (see: ""The Axes of Scotland and Northern England"", Schmidt and  Burgess, 1981, p.126) but this feature is not present on the palstave  recorded here. There is no shield like depression below the  stop. The patina inside the septum is a smooth and brown layer, the butt end of which has flaked off. The butt is damaged, but looks as if it would have been rounded.

The axes, which are all fragmentary, are of the South-Eastern type. Nos. 1-2 show signs of having been deliberately broken for inclusion as scrap metal. The faceted axe fragment (no. 5) belongs to a distinctive type with noticeably well-finished examples which have a very wide distribution.



1. Socketed axe fragment: South-Eastern



Double mouth moulding. Both faces have wing mouldings. Very faint transverse moulding forming hour-glass with circular pellet prominent beneath mouth moulding and very faint circular moulding between the wing mouldings at the bottom. Casting flashes visible along much of the sides, although they have been removed places. Last vestiges of mouth casting flash and of one casting jet stump visible. Ridges down the centre of the internal faces. The body has many fine transverse and oblique striations. Variable green to dark brown patina. Corrosion damage particularly on the raised areas. Straight break, blade edge missing.

A total of twenty objects are represented in this hoard; six complete or near complete socketed axes all of the South-Eastern type, one Ewart-type sword fragment, two socketed spearheads and ten fragments of standard ingots. Ingots are a well-known feature of this particular period in south-eastern England. The presence of axes, swords and spearheads which may be interpreted as scrap, mixed with ingots of raw material, suggests that this is a founders' hoard.



Although the axes are not fragmented, they do show signs of heavy wear and use and it is likely that they were collected with other surplus bronze to form a metal resource for recycling. A hoard of Bronze Age artefacts of similar types to those represented here was found in close proximity to the findspot of this group of artefacts, by David Button in January 2003 (T200310a). While it is possible that the group of artefacts reported here (T200310b), represents a separate deposit from the earlier discovery in the same field (T200310a), it is also a possibility that the two groups of artefacts originated as part of the same hoard which had been dispersed through the action of the plough.



All of these artefacts fall within the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age period and suggest a date of deposition towards the end of the period, around 1000-800 BC. The hoarding of metalwork at this period was not an uncommon phenomenon, particularly in the south-east of Britain.",4,Copper alloy,Copper alloy,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector during controlled archaeological investigation,2003-02-01T00:00:00Z,2003-02-02T00:00:00Z,2003T10B,,,,,,,20,Sally Worrell,Karen Dunford,South East,Kent,Maidstone,Hollingbourne,TQ8553,Generated from computer mapping software,51.24616687,0.64926212,KENT-757FC0,,Copy of 2003 T10.jpg,A Bronze Age hoard,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/karend1/Copy of 2003 T10.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/372489.jpg

492197,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1200,"Cast copper alloy palstave or flanged axe blade, trapezoidal in plan, rhomboidal in profile and rectangular in section, at the broken end. The opposite blade end tapers to a rounded and damaged edge in profile. The blade is broad and incurved or inturned, instead of flanged, at the cutting edge and has the remains of what might be the tip of a moulded 'V' or shield at the broken end, but this is made more pronounced by corrosion, and it does not extend any further down the centre of the blade. On the opposite face there is a large cavity near the broken edge which was probably where a large lump of corrosion product has come away from the body of the blade. This makes it difficult to see if there was similar moulding on this face. The entire surface is corroded and pitted so that decorative details are lost. The line of one casting seam is still evident down one side of the blade, but the other side is too corroded to make it out. The edges of the sides of the blade, though worn, are still slightly raised, proud of each of the faces. The palstave is missing the central flanged section with stop-ridge for the haft, any side-loop that might have once been there, and the butt end. The lack of stylistic features make it difficult to date the palstave.


Rohl & Needham (1998) illustrate an example of a palstave with a similar shape and slightly flanged blade on page 129, Fig.30, No.145, which is dated to the Taunton phase, c.1400-1275 BC.


Pearce (1983) illustrates similar 'Crediton-type' palstaves with inturned blades, straight sides with slight upraising, and V-shaped mouldings, from Perranzabuloe, Truro and Veryan in Cornwall on pages 577, 579-580, Plates 16,18-19, Nos.125, 144a & 147b.

The blade is semi-circular and at its widest point measures 87mm wide. The blade is narrowed and has a thin cutting edge all along the blade edge. The butt of the axe is semicircular. 

The first half of the handle, behind the blade, has been decorated with a series of engraved lines.  These consist of six horizontal bands each containing a zigzagged line, flanked either end by four bands containing alternating zigzagged or hatched decoration.

The midrib is circular in cross-section, the blades either side triangular in cross-section. The edges of the blades are much worn and at the tip turn inwards sharply (3.38x3.47mm).

493197,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1900,-1600,"A cast copper-alloy dagger dating from the Early Bronze Age, about 1900 BC - 1600 BC. It is a flat riveted knife-dagger type. The blade is slightly bent but seems to be almost complete. It has a mid rib on each face and the blade edges are bevelled. The sides of the blade are slightly convex, but are almost straight. At the hilt, they flare outwards and then meet to form a pointed end. A copper alloy rivet survives in the rivet hole on one side of the hilt. It is at the widest point. The other side is damaged and broken across the rivet hole. The rivet has expanded ends and is sub-circular in section. The organic hilt which would have probably been  carved from bone or antler is lost. None of the daggers on the PAS database have quite the same shape, but for other Bronze Age daggers compare KENT-8D3476 and LANCUM-EDDE97. Ben Roberts of the British Museum comments that: ""This example is of a sub-type that is larger (generally c. 10 cm), with two rivet holes, and which is  found throughout Scotland, Yorkshire and the Pennines (see Gerloff 1976,  165-168, nos. 286-294).""","

A Middle Bronze Age copper-alloy palstave axehead.



Both sides of the 'socket' comprise a flat area flanked by a pair of flanges, with a stop ridge at the bottom. The blade has a longitudinal ridge at the centre of both of its wide faces, and its sides flare towards a rounded cutting edge. A right-angled loop is located on one of the narrower side faces, at the junction between the socket and blade. Extending from both the top and bottom ends of this loop are traces of a casting seam.

494469,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-800,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead with defined slightly raised collar and the remains of a sideloop below it, faceted edges to the sides of the axe and a flanged blade. The collar is incomplete but the side that survives is about 20 mm long and shows that it flanges outwards slightly and would have had a rolled edge. The two base sections of the side loop that remain at either end are cruciform in section and are now worn smooth. The blade is triangular in plan and profile and the socket is sub-rectangular in section. The casting seams on the sides of the axe have been filed down but there are internal central ridges down the interior of each of the four walls which are impressions of the clay core, perhaps from fractures when it was heated.The surface of the axe is pitted and corroded in places, especially on the less complete face, but much of the original surface remains and the deep green patina survives.


Faceted axes were originally an East Anglian type, influenced by a Northern European form, but have since been found to be more prevalent further west, and in this case, likely influenced directly from Brittany (see below).


Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar but narrower faceted socketed axe from Stogursey, Somerset on page 530, Plate 86, No.746c which is dated from the Ewart Park phase (c.1000-800 BC). Another example of a faceted axe with a shorter collar from Battlegore, Somerset is illustrated on page 540, plate 94, No.784d, which was associated with an end-winged axe, a Breton type from Armorica dating from the Ewart Park phase also. A local example from Gillan, St Antony-in-Meneage with the same sub-rectangular section, slight collar above the side loop and faceting is illustrated on page 399, Plate 1, No.2a, and was found with an ingot dating from the Late Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-11-01T00:00:00Z,2010-11-30T00:00:00Z,,,175.69,,,20.7,101,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,St. Enoder,SW9056,GPS (from the finder),50.36634,-4.954223,CORN-60E6C4,,Feb12finz 001.jpg,socketed axe (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Feb12finz 001.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/375041.jpg

495798,Axehead,Bronze Age,,,2300,1900,"Early Bronze Age, near complete copper flat axe. The butt is straight and narrow but is moderately thick (with a width of 19mm and a thickness of 5.5mm). The sides are markedly straight for their entire lengths, gradually diverging from the butt, towards the gently curved blade. There is some damage to the blade being heavily eroded - one blade tip having been lost. The more complete blade tip shows minimal flaring, producing a trapezoidal form. The axe form is unusual within the British and Irish traditions and is possibly a variant of copper trapezoidal axes with a continental European provenance. X-rays showed that there is a dense metal coating of the axe with high levels of silver, plus antimony and lead.

It is  unlooped with high, curved flanges (max. H. 28.2mmmm), fused to the stop  ridge. The width at the butt is 23.4mm. The  flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum  height of c. 12.6mm above the septum  (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge). The stop ridge is stands c. 8mm  above the septum. There is a shield shaped molding beyond the stop  ridge, and fused to it, on both faces (c. 19.5 by 18.0mm). This is  bisected by a molding ridge (seam) running the length of the blade on  both faces; this starts on the lower blade and  terminates before the stop. There are then four parallel ridges decorating the septum near the stop but corrosion obscures where they terminate. There are further longitudinal ridges (casting seams) central  on the sides; these have been finished by trimming the casting flash and  hammering. The blade is 57.5mm across.  The object has suffered heavy corrosion. Where it survives the patina  is dark brown; the metal is generally a mid-brown color. Spread all over the palstave are aqua colored  concretions possibly  from deposition in water.


In total  it is 15.7mm long, 57.7mm wide, 28.2mm thick and weighs 450 grams.","
The palstave was discovered by the finder in a collection of possessions belonging to his father, Sidney Nicholls, who was a local Archaeologist. The exact find spot for the palstave is not know.


http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axe: The term palstave is very misleading as it comes from the Icelandic  'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool not a type of axe. However the term is  used in British archeology to describe where there is a stop  and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker  below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and as time went  on developed loops.

It has a crescent shaped blade which is wider than the body of the axe. The original cutting egde does not survive. The body of the axe is rectangular in section and is unusually thick for a flat axe, suggesting development towards palstave forms. It does not have flanges but the edges are very slightly raised. There is no stop ridge, but the thickest part of the axe is in the centre of the body, and the change of angle forms a line where the stop ridge would develop on later axes. The sides are concave and the faces are two flat facets. The butt also tapers to a thin wedge which may have been crescentic, but is no longer complete. Much of the original surface survives which is a smooth brown patina. Where this is missing, the surface is pitted and rough, and is slightly more green.

502185,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-900,-700,"A complete cast copper-alloy transitional Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age socketed axehead (c. 900-700 BC). The axehead has a facetted body, with one wider face which widens towards the blade and a flanking narrow facet to either side. The socket mouth is round with a square internal socket and there seem to be four casting jets which are visible on the mouth, but flattened. A small collar or moulded ridge is visible directly below the socket mouth and the socket mouth itself is quite rounded on the external surface. The casting lines on either side edge have been trimmed and flattened, but not smoothed. The loop is D-shaped in plan and bears the flattened casting line on its external edge. The blade end widens from the axehead body and flares slightly at the lower blade. The colour of the metal is overall grey-green, which indicates a higher tin content; areas towards the blade end exhibit a high bronze-coloured patina. There is a small hole on one face near the blade which may be due to a casting bubble; it seems to perforate through the face and into the socket. It measures an overall 108.4 mm long, 54.86 mm maximum width at blade, 35.64 maximum outer width at socket mouth; the internal diameter of the socket is 26.9 mm and the depth of the socket is approximately 88 mm. The axehead weighs 209 grams.


Because of the socket orientation within the axehead, which is back to front, this example may be a smaller derivative of Sompting type axes.  According to Bronze Age specialist Dot Boughton, the facets indicate that this axehead should be dated to the Late Bronze Age rather than the Early Iron Age, which more typically has ribs instead of facets (pers. comm. 6/2012).","
This axehead was discovered within a short distance of Wolstonbury Hill, a well-known Bronze Age site. Within the axehead, cartridges were found which suggests perhaps that this object has been discovered previously and re-interred in nearby soil. It is therefore possible that this axehead comes directly from the Wolstonbury site. It was discovered by a Friend of Wolstonbury and reliquished to the Wolstonbury Trust for keeping as part of the collection.

The blade portion of the axe remains with the broken edge traversing the axe and revealing the tip of the socket. The blade cutting edge is asymmetrical, rounded and blunt, and is convex in plan. The blade has slightly flared sides, and on these side faces the casting seams are still evident. The break edge of the axe is not recent as there are traces of a patina on the break that matches the traces of dark green patina on the surface of the axe. The surface of the axe is abraded with only traces of a well developed patina.

502546,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-700,"Cast copper-alloy (bronze) tanged chisel of possible Middle - Late Bronze Age date (1500 - 750 BC). The identification of this object as a chisel as well as the dating criteria are rather tentative. The artefact is incomplete and poorly preserved. The metal surface is also irregular  being heavily cracked and laminated on one face and pitted  and abraded on the other - there is also a suggestion that it may have been miscast. All these elements make a positive dated identification difficult.



The chisel fragment comprises the upper part of the blade, side projections / trunnions / shouldered stop ridges, and the lower part of the tang; the tip of the tang and lower  blade / cutting edge are both lost. In plan the chisel is irregular, the upper blade is rectangular and the tang tapers to a blunted point. In section it is also irregular - the blade section is rectangular (slightly lentoid) in shape. In profile it is rectangular having its thickest part at the midpoint (corresponding with the position of the lug like projections / trunnions) tapering toward the tang and blade. The tang is incomplete and damaged; it has a relatively angular butt which expands to the mid point. It has lost approximately 1/5th of its length. The tip of the tang measures 10.6mm width and  9.1mm thick. At the mid point two irregular shaped - and relatively poorly cast - projections extend from either edge. These form shoulder like stops and are broadly triangular in plan and lentoid in section; being very crude in the casting. They are also eroded by plough roll / abrasion. The shoulder stops measure 12.7mm length are 9.4mm thick and project 6.3mm from the edge. The body of the chisel is thickest here - but there is no evidence of a stop ridge or median bevel. The upper body of the blade remains at the same thickness. It tapers slightly from the expanded stops. The long edges are of the chisel are heavily abraded and any sign of casting seams have been lost.  There is no cast or applied / punched / hammered decoration present on the artefact. It has a mid brown green coloured relatively thick patina which is abraded on all surfaces. Where abrasion has occurred some additional lamination is present, as well as distinct pock-marks and cracking of patina on both the upper and lower faces. The abraded areas are a mid - light green colour with relatively stable corrosion product present. One side is considerably uneven and irregular possibly suggesting that the chisel was poorly cast using an amalgam of metals. The break across the upper blade is patinated suggesting damage in antiquity. The surface patina on the better preserved face has a dull silver grey coloured sheen, often seen with high tin content bronzes from the very late Bronze Age and earliest Iron Age deposits (Llyn Fawr metalwork). A direct parallel has not been found for this chisel - it is much more crude then many tanged chisels of the Middle - Late Bronze Age.



The chisel measures: 72.6mm length, is 27.2mm wide across the stops and 22.6mm across the blade, and it is 11.9mm thick at the same point. It weighs 69.85 grams.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,69.85,,,11.9,72.6,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,,,,EATON,SJ5865,From finder,53.180432,-2.629899,HESH-BCF365,,HESHBCF365.jpg,Bronze Age: Chisel,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/yviea/HESHBCF365.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1022342.jpg
502551,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1150,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy plano-convex ingot, sub-triangular in plan and profile, and plano-convex in section. The fragment rises up from its semi-circular outer edge, which is about 10 mm in thickness, to the centre of the ingot, where it is broken, and 27 mm in thickness or height. The two sides which look deliberately waisted may have been filed after sections were taken out of the ingot, and have since worn smooth and corroded to form rounded yet defined rectangular edges. There are also a few pits in the base, side and upper surface, which were probably formed from air pockets during the casting process.


Caches of copper alloy ingots have been found in pottery vessels at sites such as Porthcothan in Cornwall, and fragments of ingots have been found in Late Bronze Age metalworker's hoards from St Erth and Tregonning, for example. These plano-convex ingots tend to date from the Late Bronze Age (c.1150-700 BC).

It has a rib along the centre on both faces, giving it a slightly lozenge shaped section. The end of the barb is rounded, as is the end of the surviving tang, though it is not clear if it is complete. The barb is half as long as the tang. The notch between the barb and tang has straight sides and a rounded end, but overall is fairly square and narrow (3.67mm wide at the widest point). The surface has a smooth golden brown patina which is well developed. There is some pitting which is green.


There are only 4 other Bronze Age flat, barbed and tanged arrowheads on the PAS database: NMS-F982A3, WMID-CE6A76, NARC-F9B223 and SF6680.


SF6680 notes that: ""Tanged (usually with barbs) copper-alloy arrowheads are known from the  late Bronze Age in Britain and western Europe (cf. Brendon O'Connor,  1980), though they are rare"" and provides four parallels from Suffolk:  ""tanged, from ERL 050; barbed and tanged, from LKH and MNL 333 (neither yet on SMR); and uncertain shape, from EXG Misc. (from LBA  hoard)"".  The record also cites examples from Norfolk: ""examples include one from  Hockwold, one from Methwold, and two of uncertain provenance.""


NARC-F9B223 records that: ""Dr. Colin Pendleton (SCCAS) notes that there is no reason to doubt that  these are contemporary with Early Bronze Age flint examples of similar  form.""


WMID-CE6A76 cites other examples ""illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of  British and European Prehistoric metalwork in Birmingham City Museums',  page 11, ref no 90, found in Britain but with no provenance, as well as  page 26, ref nos 328 (found at the Swiss Lakes; no provenance); 329  (found at Lake Neuchatel) and 330 (found at the Swiss Lakes: no  provenance)""


NMS-F982A3 cites Stuart Needham, who having examined a photograph, commented:




'It is interesting to learn of yet another of these arrowheads from  British soil. Many years ago I would have doubted the veracity of the  findspot, or suspected a collector's loss, However, there are now  sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard,  Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite  the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have  to be Early Bronze Age. Bronze barbed-and-tanged arrowheads in one guise  or another continue right through and my suspicion would be that most  finds are Middle to Late Bronze Age. The Penard example proved to have  an unusual metal composition suggestive of it being a foreigner.'",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2012-01-31T00:00:00Z,,,3.95,,,3.06,46.4,1,Carole Bloom,Carole Bloom,East Midlands,Lincolnshire,West Lindsey,Scotter,SE9000,Generated from computer mapping software,53.489024,-0.645021,SWYOR-3A2CF7,,PAS_1790_arrowhead.jpg,Bronze Age flat barbed and tanged arrowhead,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_1790_arrowhead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/383099.jpg

506476,Armlet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Description A crumpled and torn fragment of sheet gold with engraved geometric decoration comprising three bands of double zigzags separated by two plain zones; the zones are each bounded by three longitudinal engraved lines and the edges by four. The decoration is well executed. Two straight edges are present and these appear to be parallel.

Maximum dimensions: Length 25.5mm; Width 12.2mm; Thickness 0.1mm; Weight 1.35 grams. The width when intact would be approximately 22mm.

Analysis: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a fragment of sheet gold ornament with incised geometric decoration carried out by the British Museum's Department of Conservation and Scientific Research, indicated a gold content of 86-88%, a silver content of approximately 10-11%, the remainder being copper. The sheet fragment weighs 1.35 grams..

Identification: The parallel edges and orientation of the decoration indicate that this is not a lunula fragment. The restored width is more in keeping with an armlet. The best analogues are all copper alloy armlets belonging to Needham's Group 1 (Needham 2000, 29). These are penannular sheet metal bands, three of which are narrow and three broad. One of the former is plain but the other five have geometric decoration; the broader examples (27, 21 and 37mm) particularly bearing zones and panels of motifs resembling decoration on Beaker pottery; one of them, from Knipton in Leicestershire, was associated with a Beaker but not with human remains. Another from a Normanton barrow (Amesbury G41) was found on the arm of a skeleton (Waterman 1948, 180) but has no other associations. The Knipton Beaker is not amongst the earliest. The number of Group 1 armlets is small, and contextual information is scanty. Needham's assessment acknowledges the difficulties involved in establishing a chronology for his Groups 1 and 2 armlets. A date in the Early Bronze Age, not before circa 2200BC, appears likeliest at present.

511594,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-100,"A fragment from an unidentified cast copper-alloy object of a known type usually referred to as 'moustache-like' or 'moustache shaped'. These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead 1998; ref. 117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material. An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Robin Iles pers. comm. 9th July 2012; Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35).


The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper part. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the lower surface, which come to a halt about halfway along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminal plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end. Other hollow examples recorded on this database include: SUSS-3AEC48, WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. The opening is a maximum of 7.9mm long.


Due to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete. Based on other known examples (e.g. SF-520513) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original. The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle, with a hole through the centre of this bridge.

The blade portion of the palstave remains with the broken edge traversing the palstave. The broken edge is not too recent. The blade cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical, rounded, blunt, slightly abraded and is convex in plan. The blade has slightly flared sides. Both faces of the palstave has a slightly linear rib running along the length of the axe. The surface of the palstave is slightly abraded with only traces of a mid grey/green patina and a black deposit which is possibly carbon. From the cutting edge to the broken edge the palstave measures 35.98mm, and across the corners of the blade it measures 56.76mm wide and measures 11.61mm thick at the broken edge. It weighs 82.2g.

515883,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-800,"An almost intact cast copper alloy socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 800 BC). The axe is almost complete with just one corner of the cutting edge (blade tip) missing. The break is patinated and worn.


The axe is sub rectangular in plan, with the cutting edge   expanding outwards to form an convex cutting edge which is wider than the rest of the axe. The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 26.51mm,  internal length 22.33mm, external  width 37.8mm, external length 34.8 mm and the wall of the mouth is 5-6mm thick). The socket is 48.72mm deep and the insides are smooth. There is a moulded collar round the mouth. On the front and back of the axe, three faint ribs extend along the socket towards the blade. There is a plain gap between the start of the ribs and the mouth moulding of about 5-6mm. The ribs fade out before the sides of the axe start to expand to form the cutting edge. There is one rib along each side of the two main faces, and one along the centre. They are rounded in section. The front and back faces of the axe are very slightly faceted at the socket end, changing in angle at the central rib. The sides of the axe have a pronounced castling seam along the centre of each. The sides are also very slightly faceted, changing in angle at the seams. These slight facets make the socket sub octagonal in section. Both sides of the axe are sub triangular in plan with the apex of the   triangle  being the point of the blade. The blade is slightly  bevelled. The collar round the mouth is 7mm wide and the corners between  the front and back and sides of the axe are rounded.


One side of the axe exhibits a semi circular moulded side  loop (18.44mm  length, 8.6mm wide, 4.4mm thick and projects 7.8mm  away from the  surface of the axe), in parallel alignment to the blade.  The loop is placed low down, the upper end emerging from immediately below the collar. A  casting seam runs the  length of the axe from the  socket mouth to the side of the blade, and over the loop. The inside of the loop  exhibits another casting seam. The casting seams do not appear to have been completely  hammered, filed and smoothed. Between the loop and the blade, nearer the loop, is a small sub-circular hole through the wall of the socket. It appears to have been formed from the outside, as the sides of the hole are angled so the hole is bigger on the outside.


The axe is a mid green to dark brown colour, with an uneven surface patina and areas of roughness.  The original surface has been removed in a couple of areas.


A very similar axe is NMS-BE9687.


Peter Reavill comments that the axe fits with the Type Yorkshire (Schmidt and Burgess), which is a very large class starting in the Wiburton /  Wallington period into the Ewart Park phase. This fits with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about  1150-750 CAL BC.

Dot. Boughton, FLO for Lancs and Cumbria and specialist in Bronze Age metalwork, has kindly offered the following research:


""According to Burgess and Gerloff (Ref: Burgess, C. and Gerloff, S. 1981. The dirks and and rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland. Praehistorische Bronzefunde IV, 7. Munich) (pg. 19):

""Group II: Dirks and rapiers assigned to Group II have blades showing a central ridge which produces a distinctive flattened lozenge cross-section. The edges can be plain or bevelled. The blades are generally plain, only a very few examples having lateral grooves or decorative bands across thr butt-end of the median ridge. Generally butts are more or less trapezoidal and have two rivets in rivet-holes, only a few having an additional pair of side notches, indicating a hilt affixes by four rivets in the Continental manner....... Blades of Group II differ considerably and it is only possible to distinguish three clear-cut Types within the group, the basis of classification being the shape and proportions of butt and blade. The remainder are all obviously related to each other but do not form any homogenous types or are too damaged for further classification.....""




They carry on describing their first type, ""Blades with four rivet holes"": (p. 20) A few weapons of Group II have four rivet holes, a feature not characteristic of British dirks and rapiers and more commonly found on the Continent where four-riveted trapezoidal butts are associated with Tumulus Culture rapiers in south Germany as well as Wohlde dirks in the North.""


Burgess and Gerloff show three examples (nos 66-68) which are deescribed as possible imports from Northern Germany. No. 68 is especially similar to the one recorded here.


There is therefore a high likelihood that this dagger or, more accurately, dirk, is actually a Continental piece, possibly from Northern Germany or southern Scandinavia.


There is a similar dirk on thios website: http://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Siedlung/Siedlungsgeschichte/Bronzezeit/ 


Another more or less appropriate comparison is a dagger which is part of the hoard from Berlin-Spandau. Its origin is possibly southern Scandinavia, Schleswig-Holstein or Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Northern Germany). It shares the four rivets, semi-circular shoulders/butt end and gently curved blade. There is an image (figure) here: Abb. 1,7 in: Schwenzer, S. 1997. ""Wanderer, kommst du nach Spa..."". In: Haensel, B. and Haensel, A. (eds.) 1997: Gaben an die Goetter. Schaetze der Bronzezeit Europas. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Preussischer Kulturbesitz und Freie Universitaet, Seminar fuer Ur- und Fruehgeschichte, p. 61-67.


Generally speaking I think that this is an artefact of the Continental tumulus culture which is part of the Middle Bronze Age and the date is c. 1600-1200BC, probably more towards the beginning of it, i.e. 1600-1500BC"".


The length of the dirk is 165mm. At its widest the dirk is 35mm. The blade is 19mm wide before tapering to a point and 4mm thick at the central axis.","

516750,Axehead,Bronze Age,,,,,"I am grateful for the following description which was produced by John Llywellyn Williams.



The axe was discovered in 2012 and is an interesting example of a Bandon type Developed axe displaying some atypical features. Bandon axes are distinguished by their small size, a rectangular, slightly tapering parallel sided body, convex sides developing into low hammered side flanges, a faintly defined proto stop ridge and a sharp lower body flare expanding into a deep crescentic blade with pointed blade tips. This specimen corresponds in most of the listed attributes but differs in the following manner. A very faint outline of a stop ridge can be discerned on one face but, most importantly, the side flanges were formed on this same single face. The obverse face is featureless and therefore defeats the object of creating an efficient hafting facility on the axe. In this capacity the specimen may be considered as an unfinished object which leads to the question why it was discarded rather than being recycled. Although not analysed the most likely composition of the axe is bronze. The object was discovered during metal detecting by an employee of the landowner and the context of burial is therefore not known.



In the Welsh corpus of Developed axes there are nine Bandon and Bandon affiliated examples from Wales with four representatives from northern Wales, respectively Crug (Bethel), Caerwys (Flintshire), Overton, (Wrexham) and Rhuallt (Denbigh). The Crug axe, the nearest geographically to Llanfaglan, is closely similar but has an extended body and is characterised by panelling on the face a feature unique to this axe. The closest parallels to the Llanfaglan axe are two axes from south Wales, namely the small, slightly damaged example from Llanfabon (Nelson - Caerphilly) and the example from Penllyn near Bridgend, one of a small group which appear to be associated with the location of a former lake.



The dimensions of the axe are - length 81.23mm; blade width 48.60mm; butt width 21.87mm; maximum body thickness 11.97mm, weight 151.6 gms.



Developed flat axes belong to metalworking assemblage IV, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 3 and can probably be dated to the interval between circa 2000 and 1750BC.

518968,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-700,"A complete cast copper alloy (bronze) socketed axe of Late Bronze Age dating (950 to 700 BC).


The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge and the socket is sub-rectangular in cross section. The socket of the axe is sub-rectangular, with an irregular mouth. The top edge of the socket shows little evidence of casting jets that have been trimmed flush with the socket mouth. One of the four casting runners survives the extensive abrasion and can be clearly identified. The mould has slipped slightly during the casting process. The swollen moulded collar of the socket is relatively wide and varies in thickness along its length. At the base of the collar a small swollen rib extends. The loop is well preserved and relatively small and wide with a irregular lentoid shaped cross section. It is set in a low position on the axe being set beneath the collar in line with the horizontal moulding.The horizontal cast moulding is present on both faces and the edges of the axe; however this is better preserved on one face. From this moulding, on each face, three parallel longitudinal ribs descend. The ribs are complete and taper along their length terminating approximately in the middle of the axe. The two long sides of the axe expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade.The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion.


The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion. Here a dark green coloured metal can be seen. Some of this exposed metal has a light green powdery copper corrosion present. The areas worst affected are those around the collar, socket and cutting edge. These areas of exposed metal should be monitored for signs of active corrosion (bright greeny powdery residue). To reduce the risk of this occurring, the axe head should be stored in an dry acid-free environment, such as a sealed tupperware box, with silica gel and acid free tissue paper.


The axe measures 101.15mm in length, 45.20mm wide, is 38.55mm thick and weighs 185.7 grams. The depth of the socket is 75.94mm.


This axe fits into a well known distribution of ribbed axes present in the Northern Marches (Shropshire) and north and East Wales. It can be paralleled with a similar socketed ribbed axe from Breiddon Hillfort (Powys) which was discovered during excavations. This also had a portion of preserved willow haft which was radiocarbon dated to the period 754 ± 50 CAL BC(Musson 1991). This fits with the final phases of the Late Bronze Age specifically that associated with Ewart Park industrial phase. Similar discoveries of Socketed Axes (from which this example may be paralleled) can be seen in the Willow Moor Hoards (of 1790's and 1840's) from Little Wenlock, Shropshire (Chitty 1928). A similar axe was also discovered in a hoard of axes from Pencoyd, Herefordshire (2005-T412). This was also dated to the Ewart Park phase. These axes correspond in date with Needham's period 7 (Needham:1996) Very few Socketed axes have been discovered or reported from Shropshire in recent years so this example is particularly important to the understanding of Late Bronze Age Archaeology of the County.","

Dot Boughton comments: The patina and shape doesn't quite fit in with Late Bronze Age bag-shaped chapes and is more likely a chape of unknown or post-med date. Other Bronze Age bag-shaped chapes are just a bit more pointed at the top and they are often decorated with a groove or moulding or mouth moulding or even punched circlets, but this example is very plain.

Max. length 15.93mm; max. width 8.14mm; max. thickness 4.4mm; thickness of wire approx.. 0.62mm; weight 2.26 grams.



Both manufacturing technique and composition are consistent with a Bronze Age date, although precise analogues for the type are presently lacking. Gold ribbon ornaments are known from the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1300-1100 BC, but the ribbed effect is achieved here by grooving (cf the piece from Ilam, Staffs. (Treasure Annual Report 2005/6, 20, no.14). Solder is used at this date in the manufacture of other gold ornament types such as (probably) the pendant from Burton, where circular-sectioned wire has been spiralled to form the biconical element (Treasure Annual Report 2004, 198, no.485). In the same hoard was an unusual bracelet; the wires were here twisted and fixed at each end by flat rectangular terminals but also at intervals by solder. Solder was also frequently used in the making of Middle Bronze Age composite rings. Later during the Bronze Age the face-plates of lock rings were sometimes made from individual wires soldered together, a technique which may have originated in Ireland.



As the object is prehistoric and contains precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Designation Order 2002.

Dot Bruns comments:



""This is a fragment from either an Atlantic bucket, Danubian style series, Type Nannau-Dowris or a Hiberno-British bucket like the ones from Dowalton and Duddingston Loch, both in the National Museum in Edinburgh. These are nos 166 and 167 in Gerloff's catalogue respectively and the date is c. late Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork tradition, that is c. 1100-800BC. Gerloff does date the buckets into the Llyn Fawr period, but I am not sure what her evidence is - I certainly haven't seen any bucket fragments from EIA hoards or contexts and I have seen them if not all, then most of them I would say.""



""The loop on this example is not complete, i.e. 360 degrees. It is usually around 180-190 degrees and ridged like this example. The ridging derives from separately cast rings that were soldered together somehow - the later ones, like this example, only have ridges left. The ends of the 180/190 degree circle are attached to a staple/clamp which in turn clamps around the vessel opening/rim. The rim is usually rolled up or folded or strengthened with a rod (like in the example above) because usually, the handles were too fragile to lift a bronze bucket or cauldron, especially when it was filled/full. The sheet metal would rip and I think this is probably what happened in this example from Dowalton. There are other handles with handle attachments from hoards and buckets/cauldrons are incredibly rare.""","Gerloff, S. 2010. 'Atlantic cauldrons and buckets.

--



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a fragment of a penannular ring from Steyning, West Sussex, indicated a gold content of approximately 77-80%, a silver content of 16-18%, the remainder being copper. The analysis of one broken end detected mostly iron but with copper and tin. Iron is detected on this core and on the outer surface of the gold which would support the view that it is the result of contamination from the burial environment and that the core metal was copper alloy. The ring weighs 5.67 grams.

530709,Lunula,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2400,-2000,"The lunula is in two parts and nearly complete, only missing one of the circular terminals. The object is made of gold and so the precious metal content is more than 10%.



The lunula is semi-circular in plan although both parts have been folded. There is one part which does not have a terminal and it is this section which is less folded making the semi-circular shape more obvious. The widest section of the lunula is where the two pieces have broken apart and then the object tapers towards the terminals. The section which still has a circular terminal is more severely folded and there is a break in the object from the inner edge. The two sides are folded underneath themselves and there is also a folding which creates an acute angle. The lunula then flattens before turning so that the back of the terminal faces forward.



There is a border of five lines which run along the inner and outer edges of the object. From the inner most line there are a series of inwardly radiating lines which create small triangles on the border. As the object tapers towards the terminals there is more detailing which runs across the width of the object. The geometric design is maintained is lateral linear incisions interspersed with near perpendicular lines which create small triangles.



Finds of Bronze Age lunulae are very rare from Britain although they are a slightly more common find in Ireland. Examples from Britain are known from the West of the country, there are three in the National Museum of Scotland (X.FE.1, X.FE.3 and X.FE.4) which are from Western Scotland and one (X.FE.2) which was found in Northern Scotland. These lunulae are similar to this example in their decoration although the lunula from Morayshire (X.FE.2) has more rectangular terminals. There are also several Irish examples in the British Museum such as the Blessington lunula (WG.31) which again show the rounded terminals and the geometric incised decoration.



There is a lunula terminal recorded on the PAS database which is now in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle (LANCUM-449151). This example has a more rectangular terminal similar to the example in the National Museum of Scotland and again fits the more western distribution of objects of this type. The findspot of the lunula from East Yorkshire is extremely unusual.



Taylor (1970) has created three classes of lunula and this example is likely to be the provincial type similar to one from Wales in the British Museum (1869,0619.1). The provincial type of lunula is made of slightly thicker foil and is narrower than the classical type of which the Blessington lunula is an example.

Description



The greater part of a lunula in two pieces. The more complete (a) has a small, oval terminal which is missing from the other piece (b). The two portions are very crumpled and folded and it is difficult to tell whether any of the central part is missing.



(a): the oval terminal has a slender stem; this is the more damaged portion of the lunula being both crumpled and folded; it is also twisted at the horn tip. Weight: 40.39g.



(b): is less distorted and has a maximum surviving width of c 58mm. The thickness at the edge is c 0.2mm and averages at c 0.55mm centrally. Weight: 36.29g.



The total weight is 76.68g.



The horns are decorated, each bearing a panel of alternate plain and decorated zones of engraved geometric motifs. The edges of the whole are each outlined by five unevenly spaced engraved lines with a row of dentate decoration forming the inmost motif. The five lines reduce to three at the horn and to one at the horn tip.



The decoration of the horns is orientated across the width and comprises single rows of dentate motif (^) alternating with multiple engraved lines (-) and plain zones (P) following this regime: ^-^-^P^-^-^P^-



Identification



Lunulae are flat gold crescentic ornaments with spatulate terminals. According to Needham (2000) they may largely overlap primary Bell Beaker goldwork, c 2400-2000BC.



In Taylor's classification of lunulae (Classical, Unaccomplished and Provincial; Taylor 1970), the Thwing example falls within the Provincial group in terms of width, thickness and decoration. Classical lunulae are found chiefly in Ireland with three from Cornwall and two attributed to Scotland (Eogan 1994); Unaccomplished lunulae are exclusively Irish finds, while Provincial lunulae have been found in the highland zones of Britain and the western area of the European continent. An occurrence in East Yorkshire is thus outside the expected distribution.



As the items are gold and datable to the Early Bronze Age they qualify as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.

530761,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1250,-800,"A fragment from a cast blade, of Middle Bronze Age dating (c. 1250 BC to c. 800 BC).


The blade fragment is sub trapezoidal in plan, and sub rectangular in section. The remains of a circular rivet hole is present at the top of the fragment. The remnants of the original plan surface (concave, narrowing towards the edge) is located along the left hand side of the fragment.


The fragment measures 33.70 mm in length, 34.04 mm wide and 3.10 mm thick. It weighs 12.6 grams.


The fragment is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina.


The shape of the fragment, including the original bladed edge is suggestive that this fragment may have originally been part of a dagger or a rapier. However due to the size of the fragment, this identification is only a possibility.


Comment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): One edge has been broken to form a trapezoidal shape  as these things normally have two rivet holes both on the upper edge in the corners. I think from the pictures one is good for the original edge - the other is happenstance and where the second hole should be is lost - or deliberately cut down for an unknown reason - it looks deliberately thinned in section - it may have been cut down to form another object - possibly a razor.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-09-08T23:00:00Z,,,,12.6,,,3.1,33.7,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Myddle and Broughton,SJ4423,Generated from computer mapping software,52.801635,-2.832069,WMID-A3EDA5,,WMID-A3EDA5.jpg,WMID-A3EDA5: Middle Bronze Age: Dagger / Rapier blade fragment,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID-A3EDA5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/404756.jpg
530777,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"An incomplete cast copper alloy, probable flat axe, of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2250 BC to c. 1900 BC).


The fragment is sub rectangular in plan and section. One end tapers to a point and is sub circular in shape. The edges of the fragment gradually taper outwards and the fragment develops a square cross section. An old break is present across the top of the fragment.


The fragment measures 50.84 mm in length, 25.09 mm wide and has a maximum thickness of 8.38 mm. It weighs 41.0 grams.


The fragment is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of the majority of the original surface and detail. The patina has flaked away in a couple of areas, leaving a lighter green area. These areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (a bright green powdery residue) occurring. To reduce the risk of this happening, the fragment should be stored in a sealed dry, air tight environment, such as a tupperware box lined with acid free tissue paper and silica gel.


This fragment is probably the butt of a late flat axe something like a type Migdale or Type Alyesford which may or may not have a proto stop ridge or slight raised side flanges, although it may have possibly been developed into a long flanged axehead. These are of Early Bronze Age dating .


Comment from Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire): Although incomplete this axe best fits into the final phases of the Migdale metalworking tradition Type: Migdale - decorated variant. However, it does share some of the characteristics (mostly of blade shape) of the Developed Flat Axes specifically variants Falkland and Scrabo Hill. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL.

It fits into the Taunton Metalwork assemblage. The sides of the butt expand into two prominent flanges, each a pointed oval shape viewed from the side. The blade expands into a crescent shaped cutting edge, one tip of which has broken off and is missing.  The cutting edge has a blade facet, and rows of hammer marks are visible on the rest of the blade. The point between the butt and the blade (the stop) is the thickest point of the axe, but the change of angle here is very slight and there is no obvious stop ridge; the flanges extend slightly beyond this point. There is a slight ridge or nick across each side face at the end of the flanges. visible in plan view. The butt tapers from 14.85mm thick at the stop , to 3.3mm at the butt. The internal measurement between the flanges is about 17 at the base and 19mm at the top of the flanges. The flange sides are slightly convex, but the blade sides are straight. The axe has a smooth, dark green patina with a few scratches and gouges. It is 124.2mm long, 56.5mm wide and 28.6mm thick. It weighs 396gm.

A late Bronze Age axe of plain Southeastern type. The loop and collar are missing and the casting seams are filed smooth. The socket extends below a constriction into a void which fills the interior of the blade. This has resulted in distortion of the blade, which has split across its width, leaving one side of the blade bending outwards. The void within the blade appears to be a casting accident when, perhaps, part of the central core dislodged during casting. A similar feature was noted on a socketed axe found in a hoard of axes at Woodcote, south London.

The three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham, hoard are similar in form, size and weight to the Salthouse bead (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts (including bronze palstaves) that allow it to be dated to c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid.). The bead is also similar to those from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire and Harlow, Essex, the former from a stratified Middle Bronze Age context (Varndell 2000, 12, no.1; 2005/6, 17, 270, no.6), and Buriton, Hampshire (HAMP-72E451).



Middle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al. forthcoming) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Smith 1959; Roberts 2007).

A large fragment of an Early to Middle Bronze Age copper alloy flanged axe comprising the blade and part of the body. The flaring blade with a wide crescentic edge is in good condition and remains sharp.  The axe is pitted and the casting seams have been removed.


The wide crescentic edge is typical of the Arreton developed axes and the  crispness of the flanges would suggest that they are cast rather than  raised with a hammer.

543245,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"A cast copper-alloy unlooped long flanged axehead, damaged and dating to the middle Bronze Age, c. 1600-1400 BC.



The axe is complete, but the edges of the flanges, butt, and blade are damaged with missing nicks and bending between the nicks. The blade flares slightly from the flanges and a very worn stop-ridge, with a crescentic edge at its end. The butt is rounded in profile. In plan view, the flanges are lozengiform, and the axe is probably related to the shield-pattern early types of Long flanged axhead dating from either Acton Park I or II industrial phases of metalwork.

543911,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-900,-750,"A fragment of Late Bronze Age tanged chisel, dating to the Ewart Park phase, c.900-750 BC. It is missing its tang above its collar. It measures 43.26x28.31x10.47mm and weighs 24.93g.

The collar is sub-rectangular in cross-section (11.28x10.36mm) with rounded corners and c.5mm high. To one side projects a very worn stump, the remains of the tang, measuring 6.96x6.15mm. Below is an oval-sectioned neck, expanding from 7.68x6.19mm to 9.01x6.04mm, where it extends into an expanding bell-shaped chisel-end. The nearest (top) edge of this is curved, as in the curved top of a bell, and is slightly thicker than the neck above (6.40mm max.thickness). This narrows to 1.37mm thick at the cutting edge. In shape, the sides curve gently outwards then inwards, with the cutting edge itself flaring outwards again at the very end. The actual edge has a slight curve though is mostly straight.

The object has a smooth blue-green patina with some light surface scratches. Its bell-shaped chisel-end is very similar to WILT-846EE0 from Cricklade, North Wiltshire.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2012-06-30T23:00:00Z,2012-07-30T23:00:00Z,,,24.93,,,10.47,43.26,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South East,Hampshire,Winchester,Corhampton and Meonstoke,SU6120,Centred on parish,50.97618978,-1.13251423,HAMP-3CDA23,,HAMP-3CDA23.jpg,Late Bronze Age tanged chisel,Winchester Museums Service,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP-3CDA23.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/415161.jpg
