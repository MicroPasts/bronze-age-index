926828,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1020,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy narrow rapier, rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in profile and section, with a raised broad mid-rib on both faces. The surface is heavily pitted and corroded on one side so that less of the dark brown patina survives. The cutting edges of the fragment are also jagged and damaged. The fragment dates from the Middle Bronze Age, but to be sure of its date, it will need more metallurgical analysis.



Rohl and Needham (1998) illustrate some similar rapiers with broad mid-ribs on p.132, fig.34, nos.189-190, which are Group IV rapiers, and date from the Penard phase of metalwork, c.1275-1150 BC. 



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate rapiers with narrow blades and broad mid-ribs from Sennen in Cornwall and Exmouth in Devon on p.98, pl.25, nos.71 & 134.



Dr Matt Knight's research has suggested that rapiers carried on in use over longer periods of time where early swords did not develop. This is true of Scotland, but also of the South West so it is possible to suggest that rapiers continued to be used in these areas into the Wilburton (c.1150-1020 BC) phase of the late Middle Bronze Age (Matt Knight pers comm).",,4,Copper alloy,,Undergoing further examination at a museum,Metal detector,2018-09-12T23:00:00Z,2018-09-12T23:00:00Z,,,31.39,,,5.5,75,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Gweek,SW7026,Generated from computer mapping software,50.08948628,-5.21680296,CORN-0A6EBC,,rapier.JPG,Group IV rapier fragment (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/rapier.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1034885.jpg
926829,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1850,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy flat axehead, comprising part of the blade, trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile and rectangular in section, at the narrow broken end, dating from the Early Bronze Age c.2200-1850 BC.. The opposite blade end tapers to a rounded and damaged edge in profile which may have expanded outwards to form the cutting edge. The blade is broad and straight sided but as it is worn and incomplete, may have expanded into a more crecentic cutting edge. The surface of the blade is covered with a brown patina and both faces are decorated with straight lines punched into the axe after casting, about 5mm in length, and about 1mm apart, in what is referred to as a 'rain pattern'. One face of the blade has a transverse gash where it has been damaged since deposition, which cuts through the outer layer, revealing the light green corroded surface beneath which is also exposed on parts of the edges. The blade may have been deliberately broken at the upper edge, before it thickens and potentially flanges outwards towards the butt end, as the break is straight and may have been struck with a chisel prior to deposition as it is now corroded and worn.



Comparable examples of decorated flat axeheads with more spaced out linear incisions from the Southwest can be found in Pearce (1983) on a Migdale flat axehead from Southleigh in Devon (pp.455 & 600, pl.39, no.297) and a low-flanged flat axehead from Mount Pleasant in Dorset (pp.468 & 609, pl.48, no.371). See also record CORN-C53643 where the decoration covers the whole axe and is more regular and evenly spaced like this example and the developed flat axehead from Preston Down, Weymouth (pp.487 & 621, pl.60, no.480).



Flat axes decorated with this 'rain pattern' without flanged sides can be found during the Mile Cross-Aylesford phase (c.2050-1850 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axes illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 124, fig.25, nos.47-48).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar flat axeheads with rain patterns from Colleonard Farm, Banffshire, Scotland in pl.16, nos.199 & 202 which are classified as Type Migdale, Decorated Variant, and dated from the Migdale metalworking tradition (c.2200-1950 BC), and a similar concentrated pattern on a developed flat axehead from Middleton-on-the-Wolds, Yorkshire in pl.27, no.310, which is classified as Type Aylesford and dated from the Mile Cross-Aylesford metalwork phase (c.2050-1850 BC) of the Early Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Undergoing further examination at a museum,Metal detector,2018-09-24T23:00:00Z,2018-09-24T23:00:00Z,,,75.36,,,9,47,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,St. Erth,SW5732,Generated from computer mapping software,50.13817856,-5.40203551,CORN-0AB468,,DSCN6966.JPG,flat axehead (decoration),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN6966.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1035195.jpg

The sides of the axe were once straight but are now abraded and taper towards the narrow butt end which is worn to almost a point. The surface of the roughout has developed a dark brown patina and the sides have exposed the light green corrosion product beneath through wear and damage since deposition.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar rough flat axes with narrow butt ends and straight sides from Birnie, Morayshire and Angus in Scotland in plate 21, nos.258-259, which are unclassified but close to Type Migdale associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition c.2200-2000 BC of the Early Bronze Age.



Needham (2017) illustrates a similar axe-like blank or ingot on page 61, no.119 which are found within the Irish flat axe corpus but are more crudely shaped ingots in the flat axe form, presumably created in an open mould but perhaps incomplete.","Material has been drilled out of the side of the axehead for analysis by the finder which was analysed by Dr Jens Andersen of Camborne School of Mines using the Scanning Electron Microscope.

927674,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1150,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy side-looped palstave, with just the upper butt end that would have been hafted remaining. The fragment is broken just above the stop ridge which would have stopped the wooden haft on both sides, and is missing its blade so it is difficult to classify, but from the shape and the side loop it likely dates from the Penard phase (c.1275-1150 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age. The broken edge is rectangular in section with the bases of the worn flanges, 4 mm in height, on both sides of the palstave and the butt is narrow and parallel-sided blade between these flanges in plan. The flanges taper as they move towards the butt end where they are flush with the surface. The blade would have expanded slightly below the missing stop ridge and terminated in a crescentic blade edge. The remains of half of the side loop project outwards 9 mm from the surface of one side of the palstave and the loop is 15 mm long. The surface of the blade is damaged and pitted but some smooth layers of mid-green patina have developed and there are patches of light green bronze disease.



If the stop ridge was squared off, perpendicular to the parallel-sided low flanges, then this butt end was probably part of a side-looped Transitional Type palstave, but we do not know if the blade was plain or decorated.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar palstaves with low side flanges, parallel sides and squared-off stop ridges from Yorkshire and Denwick in Northumberland in plates 62 & 64, nos.859 & 880, which are classified as Transitional Palstaves and dated from the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age.

The spearhead has a short but slender kite-shaped blade with rounded shoulders. The edges are bevelled and the blade is still very sharp. Fine filing or polishing striations can be seen all over both sides of the blade. The socket is circular and tapers from the open mouth in to the shaft between the blade's wings. There are two lozenge-shaped, undrilled 'loops' located equidistantly between the socket mouth and the blade. The mouth of the socket has slight damage in three areas, and a small hole (a casting flaw?) can be seen below one of the 'loops'. There are fine linear filing or finishing striations all over the length and circumference of the socket. These lines have been created by filing from opposing angles which has created triangular and cross-hatched patterns. Around the 'loops' are striations that follow the shape of each lozenge and overlies the cross-hatching, showing the filing of the loops was one of the last processes to be undertaken. Overall the spearhead is in extremely good condition. It appears to have no wear on it and it is possible it was made to be a votive deposit rather than a functional item.

A small number of similar spearheads with undrilled loops have recently been recorded from across Oxfordshire; from Kingston Bagpuize (BERK-5BCE29), from Cherwell (BERK-D20304), Bampton (BERK-44F126) and another example found in AD 1871 in Fyfield now in the Ashmolean Museum (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706).

In plan it is broadly triangular with straight sides tapering to a rounded, but now abraded point. It is very flat in cross section. The hilt end is badly damaged with the outer corners and the central tang all broken. The break has occurred across the three circular rivet holes, approximately 8.5mm in diameter, one on each corner, and the other in the centre of the tang. This one is positioned slightly further down into the hilt than those on the outer corners. These positions suggest that the tang was slightly convex in shape. One of the side rivets remains in situ, with the other two found loose nearby.



The rivets are circular in cross section with expanded convex heads at either end, and vary in length from 14.4mm - 14.9mm, and in width from 9.8mm - 10.5mm. The weight of the two detached rivets, 5.60g and 5.15g.

932122,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1800,-1400,"A fragment from a Bronze age copper-alloy artefact, probably a dirk (dagger/knife) of middle Bronze Age date. This fragment weighs 25.20g and is from the distal butt-end of the blade. The fragment has a pointed-oval to shallow lozenge shaped cross-section and all of the edges are worn. The fragment has an incomplete length of 38.6mm, maximum width of 35.1mm at approximately 20.6mm in from the butt-end and maximum thickness of 4.6mm. The butt-end is a relatively straight line with rounded corners and width of 29.5mm. The fragment's sides angle inwards, tapering towards, the now missing, blade tip. The blade has a, slightly diagonal, very worn transverse break and a width of 23.2mm. The break of slope on the change of angle along the edges, on both sides, of the blade is c.8.5mm in from the edges. Two circular rivet holes are present at the butt-end. One is positioned 4.5mm in from the butt-end and 1.9mm in from the side edge. This aperture has a diameter of 6.9mm. The other rivet hole is positioned 6.9mm in from the butt-end and 0.8mm in from the side edge. Being so close to the edge the metal between the aperture and edge has broken and the metal has pulled apart, one break above the other, creating a gap of 0.6mm. A rivet remains in place through this hole. The rivet has a sub-circular cross-section with a diameter of 6.5mm, which fits securely into the aperture, and length of 11.1mm. The rivet has a shallow domed head which expands slightly from the diameter of the shaft, probably due to being hammered on both sides to secure the rivet in place thus to hold the blade to the hilt. The head has a more oval diameter of 7.1mm x 6.4mm the head at the other end of the rivet measuring 7.1mm x 6.9mm. Peter Reavill suggests that the condition of the mushroom headed rivets is likely to indicate that the hilt was still attached to the blade when it went into the ground.

The axe has a square, collared socket, from which two faces angle inwards, widening at the point at which they meet to form a slightly curved cutting edge. The mouth has a double collar moulding, the upper one more pronounced. There is a D-shaped loop springing from the lower collar on one of the triangular side faces. There are three ribs spaced evenly but closely across the front, and three on the back face, extending approximately halfway down the face. A casting seam is visible along both side faces, and there are the stubs of four casting jets, one on each edge of the mouth, with internal casting seams down the centre of the front and back faces of the axe. The cutting edge is extensively chipped, showing light green metal beneath the smooth blueish green patina. It is 80.29mm long, 40.61mm high, 37.37mm wide and weighs 216g. The socket is 59.6mm deep, 27.8mm wide internally.

The arrowhead has considerable abrasion and loss to the blade edges and tip, however it is clearly of triangular form. The cross sectional profile is flat, slightly elliptical but without a prominent midrib. The trapezoidal tang is splayed and relatively wide (6.5mm) compared to the overall width of the head (12.6mm).","The only example of this type of bronze arrowhead from a securely dated archaeological context comes from the Penard hoard (c. 1275-1140 BC) and was published in Archaeologica 71 (p. 138). At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import on the basis of a range of previous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France. PAS recorded finds have since demonstrated that these bronze arrowheads were also a native British tradition, although they are very rare finds. Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age, the Penard find suggests at least a Middle Bronze Age date for copper alloy examples such as this one which likely derive their shape from these earlier flint precursors.

Description: The fragment survives only as the cutting edge and part of the long rectangular socketed body. The cutting edge survives intact, albeit heavily worn. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips flare slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible . The axehead is patinated a mid green and the breaks have lead to more extensive corrosion.

933886,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"An incomplete copper-alloy side-looped spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1550 - 1125 BC. It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). 



The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced triangular cross-sectioned mid-rib on both faces, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. The edges of the blade are irregular and highly fragmentary due to corrosion. Some trace of edge bevels are discernable along parts of the blade edge, but it is hard to distinguish these from areas of corrosion. At the base of the blade is a socket, which is rectangular in plan, circular in cross-section, and is hollow, with no trace of wood remaining inside. Corrosion has created several holes in the sides of the socket. The socket has cast side loops roughly half way along its length, which are fragmentary.



The spearhead is green and brown in colour and in poor condition. All surfaces of the object are pitted and have copper disease, and the edges of the object are very fragile. The spearhead is 154.1mm in length, 35.9mm in width, 22.3mm thickness, and weighs 102.2g. 



This object corresponds closely with Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'. For this group, the most numerous of all Early and Middle Bronze Age spearheads, Davis suggests a chronology corresponding with the Acton Park and Taunton phases, about 1550 - 1250 BC.

The spearhead has a leaf shaped blade, with a pronounced and rounded midrib ridge which runs to the tip of the spear. The tip is now worn and broken, as are the edges of the blade. The blade and midrib cross section is lozenge shaped. The socket is circular in cross section and hollow.



The loops are about half way down the socket of the spearhead, these are formed of a narrow rectangular loop plate on both sides. The loops are D shaped in cross section, with an oval perforation. Running along the edges close to the loops are raised casting seams. The socket flares out towards the terminal edge, which is now worn and broken. One part has been folded inwards, and another part is folded outwards.



The spearhead has a dark green patina, with small circular patches of light green on the surface. At the socket end there is traces of orange brown on the surface. The spearhead measures 101.3mm in length, 22.4mm in maximum width, 17.8mm in maximum thickness and weighs 57.51g.

934089,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe dating from about 2000-1700 BC. The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side view of the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. 



In cross section the body of the axe is H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been raised by hand hammering to form slight flanges. The flanges appear to have been cast and probably augmented by hammering. On both faces of the axe there is a slight bump / rib / proto-stop ridge, where the butt and the blade meet and the face of the axe changes angle. The thickness of the axe across the flanges is 12.6mm and the septum is 10.2mm thick at the proto-stop-ridge. There is no decoration present and the casting flanges have been trimmed filled and hammered flat.



The blade tip flares outwards from the body. One edge is angled outward, and the other is a concave curve. There is no obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge, although it does tapers giving a slightly blunt edge.



The surface of the axe has a well-developed dark green to dark grey patina. It is 92.8mm long, 43.1mm wide and 12.6mm thick. 108.1g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III), of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC.



The axe seems similar to some Brandon types. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. This example does not have a particular flared cutting blade.

The flanges are slightly damaged along the topmost edge on both sides, with pitting on the outward facing sides of each flange. Immediately below the stop ridge is a shield shaped depression. The blade has inward-bowing sides which flare towards the blade which terminates in a convex cutting edge, now heavily abraded. There is a vertical casting seam along each long edge, tool-marks indicating that this was filed down during finishing.

934943,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1200,"A complete, copper alloy, Later Short Flanged axehead of the Lisset Type, dating to the middle Bronze Age, BC 1300-1200.



The axe head is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrowed square butt end which has been slightly damaged with some jagged edges. The lozenge-shaped flanges start a short way in from the butt corners; all of the flanges have been slightly bent backwards. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body. There is no obvious stop ridge for the handle to butt against although there is a not very pronounced curved stop on the main body just above the lower end of the wings. The blade is thicker than the septum and tapers in thickness to the crescent shaped blade with slightly upturned points. The edge of the blade is slightly chipped on one side. There are rough casting seams down the sides of the object from the pointed apex of the flanges to the points of the blade. There is no evidence of any decoration on the axe head. The patina is generally of a dark green colour with some dark brown patches.



Length: 129.5 mm

Width: 36.94 mm

Thickness: 14.4 mm

Weight: 305 g



Several examples of flanged axe heads can be found on the database although the types differ with small changes in shape, the closest parallel being LANCUM -F0B1FD which states that ""This is quite a large, common group and part of the Taunton Metalwork Assemblage, dating from c. 1300 - 1200 BC"". This axehead thus belongs to a group of Later Short Flanged axes, Lissett Type (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981,100;  plate 48, numbers 616-620).

935731,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A near complete copper alloy Middle Bronze Age dirk (small rapier) dating to the period c.1500 - 1150 BC found in 4 adjoining pieces.



The butt exhibits a series of old breaks along the lower edge which is convex curved and widens out to a maximum of 16.7 mm in width. It then tapers inwards to form two C-shaped notches on either side which are the remains of two broken rivets holes used as the attachment point for the missing handle. Both rivets are missing, and the holes are too fragmented to accurately estimate their diameter.



From these rivet holes the sides of the rapier expand into the shoulders of the blade. The maximum width of these shoulders is 27.1mm. From the shoulders the edge of the rapier narrows into the blade. From this point the blade itself tapers in width more gradually to almost have straight edges towards the end of the blade, the tip of which is missing. The blade is pointed oval in cross-section with no clearly defined mid-rib or edge bevels.



The object has a dark green patina which is particularly thick on the blade close to the rapier's shoulders. On the hilt area are concreted deposits which may be the remains or organic material preserved by copper salts. The majority of the blade's edge on all fragments shows chips, notches and damage but these may be due to post depositional damage. The maximum surviving width of the blade from midrib to edge is 17.1mm and it is maximum thickness is 7mm.



The longest fragment of the blade is bent so that it now forms a gentle curve when viewed in profile. The bending of the blade this way, and the snapping of it, into multiple fragments may have been deliberate although the fragments were found together and still fit together.



The total length of the rapier measures 184.9mm while the surviving portion of the blade is 157.9mm long. Both these figures would have been longer if the longest section of the blade were not bent. The blade has a maximum width of 4.7mm and a minimum width of 2.1mm. It minimum thickness is 1.96mm and its maximum thickness is 6.8mm. The rapier weighs 29.35g.



The object is likely a Group IV blade, with a comparable example no.864 from Undley, Suffolk (Burgess and Gerloff 1981, Plate 107). Close parallels include SOM-EECC89, a complete GLO-036A39 and pieces of two further such implements SUR-A18104/Treasure case 2015 T331. All of these rapiers are of similar form, being of Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV (1981) and dating to the period c. 1500-c. 1150 BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2018-09-05T23:00:00Z,2018-12-06T00:00:00Z,,,29.35,,,6.8,184.9,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South West,Somerset,Sedgemoor,Middlezoy,ST3834,From finder,51.10193381,-2.88687454,SOM-71AABB,,SOM71AABBsection.jpg,Later Bronze Age rapier,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM71AABBsection.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1045077.jpg
935732,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1250,"An incomplete cast copper alloy leaf-shaped basal-looped spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500 - 1250 cal BC) probably Ehrenberg Class IIIa.



The spear has a sub-circular socket which tapers to a lozenge midrib with rounded ridges on the blade. The internal diameter of the socket is 17.9mm. The socket appears to be filled with concreted material, possibly organic 'fossils' imbuded with copper alloy salts..



The spear's blade is leaf-shaped (a stretched oval) and has narrow incorporated loops with flat plates, with no decoration, on either side at the base of the blade. A large proportion of the spear is covered in a green and brown copper corrosion and concreted material however enough of the blade is visible to discount the presence of channels along the spear. There also appear to be no defined edge bevels although the edges are sharp. The tip of the spear is broken off about 82.2mm from the base of the blade. The edges of the blade at the break are very chipped and fragmented. The break is unworn but patinated.



The concreted material on the surfaces appears to be organic material that was adjacent to the blade when deposited and has become concreted to it with the organics becoming imbuded with metal salts and preserved as 'fossils'.



Length 133.8mm, midpoint at 42.22mm from base of blade width 34.1mm, thickness 22.0. The midrib at the break at the tip end is 10.1mm thick and 6.6mm wide. The diameter of the socket mouth is between 20.3mm and 22.41. It weighs 91.58 grams.



The spear tip's poor preservation makes it difficult to precisely identify the length of the blade. If its tip was near the broken end of the spear the point of the blade's maximum width would lie between 40% and 50% of the blade as measured from its blade/socket junction. This would define the spear as a Davis type 2 (2006, 26). However, it is also possible that the blade extended further, or even became concave in form, which would change the classification of this blade to either the flame (type 3) or ogival (type 4) form respectively. The lozenge shaped midrib with its rounded corners would be consistent with these classes (Davis 2006, 33)



Regardless Davis's review of the dating evidence (ibid. p.49) concluded that, Type 2 and 3 'originated in the Acton park phase, and had its main period of use in the Taunton phase' (ibid. p.50), so around c.1500-1250 cal BC. However, there is also a limited amount of evidence to suggest that a few spearheads were in use beyond this period into the late Bronze Age, perhaps passed down from generation to generation as heirlooms (ibid.).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2018-09-05T23:00:00Z,2018-12-06T00:00:00Z,,,91.58,,,22,133.8,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South West,Somerset,Sedgemoor,Middlezoy,ST3834,From finder,51.10193381,-2.88687454,SOM-71B58D,,SOM71B58D.JPG,Bronze Age Basal looped spear head,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswell99/SOM71B58D.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1045033.jpg

936844,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A complete, Late Bronze Age penannular ring (or lock-ring) made from decorated gold sheet around a copper alloy core. The ring is oval in plan with a triangular cross-sectional profile. The face has a pronounced midrib and eight smaller concentric ribs running around either side of the face (17 ribs in total) suggesting construction from gold wire, in contrast to the gold sheeting of the inner surface and terminals which is flat and undecorated. The opening in the ring has been damaged, with the gold plate broken to reveal the corroded copper alloy core. One of the terminals has split and been pushed back inside the ring, with the sheeting ruptured; there is additional crushing damage to one side of the ring which has ruptured the sheeting on the inner surface.



Length: 19.6mm; width: 17.1mm; thickness: 5.2 mm; weight: 3.66g","These types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC). They belong to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings', 'ring-money' or 'lock-rings' but whose function remains uncertain. They may have been personal adornments worn on the ears or nose, rather than items of exchange. A closely similar example in size and construction in the British Museum's Greenwell Collection (WG 20) was found at Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland.

Conclusion: The item comprises more than 10% precious metal and is dated at over 300 years old at the time of finding.

937125,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1000,800,"A gold lock-ring and three small fragments of gold. The lock-ring is decorated with a series of incised concentric lines. One edge of the lock-ring is broken in a ragged edge, the other follows a neat line that may represent the original edge or a cut mark. The lock-ring is in a moderate condition, with cuts and distortion across its faces. There is evidence of tubing holding the two faces together (this has lifted in one section to reveal this construction technique). Around 1 quarter of the object is now missing and it is unclear from the initial inspection whether the small gold fragments form part of the broken edge or whether they are remains of other elements within the lock-ring construction. More investigation of this piece is required.

Scientific Analysis

Analysis was carried out by the Department of Scientific Research at The British Museum. 

Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis indicated a surface composition of approximately 80-82% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being copper. 

Discussion

This Late Bronze Age gold &lsquo;lock-ring&rsquo; dates to the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC). Lock-rings are known in relatively small numbers from Ireland, Britain and western France (Eogan 1969). A small number of examples are known from the North of England and the South of Scotland (see Eogan 1994, figure 41). Most of the finest examples have been found in Ireland. The find from &lsquo;Near Errington&rsquo; is a fine example of its kind and, despite its moderate condition, deserves to be acquired and studied in further detail. 

Conclusion

Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",,3,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2019-01-27T00:00:00Z,,2019T94,,2.62,,29.62,2.86,,1,,Andrew Agate,North East,Northumberland,Northumberland,Wall,NY9672,,55.04249122,-2.06412989,NCL-066786,,DDS_0017_1.jpg,,Tyne and Wear Museums,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/andyagate/DDS_0017_1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1051669.jpg

937607,Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1150,43,"A complete cast copper alloy heavy duty ring probably dating from the late Bronze Age to Late Iron Age (c. 1150 BC - AD 43). The ring is circular in plan sub-circular in section. The inside of the ring has what appears to be file marks or possibly scratches resulting from use, however these markings do not cover the entire inner surface. A couple of sections are smooth like the outside, which may suggest the presence of a strap. One area of the ring is slightly thinner than the rest; again a possible indication of use. The ring is undecorated but it has a beautiful green-brown patina which, when compared to other typologically and chronologically distinctive artefacts from the same area, suggests a Bronze Age or Iron Age date. It has an internal diameter of 27.6mm.



Similar rings have been discovered in a number of Bronze Age hoards and have been suggested to be horse harness fittings, part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron (Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg types; Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g), or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire.

937649,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead dating from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age (c.800-700 BC). The collar and the upper half of the axe is missing and there three fragments of more of the wall of the axe that also survive. The lower half that survives is sub-rectangular in plan, triangular in profile and the socket is almost square in section. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The sides of the axehead are straight and almost parallel but expand slightly towards the blade making the cutting edge a little crescentic, which is probably the result of sharpening during use. The cutting edge is also slightly damaged although this appears to be limited to the surface corrosion and is more likely the result of soil movement and of agricultural equipment since depostion than of use. A longitudinal linear casting seam is visible on one side but the other side is pitted and more worn. Most of the surface is oxidized to a pale green with a few patches of dark green patina.



The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).

The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which shows marks of hammering. On both sides there is a thin median rib from the stop ridge to the blade facet.



The object is an early/primary looped palstave (group III) with a mid-rib, dating to the Acton Park II to Taunton to early Penard phase of metalwork (1450 - 1200 BC). The blade facet shows ripples from the metal being drawn down through hammering to sharpen the blade. The surface of the rest of the blade, on all four sides, has many small indents that appear to be decorative.



The patina of the axe is almost complete. One face of the axe has a distinctive light blue to turquoise colour while the other is a darker green. The break appears old and has developed a green patina. The surface of the break is pitted and has several deep indents, formed by air bubbles in the alloy as the object was being cast.



A similar object is illustrated in Rowlands 1976 Fig 3, Plate 54 (Eglesham Meadows hoard).



Overall length 95.4 mm. Width at butt 23.4 mm, at blade 63.7 mm. Thickness 31.3 mm at stopridge, tapering to 1.0 mm at blade edge.

939314,Bead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"A gold biconical bead of 8.4mm diameter, with slightly dished, concave faces and a central hole 2.5mm in diameter. The inner surface of the hole is rough and there is a visible casting flaw within the interior. The solidity of the bead and the rough cylindrical interior of the central hole suggests that the method of manufacture was casting rather than construction from sheet metal.



Diameter: 8.4mm, thickness / height: 6.3mm, weight: 1.88g.","This bead is likely to date to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC) based on comparanda from the database (NMS-AEC678 (2013T20), HAMP-72E451 (2011T526), PAS-65902F (2015T175) and GLO-46CA05 (2014T358)) and various other excavated examples from stratified contexts (as quoted in these PAS records). Such Middle Bronze Age gold beads are a relatively rare find (Murgia et al.) and can be contextualised with reference to the so-called 'ornament horizon(s)', which see a proliferation of bronze and gold ornaments in Southern England and Britain (respectively) during the period c.1400-1100 BC (Roberts, 2007).



Conclusion: The object contains more than 10% precious metal and is of prehistoric date. Consequently, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 and the 2002 Treasure Designation Order, in terms of both age and precious metal content.",3,Gold,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2019-01-27T00:00:00Z,,2019T138,,1.88,,8.4,6.3,,1,Simon Maslin,Simon Maslin,South East,Hampshire,Basingstoke and Deane,Overton,SU5049,From finder,51.23799766,-1.28516994,SUR-165AC6,,SUR165AC6.jpg,,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/smaslin/SUR165AC6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1049396.jpg
941113,Brooch,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Brooch of Central European, Bronze Age, type, c.1100-800 BC. It is made from a single length of 2.7mm diameter, copper alloy wire, one end of which is a tightly wound to form a six turn spiral. From this the wire is bent back on itself to form a hook-like catch plate. The wire is twisted back and forth to form five, figure of 8 loops on the end of which is an integral pin. The wire is cracked at this point. The brooch is in excellent condition with a mid-brown patination which contains some grains of sand. Length 99.3mm, Width 41.7mm, Height 26.2mm, Mass 30.31g.



This brooch is of Central European type and can be closely paralleled by two examples found in a hoard of gold jewellery on the bank of the Danube between Duna-Földvár and Paks in Hungary. This was dated to the 11th to 9th century BC (Hugh Tait, 7000 years of Jewellery, The British Museum, 2006, 51, plate 108). A further parallel is provided by an example in Merseyside Museums which is provenance as 'Northern Hungary' (Susan Nicholson, Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in the Merseyside County Museums, Merseyside County Council, Liverpool,, 1980, 70, No. 141.

The object consists of two pointed drop-shaped elements (one point is lost due to abrasion), D-shaped in cross-section and joined at their widest point, by a longitudinally recessed oval neck. There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both domed sides of the object, the tapering lower parts are plain. The two moustache tips or prongs flare slightly outwards and the retained point terminates in a narrow point. The central neck section of the object is plain and undecorated but the underside (between the two prongs) has a sub-circular perforation, believed to facilitate the attachment of the object.





The metal has a dark green smooth patina with some areas of light green corrosion.





Height: 19.95mm, Width: 43.91mm, Thickness: 12.66mm, Weight: 21.2g","These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117).

The socket is circular and tapers from the open mouth into the shaft between the blade's wings. There are two lozenge-shaped drilled 'loops' located between the socket mouth and the blade.

Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis'  (1909) Class IV which they date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Davis (2012) has recently provided a more thorough typology of Bronze Age spearheads in Britain in which he dates side looped forms to The Acton Park Phase (1550-1400 cal BC) (Davis 2012: 108) with the suggestion that in some areas this use may be extended slightly into the Taunton Phase (Davis 2012: 108) (1400-1250 cal BC) their exact position in these periods being dependent on the form of the blade. This spear blade most closely fits his Class 6b (Davis 2012: 82) including Nos.309, 311 and 313..

Description



1. [ENF 127270 (1167).1] Complete copper alloy quoit-headed pin. The shank is roughly circular sectioned and has a marked bend near the tip.  The shank with the lower part of the head is broken away from the rest of the head with what appears to be a recent break. The edges of the oval head are raised into slight flanges.  The surface is covered with corrosion products but is probably undecorated. 



Weight: 86g, Max length: 317mm; Max width of oval head loop: 165mm, Max width of oval head/loop: 124mm; Max width of head/loop: 6mm



2. [ENF 127270 (1167).5] Complete copper alloy quoit-headed pin. The shank is roughly circular sectioned and has a marked bend near the tip.  The break on this pin appears to be older, but is probably relatively recent. The edges of the oval head are raised into distinct flanges. The surface is covered with corrosion products but is probably undecorated.



Weight: 117g, Max length: 376mm; Max width of oval head loop: 167mm; Max height of oval head: 153mm; Max width of head/loop: 10mm



3. [ENF 127270 (1176).2] Complete copper alloy spiral twisted torc (or 'neckring') with plain hooked terminals.  The surface is covered with corrosion products so it is not clear whether the torc is bar twisted or cast.  The breaks are recent.



Weight: 91g, Max diameter: (somewhat oval) c.175mm by 160mm; Max width: 7mm



4. [ENF 127270 (1176).3] Complete copper alloy spiral twisted torc (or 'neckring') with plain hooked terminals. The surface is covered with corrosion products so it is not clear whether the torc is bar twisted or cast.  The breaks appear ancient.



Weight: 94g, Max diameter: (approximately circular), c.182mm by 186mm; Max width: 7mm



5. [ENF 127270 (1176).4] Incomplete copper alloy spiral twisted armring/bracelet. The surface is covered with corrosion products so it is not clear whether the bracelet is bar twisted or cast.  Both terminals are missing and the breaks are ancient.



Weight: 42g, Max diameter: (approximately circular but slightly misshapen) c.77mm 



6. [ENF 127270 (1167).6] Incomplete copper alloy plain penannular bracelet. The surface is relatively un-corroded.  Sub-circular in profile with slightly flattened internal face. Both terminals missing although are squared on the surviving parts.  The breaks are ancient.



Weight: 46g, Max diameter: (approximately circular) c.75mm 



Note on condition: The objects have been superficially cleaned but are in need of x-ray (which may reveal further detail) and conservation.



Discussion



The 'Hopton-on-Sea' hoard can be dated typologically to the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC). Their dating can be further narrowed down to type and metalwork phase. The quoit-headed pins, twisted torcs and bracelet are characteristic of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' which has been dated to the Taunton and Penard metalwork phases (c.1400-1150 BC) (Roberts 2007, 139-41). 





There are several close parallels for 'ornament hoards' of this phase with a mixture of torcs, quoit-headed pins and bracelets/arm rings, for example the Barton Bendish hoard, Norfolk (Hawkes 1955, GB 7:2 (1-2); Rowlands 1976, 249, no. 93); the Monkswood hoard, Somerset (Smith 1959a, GB 42:2; Rowlands 1976, 257, no. 115) and the Taunton Union Workhouse hoard, Somerset (Smith 1959a, GB 43:2; Rowlands 1976, 258-9, no. 120).



Twisted neck-rings and bracelets have mostly been found in Southern England, especially in Wessex and East Anglia (Rowlands 1976, map 22; Roberts 2007, appendix). Four bronze spiral-twisted torcs from three sites are known from Norfolk (Ibid.), while only three spiral-twisted bracelet/armrings are known (Ibid.), all from the Barton Bendish hoard (Hawkes 1955, GB 7:2 (2)). Plain penannular bracelets are a relatively common feature of Middle Bronze Age hoards in Southern England and their Continental European parallels have been discussed by O'Connor (1980, 86-7, 467-8).



Quoit-headed pins are relatively rare: less than 60 are known (Pendleton, personal dataset; cf. Rowlands 1976, 86-7, map 21). Prior to the Hopton-on-Sea find, only nine quoit-headed pins were known from eight sites in Norfolk (Roberts 2007, Appendix; Robbins 2008; Crawford 2009). The Hopton-on-Sea examples are some of the largest, being the 5th and 7th longest recorded (C. Pendleton, personal dataset; cf. Rowlands 1976, 86). The largest are those from the Boughton Fen hoard, Norfolk at 435 mm; from the Pentney Hoard, Norfolk at 400mm; one of the Taunton Union Workhouse pins is c.400mm; the Newhaven area hoard, Sussex example is c.555mm and an unprovenanced pin in the British Museum is c.348mm long.  The recently excavated fragment from Lambourne, West Berkshire may also approach this size.  The Hopton pins also have the 3rd and 4th largest heads, only the Boughton Fen and Newhaven area pin heads are larger (C. Pendleton, personal dataset).



The two Hopton-on-Sea pins both have their tips bent.  This is a common feature on the larger pins suggesting it was deliberate and probably functional.  The flat section heads with flanges are also commonly found on both larger and smaller pins.  There are a range of other significant traits on quoit-headed pins.  Their form and size varies considerably yet there does not appear to be any identifiable regional traits, with examples of all types being found in the different regions of southern England (they occur mainly in East Anglia, the south coast and south-west).





It is notable that some of the objects in the hoard display ancient breaks, others are utilised or incomplete (though still usable) indicating this group is likely to be of a functional and personal nature, a common feature on most Middle Bronze Age hoards in the region. The torcs and quoit-headed pins appeared to have been deposited in the ditch fill as pairs of objects and there may therefore be some intentional grouping in the way the hoard was deposited.



Ornament hoards are a feature of the period in Continental Europe, particularly in NW France. Indeed, twisted torcs have close parallels in Continental Europe, especially the Nordic area (Smith 1959b, 149; O'Connor 1980, 79-80). However, quoit-headed pins are unique to southern England, the most northerly known so far coming from Ranby, Lincolnshire (Rowlands 1976, 86, map 21; cf. Roberts 2007, 143, fig. 4). The find therefore represents a collection of ornaments with both local (Southern English) and European parallels.

942948,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy ribbed socketed axe head dating to the later Bronze Age (c. 950-750 BC). The surviving axe consists of part of the broken body and blade, with missing loop and collar. The body of the axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge. The cast longitudinal moulding consisting of four parallel ribs extends partially along both the front and rear faces, terminating at what would approximately have been the mid-point of each face. The moulding is incomplete where the axe is broken, and very worn on one side. The sides of the axe are lentoidal in plan and the trimmed central longitudinal casting seams are clearly visible. The body of the axe narrows towards the expanded blade. The blade edge is rounded and damaged in several areas through abrasion and corrosion and is missing one tip. The inside of the axe is hollow and sub-rectangular in cross-section and contains small traces of depositional residual on the interior surfaces. As well as being unevenly broken at one end, the axe also has several areas of lamination and scratches on its outside surfaces, all of which are patinated, like all of the exterior surfaces, in a mid-green colour. The interior surfaces of the axe have a similar coloured patina with additional patches of brown.



The axe measures 73.5mm in length, 39.6mm in width and 3.8mm thick at the blade, 29.2mm in width and 28.8mm thick at the broken socketed end, 3.9mm in maximum wall thickness, and weighs 147.30 grams.

The blade has a trapezoidal hilt with the surviving shoulder rounded and containing a single rivet hole. The other shoulder is missing, with an old patinated break across its rivet hole. The top edge is slightly concave between the shoulders, but this is probably owing to damage. The blade narrows from the shoulders to the break, the edges being slightly concave. The blade is elliptical in cross-section, with a slightly thicker centre, but no central rib or any decoration on the blade. The tip of the blade is missing, with an old break running across it at a slight diagonal. It is not possible to estimate the original length of the rapier or dirk. The blade has a mottled green and brown patina on both sides. It is 93.2mm long, 41.4mm wide and 2.4mm thick. It weighs 35.68g.



Taplow Type dirks (less than 30cm long) and rapiers often have four rivet holes (unlike this example), and rounded shoulders as this one does.

The socket end is square in shape, measuring 30.4mm by 30.5mm. All four internal surfaces are intact and in good condition. On the upper and lower surface there is a raised casting flash, following a seam along the length of the object. On all four sides a raised pattern of three lines wraps around the object, taking up the space between the end and the small, shallow handle. The internal space is a condensed circle measuring 7.1mm in diameter, while the handle surface itself is tapered, from a narrow triangle at the proximal end to a wide flare at the distal end. The object itself narrows from 30.5mm to 21.8mm in width, before flaring sharply to a small, neat blade that measures 27.8mm across and is 3.1mm thick at the cutting edge. The blade is a convex curve.



The surface is covered with a mid-green patina with large areas of a darker corrosion. There is one patch where this darker corrosion has caused deeper damage to the metal, approximately 3/4 of the way down the shaft, where there is also a sharper linear nick in the surface.

Description: 



A decorated sheet of gold of probable Bronze Age date, c.1000 - 800 BC.



The object is formed of a thin sub-rectangular sheet of gold, folded over at one end. It is not possible to determine if the object is complete or cut down though the latter is likely. The front surface of the sheet is decorated by a series of sub-parallel indented grooves running along its length.



Dimensions:



Length: 10.4mm; Width: 9.6mm; Thickness: 0.3mm; Weight: 0.4g.



Discussion:



Similar objects have been recorded as 2019 T316 (LEIC-47D0C2), 2018 T650 (HAMP-F792A5), 2010 T664 (LVPL-83FE92) and 2013 T471 (WMID-3CBCF0). The latter record states that similar multi-grooved strips of Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48).



2017 T882 (SOM-62CE08) states that several similar pieces have also been found bent into cylindrical beads and it is unclear if this was their original purpose or if this was a common reuse for parts of larger ribbon ornaments.

944832,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,1150,410,"An unfinished cast copper alloy miniature socketed axehead, dating to c.1150 BC-410 AD. The axe has the remains of the irregular globule of casting sprue at the cutting edge. Broadly sub-triangular with tapering parallel sides. The socket opening is oval. One face of the axe demonstrates a casting flaw which slightly distorts the profile of the object, though there are no casting seams visible anywhere on the object. A prominent sub-circular groove is visible on one edge of the axe, this is probably a failed attempt at creating a loop which may have served to suspend the piece, this is probably the reason why the object was not completed.

The fragment comprises the extreme tip and is relatively well preserved. The piece is sub-triangular in plan with a distinctive bi-convex profile. The break is old and patinated but the artefact is relatively unabraded. The cutting edges are slightly rolled and the central rib extends to the tip making a strong puncturing point. The surface patina is a brown colour with a well formed surface longitudinal patinated scratches are present on either edge suggesting that the spear had been used and sharpened. A direct parallel or narrower date cannot be suggested due to the fragmentary nature of the artefact.

946113,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy  spearhead, of Middle to Late Bronze Age date (1200-800 BC).



The blade is narrow and triangular with a pronounced mid rib on both sides extending to the tip of the spear which tapers in to a point. In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. There are multiple abrasions and missing portions of the edges. The fragment terminated in an old abraded transverse break. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing and the retained portions has a shallow concave aspect expose by the break.



The metal is a mid-green in colour with a pitted and corroded patina.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).

946529,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"A cast copper alloy unlooped palstave axehead of Middle Bronze Age date (circa 1500 to circa 1300 BC). The axehead is broken at the butt end with a ragged, but ancient, break. It has two longitudinal flanges which extend from the butt end beyond the curving stop ridge. Viewed from the side, these ridges are lozenge shaped. The attributes on the palstave are very worn. It is likely that there was a shield-shaped moulding below the stop ridge and a rib down the centre of the blade on both faces. The blade is narrow and without the usual prominent splayed tips of other early palstaves. The axehead is heavily worn and corroded, with a pitted grey-green patina. There are areas of a glossy olive green patina on either side of the stop ridge, on both faces of the axe. This palstave axehead belongs to the Taunton Phase of Bronze Age metalwork, dating circa 1400-1250 BC. It is similar to no. 809 in Schmidt and Burgess 1981, described as a low flanged palstave Type Wantage Variant Blackrock.



The object measures 119.2mm in length and is 38.3mm at the widest point of the blade. It is 21.1mm wide at the butt end. It is 18.7mm thick across the stop ridge and only 5.7mm thick at the thinnest part of the blade.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-03-20T00:00:00Z,2019-03-20T00:00:00Z,,,,,,18.7,119.2,1,Natasha Harlow,Natasha Harlow,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Stratford-on-Avon,Tanworth-in-Arden,SP1073,Generated from computer mapping software,52.35497432,-1.85459865,DENO-B68BB2,,DENOB68BB2.jpg,Bronze Age palstave axe,Derby Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENOB68BB2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1056716.jpg
947201,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-1000,"Description: Rectangular piece of gold sheet with repoussé and punched decoration, of early to middle Bronze Age date. The decoration consists of three longitudinal panels, each one made from a pair of relief lines or creases with  corresponding grooves on the reverse, so either pushed out from the reverse (the repoussé technique) or hammered over a  shaped former or patrix.  Each of the panels is filled with two longitudinal rows of punched dots, some set in pairs and others offset to give a zig-zag effect. The punch used was circular and round-ended.



Each short edge is broken, but each straight long edge has about 2mm in width neatly folded over to the reverse; the fold runs along the outermost of the relief lines. The entire object is now crumpled.



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 40mm. The width varies due to the crumpled condition, from a minimum of 13mm in the centre to a maximum of 17mm at one end. The sheet is perhaps 0.25mm thick and the folded areas are a maximum of 1.5mm thick. It weighs 3.0g.



Discussion and Date: Rectangular gold strips with dot or pointillé decoration have been recorded on the PAS database at BUC-4313C7, PAS-35C8A8 and WAW-FF1E9A, and longitudinal creases have been recorded at WILT-34D958. This example has relatively complex decoration, but otherwise fits well into a group of ribbon or strip ornaments of early to middle Bronze Age date, c. 2350 to 1000 BC.","As the object is made of more than 10% precious metal and is over 300 years old, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.

The hilt of the sword is formed from a straight bar (45mm long), the forward side of which tapers into the narrow grip. The grip is 75mm long and has slightly convex sides, bring at the thickest two thirds along its length. There is a line of three rivet holes in the centre of the grip. The grip leads onto the hilt of the sword that expands outwards with straight angled edges and two rivet holes on each side. Form the hilt the sides curve down to the leaf shaped blade which is 29mm wide near its base and gently expands to 39mm wide at the final quarter before rapidly narrowing to the pointed tip. In cross-section the blade has a low oval shape with pointed tips that have bevelled edges.





This item has been broken into seven separate parts, at each of the breaks the sword has been bent by between 30-40 degrees in order to achieve the break. This is not post-depositional damage but a premeditated act prior to loss/burial.

947589,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-100,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy rounded moustache-shaped object of late Bronze Age or Iron Age date.



Description: The object has been cast in one and survives as half of its original crescentric shape. The remaining half tapers to a damaged point from a bulbous body down to a point with cast alternating ridges and grooves running up to the point. The alternating pattern is not present on the inside edge of the object and consists of 22 lines in total. The object appears to have snapped just pst the grooved body as seen on KENT-77A0BF. The point has also been blunted and splayed. The breaks seems to be heavily worn 



Measurements: 41.7mm wide, 35.27mm high. 14.56mm thick. 20.36g



Discussion: A good number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database. Examples with a shape very similar to this example include PAS reference numbers KENT-77A0BF, NARC-925E14,  HAMP-6F4C45 and BERK-719DA8. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117).



They are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although the lozenge shaped recess at the bottom of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. This was possibly something such as a dagger handle, although the absence of evidence makes this conjectural. Another suggestion has been a Scabbard Chape, in which case the object would be the other way up. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,20.36,35.27,,14.56,41.7,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Maidstone,Lenham,TQ9051,Centred on field,51.22656114,0.7197557,KENT-4C615E,,KENT4C615E.jpg,fragment of Moustache shaped object,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT4C615E.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1052257.jpg

Description: From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117).

The palstave has worn high side flanges with long extensions, their highest point being above the stop ridge, with the base circles of the side-loop on either side of the stop ridge, and a broad blade that is triangular in plan. The squared-off protruding stop ridge produces a rectangular aperture in plan and the worn down side flanges are lozenge-shaped in profile.The stop is 11 mm wide and 9 mm deep on both sides and the thickness of the worn side flanges together, front and back, is 23 mm. Below the stop ridge the narrow blade is parallel to the exterior in plan, at 20 mm wide, and inset from the stop ridge in profile and 10 mm thick, and starts to expand into the triangular blade after 10 mm towards the cutting edge which is 55 mm wide and 2 mm thick. The blade has a central mid rib which is 4 mm wide and 68 mm long, and two raised edges, 4 mm thick, following the slightly curved edge of the blade to a length of 80 mm. The two bases of the side loop project outwards 1 mm from the surface of one side of the palstave and are 5 mm in diameter and 8 mm apart. The casting seam below the loop as been chiselled away, but there is still a raised seam above it, and another seam on the opposite side of the hafting end of the palstave. The entire surface of the palstave is corroded and pitted and the cutting edge of the blade is damaged and subsequently corroded so it is difficult to determine how much the edge was used and resharpened.

951376,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"Fragment of a copper-alloy Bronze Age socketed spearhead. The handle socket is entirely missing from an old brittle-break at the point where it would have originally joined the blade. The pronounced midrib continues for the full length of the blade with an internally round socket extending just over halfway towards the tip. Externally the midrib contours smoothly to form the wings of the spearhead blade, the profile of which has a sub-lozengiform shape, reaching a maximum width at the approximate halfway point. The profile of the blade wings from the socket to the widest point has a slight curve suggesting more of a leaf-shape profile, but the forward profile to the tip is much more of a linear taper with one flange stepping-in slightly suggesting material loss at this point, either through post deposition damage or perhaps more likely in-use modification such as sharpening. There is no extant evidence of edge bevelling around any of the blade periphery. Unfortunately due to the missing socket it is not possible to determine the means of attachment to the shaft, either with Middle Bronze Age loops, or pegs associated with the later Bronze Age.

Two additional amorphous copper-alloy fragments were also found in the immediate vicinity. Total weight 125g.



1. Small butt-end fragment of a flanged palstave. Oblique brittle fracture, pitted dark brown patination with green around eroded edges. Extant length 35mm, width 18mm, weight 35g.



2. Triangular tip fragment of a spearhead. Sharp midrib giving a star-like cross section. Transverse brittle fracture. Dark brown patination. Length 41mm, width 17.7mm, thickness 7.6mm, weight 9g.



3. Crescent-shaped cutting edge fragment probably from a palstave. Blade width almost complete, with one side truncated just short of the full width. Curved brittle and broadly transverse fracture across the crescentic edge (maximum width in centre of fragment 15mm) Dark brown pitted patination very similar to 1, and could be opposite ends of the same object. Length 59mm, thickness 6.5mm, weight 18g.



4. Blade fragment of a socketed chisel, flaring from 15mm to 27mm over its 41mm extant length. Broken towards the butt end with the thin-walled socket (0.9mm) pushed in from one side causing a crease down towards the blade end. The socket neck at the point of fracture was originally oval, extending to a maximum depth of 33mm into the 41mm extant length of the chisel. Weight 14.72g. 



5. Amorphous sub-ovoid globule with matching patination and colouration to other objects. Maximum length 18mm, maximum thickness 9.2mm, weight 10g.



6. Unidentified fragment with exposed uncorroded scraped bare metal on both faces, probably as a result of recent cultivation damage. The object has some form, with what appear to be original edges, but the parent object cannot be determined. Length 58mm, maximum width 18mm, weight 38g.



Discussion and Date: Objects 1 to 3 are possibly Middle Bronze Age in date, but as fragments the diagnostic features that position them more precisely in the period are missing. Socketed chisels (object 4) are known in the late Middle Bronze Age and are transitional into the late Bronze Age. Items 5 and 6 cannot be identified, but although these are largely amorphous and cannot be identified in isolation as part of the hoard, the proximity within the group and the nature of the material strongly suggests they are an integral part of the deposition made in the late Middle Bronze Age. It is possible, however, that they were gathered together at a later date.","The finds are all of Bronze Age date and as they represent a single find of two or more copper-alloy finds of prehistoric date, they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2019-02-22T00:00:00Z,2019-04-03T23:00:00Z,2019T434,,125,,,,,6,Garry Crace,Garry Crace,Eastern,Norfolk,South Norfolk,Bressingham,TM0782,,52.39685663,1.04109525,NMS-833D15,,63363_833D15_MBA_Palstave1.jpg,Butt End fragment of a middle BA palstave,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/63363_833D15_MBA_Palstave1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1055627.jpg

Description: The axehead has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle, with two concave faces flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentic cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It is proceed by a double raised collar. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have been worked down either through hammering or filing/polishing, but remain fairly prominant particularly towards the collar end. The blade edge has some wear but remains in good conditions. The side loop remains on one side. The axehead has a dark greenish well formed patina with some slightly lighter mottling in places, but is fairly restricted although may be areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.

Discussion: This group of palstaves represents an important addition to the Middle Bronze Age hoards from coastal areas in Britain and the near Continent (see Needham et al. 2013, Ch. 4). Three or four of the palstaves are of Breton type and two or three are of Norman type, with only one recognisable as a British type. The closest parallel for this find is the Marnhull hoard, Dorset, where 90 palstaves were recovered (25 of Breton type and the majority of the remainder of Norman type) (Lawson & Farwell 1991; cf. O'Connor 2009, 274-5). O'Connor suggests that these palstaves originated in Lower Normandy (Ibid., 274). Breton and Norman type palstaves were also found together at Hayling Beach, Hampshire in gravel (and therefore possibly redeposited from elsewhere; see Ibid. for details and references) and from Easton, Hampshire (Ibid.). It is likely that the Continental palstave types from the 'Portsmouth area' hoard were also imports and therefore form an important additional find.



The uncertain origins of this hoard make it difficult to establish how the objects were deposited. However, the unusually degraded condition and quality of the patina of the palstaves described above (Nos. 1-12), combined with their unusual typology (primarily imports of Breton and Normandy types from France) make it highly probable that they were deposited together as a single deposit.



Conclusion: As a find of two or more objects of copper alloy, this find qualifies a Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

953256,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"Two complete gold-plated cast penannular rings dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age (c.1150-750 BC), and a probable Bronze Age (c. 1000 BC-750 BC) awl. 



The penannular rings are in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop that tapers slightly towards the terminals. One of the rings is plain. The other is heavily corroded on the surfaces but appears to have ribbed decoration.



The uncorroded ring is 16.9mm in diameter, with a thickness of 5.7mm and a weight of 8.14 grans. The corroded ring is 19mm in diameter, 7mm thick and weighs 11.41 grams.



The probable Bronze Age awl is circular in section and tapers to a blunt point at one end and a rounder point at the other. The surface has a dark green patina with some small areas of fine pitting. 



The awl measures 85.2mm in length, a maximum of 4.2mm in diameter and weighs 6.88 grams.



Awls are difficult to date but most are probably the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117), they were presumably used for perforating leather.



As a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002). They note that although most awls are associated with leather working, some would have been used in woodworking, bone working and other crafts.","Conclusion:  As the penannular rings are Bronze Age in date and made of gold, they qualify as treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996. Being found close to them and of similar date, it is possible that the awl is associated with them and qualifies as treasure as part of this case.

953258,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A nearly complete copper alloy dirk, dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500-1300 BC) and 153.8mm in length The butt is trapezoidal with two rivet holes partially preserved. The original mushroom rivets are lost. The dirk is 43.5mm wide across the butt and narrows to 14.5mm at the blade tip, which has been lost. The blade has bevelled edges and a flattened lozengiform / lentoid cross section with a distinctive central rib which extends all the way from butt to the tip. This thickened rib adds strength to the blade and is a diagnostic feature of this type of short sword or dirk which is thought to be used for thrusting and piercing rather than cutting and slashing. The blade is slightly bent midway along although it is unclear as to whether this demonstrates an intentional pre-depositional act. The edges of the blade and the surface demonstrate post depositional damage and loss from corrosion.","This dirk is perhaps best attributed to a Taplow or Keelogue Type of the Acton Park industry.

953349,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Late Bronze Age (c1150 to c800 BC) gold penannular ring (or 'lock ring') formed from gold sheets; the weight of the object suggests that these are probably wrapped around a copper-alloy core. The ring is bi-conical in form, with flat triangular terminals. There is a prominent ridge running around the outer edge. Both faces are decorated by transverse, parallel striations. There is some damage to the inner edge of one of the faces, where the two sheets have come apart slightly.

The item has a socketed shaft, with two aligned perforations near the top of the shaft on either side. The socketed shaft tapers to a band and then flares into a sub triangular head that gradually thins to a cutting edge. The object is in good condition and is largely brown with a Verdigris patina. A small piece of wood was found inside the socket; it is very small and fits into the base of the shaft. It is roughly triangular in shape with a rounded tip and mainly green in colour. A tiny copper alloy pin was also discovered in the perforation hole.

954279,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"An incomplete copper alloy side-looped spear of Middle Bronze Age dating (c. 1550 BC to c. 1250 BC). It fits into the Acton Park or Taunton phases. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).



The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces, triangular in cross-section, giving a lozenge shaped cross-section at the point. There is some damage to the edges of the blade and no edge bevels are discernable. The socket is oval in cross-section and is hollow. The socket is 50.8 mm deep. It has cast side loops roughly half way along the socket. The loops are a flat oval in cross-section, and one is blocked with a casting flange that has not been trimmed. The casting seams along the sides of the socket have been trimmed.



It measures 120.2 mm in length. a maximum blade width of 23.5 mm, a minimum blade width of 8.0 mm. The edges of the blades are 1.7 mm thick. At the base of the wings, the socket has an external diameter of 12.8 mm and at the base of the socket, it measures 18.2 mm. The socket is 2.3 mm thick. The side loops measure 14.4 mm long and 5.4 mm wide. They are 3.3 mm above the surface of the socket. It weighs 63.13 g.



The spear has a smooth dark brown patina.

954440,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"An incomplete copper alloy flanged axehead, of middle Bronze Age dating (c. 1600 BC to c. 1400 BC).



The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow and thin butt end which extends to a curved cutting edge with splayed blade. Raised flanges are present along the edges of both sides of the axehead each showing signs of heavy wear. No casting flashes are visible. No sign of a proto stop.



It measures 103.0 mm long, 28.2 mm wide at the blade, 16.5 mm wide at the butt end. 7.2 mm thick in the centre, 11.0 mm thick including the flanges. It weighs 91.78 g. The flanges are 52.7 mm long, extending from the butt end to midway along the body. They extend a maximum of 2.4 mm above the body.



The axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. The surface is heavily pitted, either as a result of poor casting or due to soil conditions whilst buried.



Similar flanged axeheads have been recorded on the PAS database, including: YORYM-D5C7D6. The lack of a proto stop ridge is suggestive that this flanged axehead may fall within the Acton Park I phase, possibly dating to between c. 1600 BC to c. 1400 BC. However due to the surface condition, it is hard to confirm.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,91.78,,,11,103,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Mavesyn Ridware,SK0618,From finder,52.75957418,-1.91253021,WMID-3D23A2,,WMID3D23A2.jpg,Middle Bronze Age: Incomplete Flanged Axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID3D23A2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1057769.jpg

The surface has some wear and corrosion but appears to be undecorated. Weight 22.09g. Extant length 208mm. Width of head loop: 77mm. c.1400-1250 BC.



Quoit-headed pins are characteristic of the Middle Bronze Age 'ornament horizon' which has been dated to the Taunton and Penard metalwork phases (Roberts 2007, 139-41). Quoit-headed pins are relatively rare, with c. 80 known examples. The bent tip is a common feature on the larger pins suggesting it was deliberate and probably functional.

954588,Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A complete, cast, copper alloy annular ring dating to the late Bronze Age (c.1000-800BC)



The ring has a solid round cross section, with a thicker section (8.25mm) bearing three slightly swollen areas facing outward, possibly as decoration. The object is otherwise undecorated.



The metal has a dark brown patina. The surface is moderately pitted. particularly in the thicker area, possibly damaged in use.



23.85mm diameter (external), 10.23 mm internal diameter. Thickness 8.25 mm at thickest part to 6mm at narrowest. 20.2g



Similar rings have been discovered as part of late Bronze Age hoards (see for example: (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, plate 152; YORYM-15AA2D/2014-T442, the latter noting the possibility ""that the ring was a fitting on the haft of a socketed axe"" perhaps explaining why these rings are often found as part of socketed axe assemblages). The PAS database record for for WILT-1A5240 includes the suggestion that rings of this form may have been part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended, or part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron (citing: Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g). This record also notes that the ring may be a form of harness ring (see Note below). Other examples recorded on the PAS database include: LIN-4EE61E; HAMP-6F9658; NARC-5B60BD; WILT-30BB4B; LANCUM-D8A073 etc.



(Note: The possibility that this ring may have been an early Lewis (2015, 77:) form of Type (i) Plain round Terret ring (excavated examples from secure contexts dating from the 5th century BC to the mid-2nd century BC) was considered. However, Lewis states that this Type is usually made of iron, or iron with a copper-alloy sheath (ibid, 87) thus, and given the relatively small size, an earlier form of Bronze age ring was the preferred interpretation.)

The palstave is slender in form, tapering from the broad and low stop to the flared cutting edge. The butt is relatively long and slim, and would once have had ridges on either side, although these have been damaged post depositionally and are now reduced to slight raised areas on either side of the butt. Similarly, on one side the base of a loop is just visible, but the loop is now destroyed. On both faces, at the point where where the butt meets the stop there is a small horizontal groove, but it is not clear whether this is part of the design or the result of damage. The object is covered in a dark green patina, although some areas of the original brownish colour survive with pocks and scores in the surface indicative of damage.



It is similar to IOW-8A6D18, but NMS-1719F0 is a better parallel which is in far superior condition and has the loop surviving.

Description: From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117).

The blade edge is abraded, slightly blunt where complete and has notches. Both faces of the blade are decorated with a single rib. The sides of the blade are triangular with a casting seam which has been smoothed, but still forms a slight ridge. There is no loop on the palstave.



The sides of the septum have a more prominent cast seam ridge, and the sides taper towards the butt of the palstave. There is a deep stop on both faces of the septum with a flange running down the sides on each face. The flanges on the side view taper in depth towards the butt. One face at the butt has a deeper possible air hole. The butt is abraded.



The palstave has an incomplete well-developed mottled dark grey patina which is pitted. Where there is a more recent scrape the metal is a shiny grey colour.



The palstave measures 153.44mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 57.46mm wide from blade tip to blade tip, and 27.87mm thick across the stops. It weighs 362g.



The palstave is similar to Figure 21, No. 154 in Savoury (1980). The palstave is an early/primary Group II example which dates to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to c. 1500-1300 BC.

The surface is corroded, with a double-ribbed collar running circumferentially just below the opening, and possible inscised circular decoration on the more degraded face of the object.



A similar, more complete, example can be seen is Leahy and Lewis (2018: 332) from Rockbourne in Hampshire. Other comparable chapes recorded on the PAS database include: HAMP-095061; NARC-5DEF37; and DOR-BD9AED. Webley (2005) states that this type of chape is associated with the 'carp's tongue complex' of south-east England and dates to the Ewart Park metalworking phase.



The overall dimensions are as follows: 22.58mm in length, 31.86mm in width, 9.53mm in thickness and 12.43g in weight.

956747,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-1000,"A complete and hardly worn cast copper alloy late Middle Bronze Age/early Late Bronze Age palstave axehead of unlooped type. There is not much difference in width between septum and blade; the particular narrowness of the blade suggests an ancillary use as a chisel. The low flanges are slightly abraded with a small dent in one side. Just beyond the stop ridge on either side is plano-convex indentation. The blade end of the palstave widens from the stop ridge towards the cutting edge while reducing in thickness. The cutting edge is crescentic with slightly expanded and curved tips; the blade edge itself is bevelled on each side and narrow to a thin, sharp cutting edge. The casting seams along the edge of the palstave have been filed; pitting along the seam appears to have been filled with a molten bronze. Hammer-marks are visible along both sides.

The palstave dates to the late Middle Bronze Age or early Late Bronze Age, most likely within the late Taunton or possibly Penard metalwork assemblages, that is c. 1250-1000 BC, corresponding with Needham Period 5-6, Burgess metalworking phase IX - X. It can be compared with narrow bladed palstaves from the Sidlesham hoard, now in Chichester Museum (Rowlands 1976, Vol. 2, p. 269/pl. 8; ref. 148, especially 148.3); Rowlands classifies them as Class 1 narrow bladed palstaves. In discussing the form (ibid., Vol. 1, pp. 36-38), Rowlands notes they are common in early Late Bronze Age hoards in Southern Britain. At the time, the origin of these palstaves was thought to be Northern France.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,196,,,19.4,160,1,Anni Byard,Anni Byard,South East,Oxfordshire,Cherwell,Wendlebury,SP5619,From a paper map,51.86677597,-1.18810963,OXON-67519D,,,,,,,

The butt end is narrow (perhaps through wear), measuring 13.6mm wide and 6.1mm thick, expanding to the stop ridge (25.4mm wide and 23.5mm thick) which appears to overhang slightly on each face. The line of the butt end meets in a gentle curve at this point.

Below the blade flares from the stop ridge to the cutting edge, 32.1mm wide, perhaps curving outwards slightly just above.

The object has a thick light green crust largely lost in places to reveal a dark grey colour beneath.

He kept it in a sealed, wet environment which lead a month later to severe deterioration of the surface crust. Claire Woodhead, Conservator, Hampshire Cultural Trust, comments '[The] surface crust is unusual; brittle and porous. It is unclear how much metal remains in core. There is a possibility that copper sulphides have reacted with the water to form sulphates (i.e. sulphuric acid) which may have contributed to decay' (June 2019).

959547,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500 BC to c. 1150 BC) cast copper alloy side looped socketed spearhead. The spearhead socket is broadly an elongated sub-triangular in plan and profile with a leaf-shaped blade. The socket is almost complete and is circular at the base and tapers towards the blade. At the lower edge of the socket, on the exterior the surface is slightly off-set, therefore the external diameter of the socket becomes slightly smaller.



On the exterior edge of the socket, on either side, there is an integral loop which has oval perforations. A trace of a casting seam is visible on one side of the socket only.



The blade of the spear is leaf-shaped which has a pronounced midrib on both faces. One midrib has a slight recent scrape revealing fresh metal. The edges of the blade are slightly abraded thereby losing some of their cutting edge. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead.



The surface of the spearhead has an incomplete mid brown patina, which is lighter on the blade than the socket.



The spearhead measures 148.87mm in length, has a maximum width (across the blade) 25.78mm and maximum thickness of 17.76mm (across the socket). The depth of the socket is not know as still partially filled with soil. With the soil insert, the spearhead weighs 56.49g. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.



Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards which was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup.

959868,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-800,"A fragment an unidentified object of possible Bronze Age date, 2350 BC - 800 BC. It is a flat sub-rectangular piece of copper alloy, with tapering sides at the long edges and probable breaks for the short edges.It tapers in thickness, and there is a slight hint of a thickened mid-rib on one face. The long edges are chamfered, but have no surface patina surviving, making it impossible to know if they were original edges. The plate is too thick and the edges too abrupt to be part of a blade. The short edges are more uneven, and again, have no surface patina surviving, apart from one small speck in the middle of the shortest edge. They appear to be broken edges, and the patina which has mostly flaked off, could have developed since the breakage.



On both faces, there are patches of a more reflective grey material, perhaps a white metal rich alloy. The rest of the metal is dark grey where the patina survives, and light green and textured like fine sandpaper where is does not survive. It is 43.5mm long, 34.9mm wide and 6.6mm thick. It weighs 29.55g.



The possible Bronze Age date is given because it comes from the same field as SWYOR-107F44, a Taplow rapier. However, a prehistoric date is by no means certain.

960130,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"Middle to Late Bronze Age copper-alloy early palstave (1500-1300 BC): The blade of the palstave is sub-trapezoidal in plan with slightly concave sides, and very flared blade tips. The blade edge is abraded, and slightly blunt where complete. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical probably occurring due to use not corrosion. Both faces of the blade are decorated with a trident motif whose single ridge which tapers towards the cutting edge. The sides of the blade are triangular with a casting seam which has been smoothed, but still forms a slight ridge. On one side face, at the junction of the blade and septum there is an integral loop.



The sides of the septum have a more prominent cast seam ridge, and the sides taper towards the butt of the palstave. There is a deep stop on both faces of the septum with a flange running down the sides on each face. The flanges on the side view taper in depth towards the butt. The butt is a slightly broken edge and obliquely angled therefore, but the break is not too recent. The floor of the rib-stop is corroded, on both side, which does not match the patina covering the remaining surface of the palstave.



The palstave has an incomplete well-developed shiny blue-green coloured patina.



The palstave measures 142.15mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.90mm wide from blade tip to blade tip, and 30.26mm thick across the stops. It weighs 370g.



The palstave is similar to Figure 22, No. 166 in Savoury (1980). The palstave is an early/primary Group III example which dates to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to c. 1500-1300 BC.

960305,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1725,-1500,"Early Bronze Age flanged axehead



The cast axehead is complete (with a length of 87.2mm and a weight of 129.3g) but has lost much of the original surface. The butt is straight and thin (with a width of 17mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The sides are near-straight and parallel as far as the position of the bevel on the faces (where the axe has a width of 21.6mm, a thickness of 11.5mm and a maximum depth, including flanges of 14.9mm). The sides are decorated with diagonal ridges and are slightly convex and gently rounded across their depths. Below the stop the sides widen gradually before the recurved blade tips (with a blade width of 50.3mm and a blade depth of 21.2mm). The blade edge is crescentic but slightly straightened around its centre, possibly because of wear. The flanges begin just below the butt and have a regular curve before returning to the on the blade. The flanges are comparatively shallow (reaching a maximum height above the septum of 2.6mm). The septum gradually thickens linearly to the position of the bevel (66mm below the butt), which has a slight curve. Beneath the bevel, decorative ridges echo the bevel at the top of the blade. The decoration is only now partially preserved where there is surface preservation but the decoration is likely to have been contained between the flanges on the top of the blade (for 18mm below the stop). The faces of the blade gradually converge towards the edge and slightly convex across their lengths. The surface has patches with a dark-brown patina, with pale-brown areas of surface loss with some both green and blue corrosion.



The height of the flanges (above 1.5mm) and overall form of the axe means it can be confidently classed as a low-flanged axe, datable to the Arreton assemblage (c.1725-1500 cal. BC)/Period 4 of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997). The axe can be classed as Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 72-75) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming



Needham (1983, 198) lists 179 Class 5 axes from southern Britain, indicating the broad currency of this axe type. In Wales, approximately 26 examples are currently known from both hoards and isolated contexts, with recent discoveries rapidly changing the image of how these axes were circulated. Class 5 axes are present in hoards from Menai Bridge, Anglesey (Savory 1980, 115, No.259), Llanover, Monmouthshire (NMGW-3F3BBC) and Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0B9997).

960311,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1000,"Late Bronze Age dirk of Penard or Wallington metalworking Industry, dated to c. 1300 - 1000BC



The cast dirk is complete but now distorted across the mid blade (with a distorted length of 282mm, a straightened length of approximately 288mm and a weight of 94.4g). The butt is flat-topped, slightly angled (23.0mm wide and 1.8mm thick). There are two rivet notches beneath the butt and on the sides (of 8.5mm diameter, with their midpoints 9.6mm beneath the butt and giving a minimum butt width of 17.5mm). There is no clear hilt mark but there is the suggestion of a curving mark from the top of the blade on the sides and arcing down onto the midrib. Beneath the rivet notches, the sides of the butt are straight and near parallel (with a width of 10.2mm where the butt has a thickness of 4.6mm), before converging at the top of the blade (with a width of 17mm and where the dirk has a maximum thickness of 5.0mm). The sides of the blade are near-straight and gradually convergent before narrowing to the tip. The blade has a flattened mid-section rib (6.5mm wide). The blade facets are concave (4mm - 6mm wide) and the original blade edge is eroded and now lost. There is differential wear on one side, above the tip (for approximately 10cm above the tip). The dirk has a black patina, well preserved over much of the blade but lost at the position of the interior bend, perhaps suggesting the damage to the blade occurred post-deposition. Otherwise the blade has a grey-green to pale-brown corrosion.



The weapon is of Group IV and the hilt form and blade profile would suggest a Type Appleby dirk, as defined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p. 74)[1]. The rectangular form to the butt with upright sides would further suggest 'Variant Barnes' (ibid. p 76-7) of Type Appleby. However it is unclear whether the notches are cast into the hilt or the weapon was damaged and reworked from rivet holes. If the notches were original, then it may suggest a slightly later weapon of Type Stuntey, or similar, although these types often have more trapezoidal butt forms.

The cast dirk is near-complete, with some peripheral damage (with a length of 258mm and a weight of 77.5g). The top of the butt is flat and thin, with curved corners (with a butt width of 27.5mm and a thickness of 0.7mm). Beneath the butt the rivet-notches are a little irregular and of V-shaped profile (with a depth of 4.0mm - 4.4mm, a width of 7mm and are 18.8mm apart). Beneath the rivet-notches the sides widen to the shoulders, with some damage (with a width of 34.0mm, where the butt is 4.1mm thick). The edge at the top of the blade has a convex curve (for 13mm) before the near-straight edge, which gradually converges towards the tip (with a width of 18mm below the curved sides). The blade is thickest at the top of the blade (with a thickness of 5.0mm) and has a flat-topped midrib, curving from the shoulder and gradually narrowing until it defines a rib and produces a lozengic section to the blade (c. 35mm above the tip). There is no vertical hilt ridge but there is a hilt mark evident on one face, which has a slight convex curve from just below the shoulders. The blade has a gentle concave profile, each side of the midrib and sections of the blade edge are preserved. Much of the damage to the blade edge damage appears to be more recent although a few of the notches are patinated. Subtle striations are discernible, mostly running along the blade edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with some pitting and bright-green corrosion. The top of the butt has rounded hammering ridges from working and thinning and the butt has considerably less surface finishing than the blade.

Description: The object is cast in one piece comprising a narrowed body with two sweeping swollen drop shaped arms which tapers towards pointed terminals. The upper centre of the body has a recess.  The object is decorated with grooves, running top to botom of each arm creating a ribbed effect. It has a mottled light grey brown and light green patination. Part of the central body has some advanced green verdigris.



Measurements: 20.63mm long, 18.23mm wide, 10.58mm thick and 10.2g in weight.



Discussion: A number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered, with distinct variants identifiable. Examples with a shape very similar to this example have been recorded on the PAS at NARC-39B60B, NARC-2C32D7 and BERK-C3E5A3, with One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117).



They are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although recess in the body of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on or below something. This was possibly something such as a dagger handle, although the absence of evidence makes this conjectural. Another suggestion has been a Scabbard Chape, in which case the object would be the other way up.

From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper-alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117).



The metal is dark green in colour with a slightly pitted patina.

961011,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"Plain Pegged Spearhead with flame-shaped blade of Type 11 A - largely complete, two fragments (metal-detector find, number 9)

	




Dimensions: Surviving length approx. 195.0mm; max. blade width 46.6mm; max. blade length approx. 154.0mm; surviving socket length approx. 41.0mm; surviving external diameter of socket at break 25.9mm; depth of socket - unknown, as obscured by concretion; diameter of surviving peg hole approx. 5.7mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 190.2g. 



Dimensions of small socket fragment: max. surviving length 10.3mm; surviving width 7.5mm; thickness 1.5mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 0.4g. 



Combined weight (prior to conservation) 190.6g. 



This is a largely complete Plain Pegged spearhead of bronze, with a flame-shaped blade, which is now missing its lower socket and tip-end. Originally, the spearhead was probably around 220-230mm long. The point of maximum width on this blade is low and the blade edges follow a smooth curve from the blade/socket junction to the spear tip. The spearhead mid-rib is angled, providing a sub-lozengic cross-section. The mid-rib sides have very slightly concave profiles on the lower blade and near where the midrib merges into the top of the socket. The blade has a bevel which is a maximum of 3.5-4.0mm wide, surviving best on the lower blade sides. On one side of the socket, half of a peg-hole survives at the lower break, being approximately 5.7mm in diameter. A small socket wall fragment was detached and embedded within soil remaining inside the socket when reported and this was separated as the excess soil was removed in the conservation laboratory. The spearhead shows evidence of deliberate narrow blade damage in antiquity. On one face and mid-way down the mid-rib, there is an angled narrow blade impact. This has revealed the cavity down the hollow centre of the rib, also causing the whole spearhead blade to have been bent in side-section. Secondly, on the socket, there is evidence of one, possibly two, similar angled impacts with a narrow-bladed weapon or tool, causing a break and distortion in the socket wall. Finally, on one upper blade edge, there is a deep nick in the blade bevel, approximately 1.5mm deep and 1.5-2.0mm wide, which looks to have been made in antiquity. On both sides, there are areas of surface scraping, as if by glancing blows. One of these has revealed fresh bronze, suggesting this damage may be recent. The spearhead has a dark green patina on the blade, merging to brown on the socket. The upper blade surfaces are part covered with green and blue surface corrosion concretions.




Sword blade of Carp's Tongue Type - fragment (metal-detector find 3)



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 133.2mm; max. blade width 45.5mm; blade width near break 1 42.8mm; blade width near break 2 42.5mm; max. blade thickness 8.7mm; width mid-ridge 14.0-15.0mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 160.0g. 



This is a blade fragment of a bronze straight-sided sword. The sword has a rounded midrib, precisely defined by single grooves, 0.2-0.3mm wide, which follow the outline of the blade. The blade edges are defined by blade bevels, approximately 3.5mm wide. In places, there are striations along the blade bevel, indicating the blade edges were prepared for use. Original blade edges survive in short sections, however the edges and bevels are damaged through fragility and corrosion. Near one of the blade breaks, there is local distortion of the blade, the blade being distinctly bent in side view. This suggests the bending was caused, as pressure was being applied to snap the sword. The blade has a grey-green patina, with areas of blue corrosion surface concretions evident. The concretions are particularly marked and thick on one face (approximately 2.5mm thick), suggesting the blade may have been in direct contact with another bronze artefact in the hoard, as buried.




South Wales Type socketed axe - complete (metal-detector find 8)



Dimensions: Length 101.9mm; blade width 53.4mm; width body below loop 41.6mm; external mouth dimensions 49.1mm (side to side) by 39.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 34.7mm (side to side) by 26.6mm (front to back); dimensions runner stub (1) 7.2 by 3.7mm, height 0.3mm; dimensions runner scar (1) 6.4mm by 3.2mm; depth of socket approx. 68.0mm; width loop 6.1-6.9mm; weight (prior to conservation) 388.8g. 



A complete, bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a near rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides, splaying slightly towards the blade end. The loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding and is narrow. The runner stubs and scars are barely visible around the mouth, however slight ridges on the front and back sides, and a slight scar on the loop side, suggest that this axe was probably cast using a four-runner casting technology. The exterior outline of the mouth is sub-rectangular and the interior outline is slightly more curved and approaching sub-oval in shape. On one side, on the upper mouth moulding beneath the mouth, there is a slight indent, as if the bronze has been cast slightly above a defined edge in the mould part. Three longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, though now partly obscured by surface corrosion deposits. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering after casting. The blade bevel is largely obscured by corrosion deposits, however there are slight striations both parallel and at right-angles to the blade edge in one small area, suggesting that the axe may have been sharpened for use. On both sides of the axe, there are green and blue patches of corrosion products, while the original surfaces have a grey-green patina. On one lower blade face, there are two small areas of thick blue-green concretions with flattened top surfaces, which may once have attached to the flat face of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group.




South Wales Type socketed axe - complete (small find number 7)



Dimensions: Length 120.1mm; blade width 55.1mm; width body below loop (including flashes) 47.0mm; width body below loop (excluding flashes) approx. 42.0mm; external mouth dimensions (including flashes) 61.2mm (side to side) by 47.3mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 37.0mm (side to side) by 31.6mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 9.0 by 3.6mm; height 0.1mm; (2) 8.0 by 4.0mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 9.2 by 4.4mm; height 0.3mm; (4) 9.6 by 3.4mm; height 0.1mm; width loop 4.8-5.2mm; depth of socket approx. 79.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 458.5g. 



This is a complete and long, slender bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. This heavy axe has slightly concave and slightly divergent sides and there is no splaying or recurving near the blade edges. The loop is high and narrow, and descends from the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degree apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Three prominent and longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, extending nearly two-thirds of the way down the axe faces. Though near parallel to each other, they are not quite straight with very slight meanders evident. It is evident that this axe was never prepared for use and in just out of the mould state. The casting flashes down both sides are prominent and very sharp and the loop was never used. The blade edge was never hammered or sharpened for use and there is excess around the mouth top, which was never filed or hammered down. Large areas of the axe's surfaces are covered with blue corrosion products, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. On one upper face, there is a particularly prominent area of corrosion with flattened upper surfaces, which may once have attached to the flat faces of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. The original surfaces of this axe have a grey-green patina.




South Wales Type socketed axe - fragment (metal-detector find 6)



Dimensions: Surviving length 65.6mm; width body below loop 41.7mm; external mouth dimensions 50.2mm (side to side) by 42.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 35.3mm (side to side) by 29.5mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 13.4 by 4.8mm; height 1.3mm; (2) 11.7 by 6.1mm; height 1.5mm; (3) 12.3 by 3.0mm; height 0.2mm; (4) 10.7 by 3.5mm; height 0.1mm; width loop 5.1-6.6mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 135.9g. 



This is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The axe has straight but slightly divergent sides, but the lower body and blade end is missing. The high loop descends from the under-side of the mouth-moulding and is narrow. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular in plan. Three prominent, longitudinal and near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, while the face edges are slightly curved, rather than angular. The lower break edge, in plan, indicates there was a misalignment in the placing of the internal mould-piece relative to the outer mould pair during casting, with one face-wall being notably thicker than the other. On the non-loop side of the axe, near the break edge and in the area of particular wall thinning, there is a crack or split in the metal, which meanders upwards onto one of the faces. This suggests that the axe may have failed and broken during use. The casting seams are prominent but blunt, suggesting rapid hammering of the excess after casting. The axe has a grey-green patina and there are small localised encrustations of green and blue corrosion products on the faces and mouth moulding.




South Wales Type socketed axe - fragment (small find number 6)



Dimensions: Surviving length 60.8mm; width body below loop 37.7mm; external mouth dimensions 48.0mm (side to side) by 40.8mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 31.0mm (side to side) by 25.7mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 8.5 by 2.8mm; height 0.7mm; (2) 8.0 by 2.6mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 8.5 by 4.0mm; height 1.0mm; (4) 8.1 by 2.8mm; height 0.5mm; width loop 4.1-5.2mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 179.2g. 



This is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular shaped body in cross-section. The upper sides are slightly concave and slightly divergent. The loop is narrow and low, emerging significantly below the underside of the mouth moulding. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four prominent runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Three weakly defined and slightly divergent, longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. The casting flashes down both sides are prominent but blunted, indicating that they were hammered or filed down when the axe was prepared for use. On one face, near the break edge, there is a concave distortion and narrowing of the socket aperture, suggesting that this axe may have been struck with a blunt tool before being buried in the ground although no clear impact scar is visible on the surface remaining. The axe surfaces have extensive patches of blue corrosion products over upper faces, sides and mouth, suggesting that this axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.




South Wales Variant Type socketed axe - complete (metal-detector find 2)



Dimensions: Length 80.9mm; blade width 49.2mm; width body below loop 37.2mm; external mouth dimensions 46.2mm (side to side) by 40.1mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 28.5mm (side to side) by 23.8mm (front to back); dimensions runner stubs (1) 8.8 by 5.2mm; height 0.5mm; (2) 8.6 by 5.9mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 10.5 by 5.7mm; height 0.8mm; (4) 7.5 by 4.5mm; height 0.2mm; width loop 4.8-5.6mm; depth of socket approx. 62.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 255.2g. 



This is a complete and small bronze socketed axe with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding and a rectangular-shaped body in cross-section. The axe has slightly straight and divergent sides, which splay outwards markedly near the blade edge. The loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding and is narrow. The axe has a four-runner casting technology, the four runner-stubs spaced approximately 90 degrees apart around the four sides of the mouth. The exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. Five very prominent, longitudinal and ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, extending a little over half way down the length of the axe faces. The central three ribs are parallel, while the outer ribs define and follow the face edges and are slightly divergent. The casting seams are visible though not prominent, suggesting hammering or filing as preparation of the axe. Striations on the blade-bevel, mostly running parallel with the blade-edge indicate that the axe was sharpened for use. Thick and prominent patches of blue corrosion products are evident on the faces and loop-side of the axe and suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before burial. It is possible that the flat topped surfaces on the thick corrosion products present on one face of the axe may once have attached to the flat faces of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. The original surfaces of this axe have a green patina.




Ribbed socketed axe of South Wales Variant, with similarities to Type Sompting, Variant Roseberry Topping - complete (metal-detector find 4)



Dimensions: Length 114.5mm; blade width 50.5mm; width body below loop 37.2mm; external mouth dimensions 47.5mm (side to side) by 45.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 32.1mm (side to side) by 30.5mm (front to back); depth of socket approx. 84.0mm; width loop 9.6-11.0mm; weight (prior to conservation) 400.0g. 



This is a complete, large and heavy bronze socketed axe of blocky but slender proportions, with a pronounced, curved and onset collar, and an angular rectangular cross-section. The sides are slightly concave and divergent, giving a slightly flared form and with slight, but even widening near the blade ends. A wide and thick loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding. The external and internal outlines of the mouth are sub-square in plan and the axe has a deep front to back mouth. There are no clear runner stubs or scars evident around the mouth top. Five longitudinal and very pronounced ribs descend from the underside of the mouth moulding on each face, extending down two thirds of the length of the faces. The central three ribs are near parallel, while the outer ribs define and follow the face edges and are slightly divergent. On one face, there is a linear projecting ridge, between two ribs on the lower loop side, suggesting a flaw in the surface of the mould, from which the axe was cast. In side view, one of the faces has a marked 'bulge' or convex curvature half way down the face, suggesting an oddly shaped mould-half. The casting seams down each side of the axe are prominent but blunted, suggesting the seams were rapidly hammered down as the axe was prepared for use. On the blade bevel, there are striations parallel with the blade edge, indicating the axe was prepared for use. There are areas of concreted corrosion products on the sides and faces of the axe, of both green and blue colour, suggesting that the axe may have been burnt immediately before being buried. On one blade facet and on the lower loop side there are areas of concretion with markedly smooth upper surfaces, suggesting that this axe may have been placed immediately beside, and above or below other artefacts within the hoard group. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.




Croxton Type socketed axe - fragment (small find number 8) 



Dimensions: Surviving length 52.7mm; width body below loop 35.7mm; external mouth dimensions 40.7 mm (side to side) by 36.6mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 30.5mm (side to side) by 25.1mm (front to back); width loop 6.8-7.8mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 114.8g. 



This is a mouth and upper body fragment of a bronze socketed axe with a deep and onset collar and a sub-rectangular shaped body in cross- section. The upper sides are straight and slightly divergent. The loop is relatively high and wide, descending from within the lower part of the mouth moulding. The mouth moulding is slightly concave and everted in side profile, with no thickening or globularity evident near the mouth. The mouth top is flat but slightly angled with a raised inner edge and the exterior and interior outlines of the mouth are sub-rectangular shaped in plan. No runner scars or stubs are visible on the mouth. On one face, three longitudinal, narrow and strongly convergent ribs are visible, descending from the lower margin of the collar. These are poorly spaced at their origin, with one rib on the loop-side much more widely spaced away from the other two, descending from far over onto the non-loop side. On the reverse side, the ribs are largely obscured by surface corrosion products, though the upper section of one convergent rib on the loop-side is visible. The casting seams are visible down each side of the axe, but have been carefully filed down. One side and mouth of the axe is heavily encrusted with blue corrosion products, suggesting the axe was burnt immediately before burial. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina.

Combined weight (prior to conservation) 172.5g. 



This is an unusual, largely complete and slender, bronze socketed axe, with a tear and distortion down the non-loop side, from the mouth and along the casting seam. The axe has an everted mouth with a trumpet form and a deep onset collar. The mouth is damaged and distorted, but appears to have been near circular in external plan, though slightly sub-rectangular in its internal shape, and the mouth looks to have once had a deep front-to-back mouth. The mouth dimensions cannot now be accurately measured due to later damage and distortion. A low-set and slender loop, with a markedly rectangular shaped bar, descends from beneath the collar.



The upper socket is straight-sided the sides converging slightly. Half way down the axe, there is a distinct step and change of angle in the side profile, where the lower blade widens on both sides to give a step-waist effect. The slender lower blade has concave sides, widening to give a flaring blade form. This appears to be a composite socketed axe, where a socket has been cast on to a re-worked Winged Axe (or just possibly a Late Palstave). The upper face margins of the socket are defined by distinct single linear grooves ending in line with a square-ended ledge-stop across each mid-face. This is located 8-9mm below the point of the widening step visible on each side, thereby creating an overlapping join between the winged-axe blade-end and the cast on socket. The casting seams are prominent, but flattened indicating rapid filing or hammering down and the seams on the socket and blade end are in exact alignment.



The socket and mouth was split down its non-loop side along the casting seam, suggesting an outward pushing force, causing a split and distortion. Towards the base of the side split are lateral tears extending round to each face. A small mouth fragment from the non-loop side has conjoins with both mouth breaks, indicating that the axe is complete, but damaged. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina, though with areas of thick blue concretions on upper faces, one lower blade and side and inside the socket, suggesting the axe was burnt immediately before burial. At the base of the tapering sub-rectangular shaped socket, there is a green corroded concretion down one side.




Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Westow / Class D - complete (metal-detector find 5)



Dimensions: Length 107.7mm; surviving blade width 44.8mm; width body below loop 27.3mm; external mouth dimensions 32.7mm (side to side) by 31.6mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 23.4mm (side to side) by 23.0mm (front to back); dimensions of probable runner stub 6.7 by 3.5mm; height 0.7mm; dimensions of probable runner scar 6.0 by 3.0mm; depth 1.0mm; depth of socket approx. 73.0mm; width loop 5.2-5.6mm; weight (prior to conservation) 204.5g. 



This is a complete and slender bronze socketed axe with six facets and a deep, double mouth moulding. The sides are straight and slightly divergent with pronounced splaying and recurving at the blade-ends. The low and slender loop descends from the underside of the mouth moulding. The upper margin of the mouth moulding is defined by two curved horizontal ridges separated by a narrow groove and likewise, the lower margin also has a pair of curved horizontal ridges separated by a narrow groove. The two pairs of ridges are themselves separated by a wider, slightly recessed and concave band, making for a complex and unusual mouth moulding in combination. The external and internal outlines of the mouth are circular in plan shape. On one face side of the mouth top, there is a noticeable projection and on the opposing side, at 180 degrees to this, there is a corresponding scar, suggesting the existence of one runner-stub and one runner-scar and the use of a two-runner casting technology. The facet edges on the axe have rounded edges. The casting seams down each side are prominent but blunted, suggesting they were only rapidly hammered or filed when prepared for use. On the blade bevel there are striations running both parallel and at right angles to the blade edge, indicating that the blade was prepared for use. The faces, sides and mouth moulding of the axe are covered with blue corrosion products, suggesting that the axe was burnt immediately before burial. On one upper face, an area of blue corrosion product has a markedly flat top surface, which may once have attached to the flat face of another artefact placed immediately above or below this axe in the hoard group. On the blade end, the original surfaces have a green patina, while on the upper faces and mouth, the original surfaces have a grey-green patina.

Dimensions: Length 74.3mm; blade width 47.8mm; width body below loop 32.3mm; external mouth dimensions 39.3mm (side to side) by 32.4mm (front to back); internal mouth dimensions 30.1mm (side to side) by 25.3mm (front to back); depth of socket approx. 59.0mm; width loop 5.3-6.0mm; weight (prior to conservation ) 150.5g. 



This is a complete small, plain socketed axe of bronze, with a relatively broad body. The axe has a sub-rectangular sectioned body and mouth. The axe has a deep onset collar, which is flaring or trumpet shaped in profile. A low set and narrow loop emerges from the underside of the collar. The sides of the axe are slightly concave and diverge slightly, with marked expansion and recurving of the blade edge. There are no runner scars or stubs evident around the mouth top. The casting seams down each side of the axe are visible, but have been hammered or filed down before use. On the upper blade faces, there are blunt hammer mark depressions, indicating the expanded blade was worked before use. Striations running parallel with the blade-edge also indicate the blade was sharpened for use. The axe has a grey-green patina, with thick blue and green surface concretions evident in patches on the collar and blade surfaces. The blue concretions suggest that the axe may have been burnt immediately before being buried. On one blade bevel, there is a particularly thick area of blue surface concretion, with a markedly smooth and flat upper surface, suggesting this axe may have been placed immediately beside and above or below other artefacts in the hoard group.

Discussion: 



The bracelets/armrings described above can be best paralleled by objects from Ornament Horizon hoards of the Taunton phase (c.1400-1300 BC). During this phase many bracelets are more elaborate in the form or decoration (e.g. Rowlands 1971), and the Rockbourne examples are plain. They are, nevertheless, well paralleled by finds from the Monkswood hoard, Somerset (Smith 1959, Inv Arch GB. 42 2(1) & 2(2), see nos. 3-7), the Brading Marsh hoard (Isle of Wight), Hampshire (Rowlands 1976, 238), and Ebbesbourne Wake hoard, Wiltshire (Rowlands 1976, 271-21). For wider discussion of the ornament horizon and deposition of bracelets/armrings see Roberts (2007) and Wilkin (2017). 



Only fragments 1 & 2 have precise find spots, with these being very widely dispersed within the same field. Despite this, it is unlikely that three bronze age armlets of similar form would be separately deposited within such a small area, and on the balance of probability the group either represent a hoard disturbed by later cultivation, or were deposited as part of the same process. 



Conclusion:



As a find of three copper alloy objects of prehistoric  date, objects Nos. 1-3 qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002)

The blade is parallel sided with a tapered cutting edge on both sides. There is a high central rib on both faces giving a shallow lozengiform cross section.

Date: Middle bronze Age - c. 1500 - 1150 BC

Dimensions: 93.09 mm x 16.87 mm x 5.56 mm

Weight: 35.60 g



Peter Reavill (pers comm) has dated this to  c 1500 - 1150 BC and suggests that it is from the lower part of the blade where the lozengiform cross section would give greater strength and rigidity.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,35.6,,,5.56,93.09,1,Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen,Ciorstaidh Hayward Trevarthen,South West,Dorset,West Dorset,South Perrott,ST4707,Centred on field,50.86006836,-2.75440167,DOR-CA6F71,,CA6F71.jpg,Middle bronze Age blade fragment,Somerset County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/caht/CA6F71.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1063955.jpg
