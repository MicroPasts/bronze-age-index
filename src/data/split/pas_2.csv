Based on the line drawing this fragment has been reidentified as a group IV dirk or rapier, and not a dagger as previously suggested.

The axehead has an overall length of 122.7mm and weighs 270.7g. The butt is rounded and has a width of 20mm. The septum gradually thickens to the curved and prominent median bevel, positioned 55mm from the butt. The sides are comparatively straight and diverge slightly towards the blade, with a width at the median of 26.5mm and a width of 29mm before the sides expand to the blade. The sides are curved across their thickness. The flanges are lozenge-shaped and are longer at the rear. The flanges come to a point at the butt and because the butt is convex, it is visible as the characteristic 'projecting tongue' when viewed from the side. The flanges have a maximum breadth at the position of the median of 21.6mm. The blade side expands to produce a deep crescentic blade edge with a width of 69.6mm. Blade facets are evident c. 14mm from the blade edge and may have been highlighted by a low step upwards running across the blade which is discernible on both faces. There are striations running across the width of the axe positioned on the blade between the beginning of the flange and the stop, these may possibly be only evident here because of better surface preservation. The striations may have been intended as crude decoration. The axe has been recently treated with an applied coating. The surface, where it survives, has a dark green to black patina (exaggerated by the applied coating) and has a silvery tint, probably because of surface tin enrichment.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-03-01T00:00:00Z,,,,270.7,,,21.6,122.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Market Drayton,,,,,NMGW-D8EEE6,,2005.49.jpg,"Developed flat axe, probably Type Arreton and Early Bronze Age III date or metalworking stage five or Needham's Period 3, c. 2000-1700BC.",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.49.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/75342.jpg
105466,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-950,"Mouth fragment of cast copper-alloy socketed axehead dating to c. 1100-950 BC, or possibly a little later. It comes from a plain axe with a 'rope' upper mouth moulding. There is no indication of casting seams, meaning that it is a fragment of a face, not a side of the axe. Moreover, the mouth fragment comes from a mis-cast axe, as the thinness of one side/face and mouth moulding indicate. It is questionable whether or not it was ever used. If the mis-casting meant that it was too incomplete and the structure was too weak for use, it would have been recycled.

105795,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1200,-800,"A fragment from a small cast copper-alloy spearhead or arrowhead, likely to date from the late Bronze Age, from circa 1200 to 800 BC. The weapon is socketed (existing socket size 7.3 mm in diameter). The object is unfortunately broken at both the socketed end and the blade end. The result of the socket causes a convex ridge to run down the obverse and the reverse of the blade. In profile the object is therefore oval with a wing at either side. The edges of the blade begin to taper towards the break at the socketed end of the object, whilst the ridge caused by the socket continues to expand - the original socket size would therefore be somewhate larger than that which remains. Determining whether this find is an arrowhead or a spearhead is not aided by its fragmented nature, although socketed spearheads seem to be better attested than socketed arrowheads in the literature concerning the later Bronze Age. Examples of socketed spearheads are illustrated in Needham (1990, 55; 32/72, 47, 82) and Langmaid (1976, 53; 19).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2004-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,5.4,,,8.6,17.9,1,Tom Brindle,Tom Brindle,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,South Northamptonshire,Paulerspury,SP7144,GPS (from the finder),52.089803,-0.965132,NARC-5997F0,,NARC-5997F0spearheadsection.jpg,Fragment from a small late Bronze Age socketed spear or arrowhead,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-5997F0spearheadsection.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/73567.jpg

It was possibly used as an ear ring, although there are a number of other uses for such artefact types. One such use might be a link in a chain. A similar artefact is illustrated in Crummy (1983, 50; 1796) which is cited as being a possible Roman ear ring. However other penannular rings of a not dissimilar nature make up links from a possible chain mesh purse (Crummy 1983, 50; 1850). A definite function for such items is thus difficult to ascertain, and when discovered outside a stratified context determining a date is likewise problematic. They may date from as early as the Bronze Age, whilst they may be as late as post-medieval.","A further ring, similar in form although larger was found in the same area.

107225,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-700,"Incomplete copper alloy knife, or dagger. The dagger is leaf shaped, slender and roughly a pointed oval in cross-section. Either side of the blade there are developed bevels; two either side of the main ridge angling down towards the blade edge. The blade tapers towards the tip, which is now flat through wear rather than being pointed. The flat tip is well patinated, having the same patination as the blade body. The edges of the blade are damaged in places with small concave 'nicks', and are again covered with the same patination as the blade tip and body. The tang is roughly rectangular and flares slightly towards the gently curved and worn shoulders. There is a single rivet hole in the centre of the tang to attach it to the handle. The rivet hole is circa 4mm in diameter. The surface condition is very poor with extensive loss due to corrosion. Limited areas of original surface, patinated dark brown remain mainly on the tang and the tip-end of the blade. Elsewhere the surface is smooth and medium brown in colour. 


Dating is slightly problematic. In form the knife is similar to some small rivetted knife/daggers of the Camerton-Showshill phase of the late Early Bronze Age to early Middle Bronze Age, though they usually have a flat blade in cross-section. The blade section and rivet notches suggest a Middle Bronze Age date to be most likely, there are similar examples from Beck Row, Mildenhall (Pendleton 1999, Fig 51-206).


Locally, the blade is comparable to one from Bourne, Lincolnshire (Davey, 1973, fig. 19 no. 193, although classified as a dirk), another from Caenby, Lincolnshire (ibid, p90, fig 23, no. 220).











This object was found in association with other Bronze Age, Iron Age and early Roman material, including fIVE terret rings, as listed below. The terret rings were recorded under the Treasure Act (2006 T187) but were declared 'not treasure' due to a lack of evidence to relate them together. The assemblage as a whole however indicates that the site is significant, perhaps as a religious or cult centre.

110568,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1100,-600,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe fragment. This is a side fragment from near the blade of a socketed axe of undetermined type and dating from between 1100 and 600 BC. The fragment has a height of 32.5mm, a width of 24.3mm and a maximum thickness of 14.8mm (minimum thickness of 7.2mm). The axe was likely to have been made from a heavily-leaded bronze and the fragment weighs 51.8g. The base of the socket is visible at the top of the fragment with a surviving depth of 7.4mm. The side of the axe is slightly convex and is beginning to curve outwards at the bottom, probably implying a somewhat expanded blade edge. The casting seam is not visible on the side of the axe suggesting the axe was well-finished or used. Both faces of the axe have been heavily-battered, leaving pounding marks and partially closing the socket.

The pin is complete, but has distorted slightly near the tip and has an overall length of 99.2mm. The pin is of circular section with a diameter of between 3 and 4mm. The head forms a circular ring with an external diameter of 14.2mm (8mm internal). The ring is slightly open with a gap of c.0.5mm between the end of the ring and the neck. The neck forms the characteristic U-bend, before the near right-angle to the pin shaft (86mm in length). The diameter of the shaft is constant until c. 35mm from the tip, where the pin thins to the point. The only decoration evident on the pin is a single incised line on the front and sides of the head, 2mm from the end of the loop. The pin weighs 7.3g and is in good condition with much of the surface preserved and a mid-brown patina. This find represents the twelfth recorded find of ring-headed and swan’s-neck pins in South East Wales (comprising the old counties of Glamorgan & Gwent) (Gwilt in press), including the five recent examples excavated at Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan. Ring-headed pins of this form without a solid ring commonly carry simple decoration with notches on the front of the ring (Dunning 1934, pp274). The simple decoration on this form of pin can be paralleled with an example from Meare in Somerset (ibid. fig 3) and from Margan foreshore in Wales (Wear, unpublished) where an example has further notches along the neck and head. Few ring-headed pins have been recovered from a securely dated context, but the simple form and decoration on this example may suggest a date within the first half of the date range suggested above.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-03-31T23:00:00Z,,,,7.3,,4,,99.2,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9877,,51.482725,-3.4703,NMGW-62BF56,,2005.92.jpg,"Late Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age ring-headed type pin, c. 750-100BC.",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.92.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/78959.jpg
110606,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-950,"Late Bronze Age copper alloy palstave, probably of Type Guilsfield.



The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 147.6mm and is comparatively heavy at 477.1g, implying a heavily-leaded bronze. The butt is straight (23mm wide) and is angled slightly towards the unlooped side. The septum is thick, as is typical for the type, with a thickness at the butt of 6mm and 14mm at the base of the stop. The septum is slightly concave across its width. The flanges are concave and end well before the butt (18mm). The sides before the stop are straight. The stop is rounded, suggesting the type to be 'Guilsfield' and projects prominently above the blade surface. The top of the stop overhangs the septum with a height of 18-19mm. At the stop, the palstave blade has a width of 28.4mm (42.4mm including the loop) and has a thickness of 31.1mm. The sides of the blade are concave and diverge to a narrow and gently curving blade of 45.6mm width. Both sides exhibit the casting seams, which have been finished, probably initially through hammering and then filing, the seam on the unlooped side appears less well finished than the corresponding seam. The sides are comparatively straight across their thickness. The loop has an external width of 26.3mm (13.1mm internal), a maximum thickness of 9.1mm and projects 14mm above the side of the palstave. The exterior of the loop carries small faceting, possibly as a result of multi-directional filing. The blade has a comparatively deep convex curve near the stop, which becomes weaker as it approaches the edge, the blade is otherwise undecorated. Both blades display neat and systematic hammer-marks. The blade edge has been lost but prominent sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces. The palstave has good surface preservation with a mid to dark green patina. Small areas of surface damage and possible bronze disease are visible on the edges and a small recent scrape is visible on one flange, possibly as a result of excavation.","This palstave is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975. The hoard consists of another similar palstave (NMGW-759FC0), a socketed axe (NMGW-75C4F7), a socketed gouge (NMGW-75FE70) and a blade of an uncertain object (NMGW-7621D3).



Both palstaves in this assemblage (this one and NMGWPA 2005.93.2) share many features and are similar in size and weight. Differences in the recurved blade may be a result of eroded blade tips on NMGWPA 2005.93.1, which is generally slightly less well preserved. It appears likely that both palstaves were produced at the same time and possibly from the same mould pairs. Within Wales, as the type may suggest, the palstaves can be best paralleled with the palstaves recovered amongst the hoard found at Guilsfield, Powys. One palstave in particular shares the same flange profile and drop from the stop onto the blade (Savory 1966, Fig.1 (14)). 



This hoard can be fairly confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, resolution within this time period however, is problematic and requires metallurgical analysis to resolve. The palstaves (NMGWPA 2005.93.1-2) are suggested as being of 'Guilsfield' type and suggest manufacture during the Wilburton metalworking industry. Wilburton metalworking corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6 and is dated to c. 1150-950 BC. The socketed axe (NMGWPA 2005.93.3) of Type Gillespie can be dated from late Wilburton to Ewart Park (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pp 193), although Wilburton associations are known (ibid.). Savory (1980, pp 55)1 has suggested that a simple mouth moulding on socketed gouges suggests a later date within the type, probably implying a Ewart Park date for the gouge NMGWPA 2005.93.4, within Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950-750BC, though socketed gouges are known from the Wilburton phase.



The highly tentative parallel drawn between the blade fragment NMGWPA 2005.93.5 and the Acton Park hoard may present a slight possibility of an earlier association dating to the later Middle Bronze Age and of Acton 2 metalworking stage, corresponding to Needham's (ibid.) Period 5 and dated to c. 1500-1150BC. However, the blade may also plausibly represent the lower part of a tanged chisel, such as those seen in the Late Bronze Age hoards from Penwyllt, Powys, and Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No.284(9); No.288(3)).

The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 141.0mm and is comparatively heavy at 483.7g, implying a heavily-leaded bronze. The butt has a width of 24.7mm and is irregular, appearing to have suffered from casting problems with the bronze at the surface appearing to be porous, there is also some hollowing on both sides of the septum adjacent to the butt. This damage may be a result of insufficient bronze when casting. The butt was likely to have been straight and angled slightly towards the unlooped side. The septum is thick, as is typical for the type, with a thickness at the butt of 5mm and 15mm at the base of the stop. The flanges are concave and end well before the butt (17mm), with the flanges on the looped side appearing shorter than on the other. The sides before the stop are straight. The stop is rounded, suggesting the type to be 'Guilsfield' and projects prominently above the blade surface. The top of the stop overhangs the septum with a height of 18-19mm. At the stop the palstave blade has a width of 28.3mm (43.0mm including the loop) and has a thickness of 33.4mm. The sides of the blade are concave and diverge to a slightly expanded blade, producing a curved blade edge of 50.0mm width. Both sides exhibit the casting seams, which have been finished, probably initially through hammering and then filing. The sides are comparatively straight across their thickness. The loop has an external width of 27.9mm (13.9mm internal), a maximum thickness of 9.4mm and projects 15mm above the side of the palstave. The exterior of the loop carries small faceting, possibly as a result of multi-directional filing. The blade has a comparatively deep convex curve near the stop, which becomes weaker as it approaches the edge, the blade is otherwise undecorated. Both blades display some hammer-marks. The blade edge survives near the unlooped side and prominent sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces. Deep striations are also present running up the blade. The palstave has good surface preservation with a black patina at the rear and dark brown patina on the blade.","This palstave is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975.

The axe is complete, although the blade edge has been lost and the axe has an overall length of 87.6mm and weighs 129.2g. The mouth is oval with an external width of 35.7mm and an external thickness of 33.2mm (internal - 27.8mm x 24.7mm). The socket has a depth of 74mm and becomes sub-rectangular in section c. 25mm from the mouth. The rim has been carefully finished and no evidence of the casting runner stubs survives. The pronounced flaring, trumpet-shaped mouth is 13mm deep. The separation of the mouth and face is defined by a rounded collar moulding, which is deeper on the mouth side to accentuate the flaring trumpet mouth. The loop begins at the collar moulding and has an external length of 21.3mm (11.6mm internal) and rises to a height of 10mm, with a width of 7.8mm. The casting seams are visible down both sides and have been neatly finished, particularly on the area between the blade and loop. The sides are straight before the blade, where the sides expand and are recurved, producing an expanded cutting edge. Beneath the collar moulding the axe has the hexagonally-faceted form. The faces are slightly convex and rounded. The blade is distinct and begins 15mm from the current edge. Sharpening striations are evident running along both sides of the blade. The axe has generally good surface survival with some damage to the blade. The axe has a patchy black patina and elsewhere has a pale to mid green patina.","This socketed axe is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975.

110706,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age copper alloy socketed gouge.



The socketed gouge is near-complete and has broken in antiquity at the mouth. The gouge may be judged slender with a maximum external diameter at the mouth of 20.2mm (15.6mm internal). The gouge has an overall length of 86.0mm and weighs 46.0g. The mouth is simple and has no mouldings around it. The gouge has a subtle collar 12mm deep. The sides of the gouge are gently concave and converge towards the blade edge. The casting seams are high and have undergone minimal finishing. The gouge groove begins 31mm from the mouth. The blade edge has been lost and it is now unclear weather the blade originally expand at the sides. The blade has a width of 14mm. Sharpening striations are evident running off the blade edge (at 90 degrees) on the face and are angled (at approximately 45 degrees) on the rear of the blade. The gouge generally has good surface survival and has a black or pale green patina. Areas of active bronze corrosion are present at the mouth and on the blade. Savory (1980, pp 55) suggests that earliest socketed gouges such as those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings, whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar.","This gouge is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975. The hoard consists of two palstaves (NMGW-632296; NMGW-759FC0), a socketed axe (NMGW-75C4F7), and a blade of an uncertain object (NMGW-7621D3).



This hoard can be fairly confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, resolution within this time period however, is problematic and requires metallurgical analysis to resolve.



David Coombs (1971, 251ff.; 2001, 288) presented a four category typology based on the shape and style of socketed gouges in south east England. This gouge might be most accurately placed within his Class I category, which is characterised by a plain collar and narrow blade. Classes of gouges are difficult to distinguish chronologically, but can be broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age, particularly the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalworking phases (c.1150-750 BC), though different forms continue in use into the Early Iron Age. Savory (1980, 55) has suggested that simple mouth mouldings on socketed gouges suggest a later date within the type, probably implying a Ewart Park date for the gouge, within Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950-750BC.

110707,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Bronze Age copper alloy blade fragment from an uncertain artefact.



The implement is incomplete and has broken in antiquity before the blade and has a surviving length of 54.6mm. The piece has been cast in a simple one-piece mould and has undergone no further finishing. At the break the piece has a width of 16.4mm. The sides are curved and diverge sharply to define an expanded blade with a crescentic edge. The implement is flat with a thickness at the break of 4.2mm and 3.2mm at the blade, and weighs 40.1g. Both faces are irregular as would be expected, given that the piece is from the mould. The upper face has a general silver colour, probably because of tin surface enrichment but also has patches of a pale to mid green patina. The underside has a general pale green patina. The implement is an unusual constituent within an assemblage, not least because it has undergone no finishing and may be seen as coming straight from the mould.



A parallel for the piece is from the Acton Park (Wrexham) hoard, where an unusual implement interpreted as a possible chisel was found associated with primary shield pattern palstaves (Savory 1980, No.262 (7), Fig.30). The Acton Park chisel is of similar blade dimensions, is also 'as cast', is flat and has a wide expanded blade. The Acton Park piece however is complete and has flanged sides, since this item has broken before the position of the flanges any identification is speculative. Alternatively, and perhaps more plausibly, this might represent a broken blade of a later tanged chisel, broken below any tang or collar. Tanged chisels are known from a variety of Late Bronze Age contexts such as the hoards from Penwyllt, Powys, and Brogyntyn, Shropshire (Savory 1980, No.284(9); No.288(3)).","This object is part of a hoard of five objects, found around 1975.

The fragment has broken in antiquity and has a surviving length of 74.6mm and weighs 139.8g. The fragment encompasses the upper end of the blade, the stop and the majority of the septum. The septum has a surviving length of 45mm and is broken at an angle. It is possible that the position at the end of the septum is the butt of the palstave, although this can not be demonstrated. The septum is comparatively flat and has a thickness of 6-7mm. Both of the sides are straight for the length of the fragment. The flanges are eroded, but are unlikely to have arched any higher than the maximum thickness at the stop, which is 23.2mm. No loop or remnants are evident on the sides and the casting flashes are no longer visible. The stops are straight and right-angled to the flanges. One of the stops has a large aperture (12mm wide and 13mm deep) as a result of casting problems. The stop is raised above the level of the blade and slopes down to the blade.

The chisel is complete except for the missing blade edge and has an overall length of 85.5mm and weighs 23.1g. The tang (48mm length) is of square section, which diverges towards the prominent shoulder moulding or 'collar'. At the collar the chisel has a width of 12.3mm, thickness of 8.8mm. The collar moulding has a length of 6mm, converges towards the blade and appears to be slightly concave along its length. The sides of the blade are concave producing an expanded blade edge with a surviving width of 28.2mm. The chisel has a mid-brown patina with some surface survival. Some surface striations are evident on one face and running at an angle across the blade, it is unclear whether the striations are the result of sharpening.","Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales.

117674,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-800,"A fragment of cast bronze axe. The fragment consists of the cutting edge and a small portion of the lower blade of a Mid - Late Bronze Age axe or palstave (1500 - 800 BC). The fragment is D or crescent shaped in plan with a curved convex cutting edge. In section the axe fragment is sub-triangular. The convex cutting edge of the axe fragment, although pitted through corrosion and slightly abraded by the soil, is worn and shows areas of possible sharpening. There is little evidence for the sides tapering inwards above the cutting edge. This is due to a large lateral break which has removed this part of the blade from the rest of the axe-head. This break seems to have occurred relatively recently as the edges are fresh, jagged and show no evidence of abrasion. The area of the break is heavily pitted with small hollows which may have weakened the structure of the blade at this point. The fragment of axe is a dark mid-green brown colour with an even but corroded patina. There are a number of patches of light green powdery (active) corrosion and areas of corrosive pitting present. The area around the break is a mid orange colour; this may be due to the burial conditions or the presence of iron objects in the plough soil. The fragment measures 59.2mm width, 18.7mm length, and is 7.7mm thick. It weighs 21.6 grams. It is very difficult with such a small fragment of metalwork to tell which type of axe it is from; it is most likely to be from either a palstave of Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150 BC) date or a socketed axe of the Late Bronze Age (1150–800BC).",,4,,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-10-06T23:00:00Z,,,,21.6,,,7.7,59.2,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Bayston Hill,SJ5109,From finder,52.676474,-2.726155,HESH-A938D2,,HESH-A938D2 illustration.jpg,Bronze Age Axe - Blade fragment,Finder,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-A938D2 illustration.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/89091.jpg

117982,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1275,"Middle Bronze Age copper alloy looped palstave probably dating to c. 1400-1275 BC.



The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 124.85mm. The butt is straight, with a width of 19.76mm and is comparatively thick with a thickness of 5.6mm. The sides are straight and parallel as far as the blade and have a width of 22.7mm. Casting seams are evident on both sides and have been finished. The loop is intact and is a little irregular with a length of 22.32mm (4.72mm internal), a height of 8.30mm and a thickness of 7.49mm. The flanges begin from the septum, before the butt and reach their maximum height (25.94mm) a little before the stop. The septum is concave and has a maximum length of 49mm. The stops are undercut and are straight with rounded corners. The stops have an internal width of 16.3mm (22mm width at the stop) and are 11.7mm high. The stops are raised (5-6mm) above the level of the blade. The blade sides are gradually divergent to the position of the blade facet, where they out-turn to produce a moderately expanded blade with a surviving width of 54.57mm (damage to blade tips). The blade facets begin 11mm from the curving blade edge. The blade is decorated with a high and prominent mid-rib, flanked on each side by a weaker and shorter curving rib. The palstave weighs 273.7g. The surface of the palstave is generally poorly preserved and has been lost on one face. Where the surface survives, the bronze has a black patina, elsewhere the bronze is pale green.","The palstave is a Low-flanged (broad-blade), Group III palstave, probably a variant of either Type Sleaford or Type Carleton, with flanges which begin from the septum and curve to their highest point before the stop. The blade sides are curved to an expanded blade, with uncertain blade tip treatment. The decoration on the face is unusual where the mid-rib is flanked by weaker curving ribs, which may be considered to be a variant of the flange extensions, common on Type Sleaford. 'Low Flanged' palstaves belong to Taunton metalworking stage (1400-1275 cal. BC; Needham et al. 1997), corresponding to Cemmaes metalworking in Wales.

118122,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"A terminal fragment of a Late Bronze Age gold bracelet. It has a surviving length of 38.95mm, probably representing approximately one third of the original length. The 'buffer' terminal is flat and circular with a diameter of 9.66mm to 10.30mm and has a length of 5mm. The bracelet fragment has a minimum width beneath the flaring terminal of 5.79mm. The terminal displays numerous facets, presumably resulting from forging the circular-sectioned terminal. The sides of the bracelet are straight and diverge to the break where the bracelet is comparatively wide for the type at 12.56mm. The bracelet sides are 'worked-up' to form low flanges or lips on both faces with a thickness of 1.51mm (at the break) to 3mm (near the terminal) and are slightly faceted across their thickness. These flanges remain sharp and prominent on the exterior face, but appear lower on the interior of the bracelet, possibly as a result of wear. The 'ribbon' faces have been hammered flat and are plain, with a thickness of 1.1mm at the break and thickening towards the terminal. The break appears to be deliberate and may have been cut and torn to separate; cracks resulting from metal stress are evident near the break. Two incised and roughly parallel lines on the terminal may be contemporary with the use or production of the bracelet. The bracelet fragment has a weight of 10.90g.



Non-destructive semi-quantitative SEM-EDX analysis was carried out by Mary Davis. Five areas on the bracelet were tested; the results varied considerably, depending on the level of wear, damage or scraping beneath the tested area. The gold composition varied between 78% - 97%, silver 2% - 14% and copper 1% - 8%. The scraped and damaged areas show a general composition consistent with similar material from Wales (Taylor (1980); Aldhouse-Green & Northover (1996)) and from Late Bronze Age bracelets from England analysed by Hook & Needham (1989). The depletion of silver and copper on the smooth and worn areas demonstrates a similar effect to other recently analysed prehistoric jewellery thought to have been in contact with the skin, which differs drastically to the analysis of protected and recessed areas on the same artefact.","This form of bracelet has been recognised by Taylor (1984) as a type, which she has termed the 'Potterne Type', after a similar bracelet found at Potterne, Wiltshire. The form corresponds to Hook and Needham's (1989) Class B1 bracelet (which may or may not have the flanges). Hook and Needham list 21 examples of Class B1 and related bracelets from Britain and Europe, with a clear concentration of the type in southern England and with a band stretching across north Wales and Cheshire. This example represents the first recorded example from south Wales.



The parallel from Potterne is of very similar form but is slightly more slender with a maximum width of 8.25mm. Other examples of the Potterne type have been found at Llanarmon-yn-Iân in Denbighshire (Green 1984) where a heavily worn bracelet with smaller terminals but of the same type was found with other gold items (a bracelet, an ingot and a link) and deposited within the socket of a faceted axe of type Gillespie. Excavations at Brean Down, Somerset revealed an associated pair of Potterne Type bracelets and possibly a small fragment from a third. The Brean Down examples are also more slender with maximum widths of 8.2 and 9.2mm. The dating of this bracelet type can be confidently placed in the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7 and dated to 950 - 750BC. The Llanarmon-yn-Iân bracelet was associated with a faceted axe of Ewart Park date, the Potterne find is thought to have been associated with the settlement rather than the midden with a suggested date in the mid 8th century BC. The Brean Down finds may be slightly earlier with a proposed date within the 10th - 9th centuries BC (Bell, 1990 pp71, 108).",3,Gold,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-07-31T23:00:00Z,,,,10.9,,,3,38.95,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Cowbridge with Llanblethian,ST0074,,51.456117,-3.440658,NMGW-E48854,,2005.147.jpg,Late Bronze Age Potterne Bracelet,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.147.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/87958.jpg
118203,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1950,-1700,"Incomplete Early Bronze Age bronze developed flat axe (or flanged axe), probably of Class 4E (following Needham forthcoming), corresponding with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) type Bandon and with Type Derryniggin (Harbison 1969) in Ireland. Axes of these types date towards the end of the Early Bronze Age: Needham's (1996) Period 3 c.1950 - 1700 BC/Needham et al.'s (1997) Willerby phase.



The axehead is eroded with very little of the original surface surviving, making it difficult to determine whether the axe is broken or complete. The axe is now comparatively small with an overall surviving length of 66.13mm. The butt is likely to be damaged with a thickness of 7.5mm. The axe has a width of 18.66mm at the butt, which is concave. The sides are convex across their thickness with a maximum thickness (on the blade) of 11.01mm. The sides are fairly straight and slightly divergent before the blade facet, after which they expand sharply to produce a moderately expanded and curved blade edge with a width of 44.45mm. The axe thickens to a point approximately 16mm from the butt, where there is the suggestion of a poorly preserved median bevel, if correct, then this would suggest the axe has lost the butt end. The axe has a width of 19.92mm at the proposed median bevel. The face edges are now eroded but were raised. The blade facet is evident, approximately 20mm from the blade edge. The axe has poor surface preservation and is heavily pitted with a mid green to pale brown patina. The axe currently weighs 98.9g.","The axe can be paralleled with a number of similar axes. Within the National Museum of Wales' collections similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750-1600 BC.



Class 4E axes are widely distributed across Britain. In Wales, approximately 13 certain or probable Class 4E axes are currently known. Several are decorated (e.g. Llanbradig, Isle of Anglesey NMGW-6152E8), but the majority are undecorated.

The nature of the corrosion, with blue patches and analysis of past flat axes suggest the material is more likely to be copper rather than copper alloy. The axe is complete, but the surface has been heavily abraded, therefore only traces of a heavy green/brown patina. 

In plan the axe is a sub elongated triangle. The butt is rounded, and in profile gradually tapers to a rounded edge. The sides are straight with no flaring outwards of the blade tip. The blade cutting edge appears to have been sharpened, suggesting the axe was functional rather than votive. In profile the blade forms a ‘>’. The cutting edge is symmetrical.

The axe is a flat axe, which dates to the early Bronze Age, c. 2000 to 1600 BC.

123389,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1200,-1050,"A copper-alloy cast spearhead from the transition of the middle to late Bronze Age. The spear head is a native type, of basal-looped design of the Penard industry. It measures 201 mm in length. The blade is triangular in shape, tapering from 41.6 mm to 11.1 mm at the end of the blade which is missing its tip. The blade emerges from the socket at 81.7 from the base of the socket. At each side of the blade is a loop at the point where blade and socket meet. The beginning of the blade juts out at right angles from these loops.  The socket is 22.5 mm in diameter at its opening and is hollow for 132.5 mm down the shaft, well into the blade of the spearhead. The bulb of the socket continues right down to the tip of the blade, making the blade look like a circle with wings in section. It tapers to 3.7 mm at the broken tip of the blade. On the blade, either side of the socket bulb is a slight depression running to the tip of the blade. This is apparent on both sides of the blade. 

The Penard phase occurred at the very beginning of the Late Bronze Age, owing some of its stylistic features to Middle Bronze Age technologies. This spearhead is likely to date from circa 1200 to 1050 BC. Similar examples are illustrated in Langmaid (1976, 52; 18a/b).    

This spearhead is in reasonably good condition. It is missing its tip and is a little ragged along the edges of the blade. It also suffers from mild bronze corrosion, but otherwise it has a rich dark green patina. There is an element of scratching on the surface, particularly one side of the socket. As these scratches reveal a different patina to the rest of the artefact it would appear that they are quite recent, and not a result of ancient wear.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Gardening,1985-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,186,,,22.5,201,1,Tom Brindle,Tom Brindle,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,Wellingborough,,SP8769,From a paper map,52.312227,-0.725248,NARC-C411F6,,NARC-C411F6BAspearhead.jpg,Late Bronze Age copper-alloy spearhead of Pennard phase,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/NARC-C411F6BAspearhead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/93179.jpg

Three quarters of the length of the tool gradually tapers towards the terminal. This terminal is thought to be the blade. In profile it has a ‘>’ shape which Phil Watson (Principle Curator, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) suggests it may have been used as a chisel rather than an awl. The last quarter of the tool quickly tapers to a blunt point. The corners are rounded compared to the sharp corners on the rest of the tool. This final quarter also has a different corrosion pattern to the majority of the surface. The majority of the surface has traces of a dark green patina, otherwise it is a matte mottled brown/green colour. The final quarters’ surface is a light powdery green with patches of orange stains. This is probably the tang for the handle, and the thickening approximately a quarter from the handle terminal is probably where the handle was wedged in place.

The blade is slightly bent at the mid point, which is not intentional, but it is not certain when this occurred. At the widest part of the blade there is an integral stop ridge. This ridge is sub-circular in plan and is perpendicular to the blade and tang.

The spearhead is of side-looped type and is near-complete, missing only the base of the socket and the side loops. The spearhead has a surviving length of 82.70mm. The socket tapers towards the blade and has a maximum surviving diameter of 9.47mm. The remnants of the upper attachment only of the side loops are evident on each side of the socket. The socket has an oval hole (24.82mm x 5.6mm) on one side; the hole is likely to be a casting problem, probably as result of a misaligned core, rather than subsequent damage. The blade is eroded (with a maximum width of 11.03mm) and is leaf- or flame-shaped. The end of the socket develops into a high mid-rib, which converges towards the tip and gives the blade a lozenge shaped section. The spearhead has lost much of the original surface and now has a dark brown patina, with some areas of bronze around the hole in the socket. The spearhead weighs 16.7g.","The spearhead can be paralleled with a number of examples recovered from Wales and beyond, including Cadoxton-Juxta-Neath (Neath Port Talbot) Llanerfyl (Powys) and Nantwnlle (Ceredigion) (Savory, 1980, Nos. 227, 229 and 337 respectively). The Cadoxton-Juxta-Neath and Llanerfyl examples are of Acton Park metal, while the Nantwnlle example is of Cemmaes metal (ibid.).



This spearhead has been published by Richard Davis (2012, 105, No.638, Pl.36) within his Group 6 Unclassified (developed side-looped).



Davis notes almost 500 Group 6 spearheads from across Britain dating to the Middle Bronze Age, which have a broad distribution. Davis' spearhead sub-types 6A, 6B and 6C are particularly prevalent across Wales, all of which have 'flame-shaped' blades, which might strengthen the idea that this spearhead originally had a flame-shaped blade, rather than a leaf-shaped blade.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,16.7,,9.47,,82.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Ruth Battye,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Llantrisant,,,,,NMGW-022DC1,,2005.208.jpg,Middle Bronze Age socketed spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rbattye/2005.208.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/90045.jpg
127695,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1450,-1250,"A cast copper alloy palstave with central rib, shield shaped pattern below the stop ridge, and raised flange facets. The palstave dates from the Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150 BC). It measures 149.4mm long and weighs 451 grams.






The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 82.4mm long and the width of cutting edge is 58.2mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 7.2mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 18.9mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 31.9mm). Beneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a tapering central rib. This rib extends approximately half way down the length of the blade, terminating in a rounded point. The rib itself, although present on both sides, is crisper and less eroded on one of the two faces. Directly below the stop ridge is a concave depression which is bordered by raised ridges that join with the central rib to create a trident (3 pronged fork) like shield shape. The convex cutting edge of the blade is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This is partially due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion. On the lower part of the blade and the cutting edge are a series of small irregular crescent shaped hammer marks / scars which are most evident in oblique light. Many of these scars overlap. This suggests that the cutting edge has been reshaped and sharpened by hammering a number of times.






The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 65.1mm long, 16.3mm wide and 7.2mm thick. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The width at the butt is 24.8mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. However, one face of the axe has been severally damaged by abrasion and corrosion which renders comparison between the two faces difficult. Both sides of the axe are scarred with the remains of linear ribs which extend from the butt to the cutting edge. These ribs are from the two part mold used to cast the axe. Both edges have been trimmed and filed to remove any excess metal.






The palstave is a mid brown colour with a thick well formed patina which covers part of the surface of the axe. In a number of places the patina has been removed by abrasion, where this has occurred a light bright green copper corrosion has developed. It is likely that this corrosion has spread and affected 50% of the surface of the axe. The majority of the abrasion is located on one face of the axe. This confirms the finders' suggestion that the axe was located just above the interface between the ploughsoil and the undisturbed layers beneath. It is also noted that the weight of this axehead is extremely heavy in comparison to other similar examples; this is especially the case when the abrasion and damage is taken into account. Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in: Savory, 1980; Catalogue of the Bronze Age collections in the National Museum of Wales; entry 151 from Ceulan-y-maesmawr, Cardiganshire. This form and style of palstave fits into the Acton Park metal working tradition which is dated to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC.

130491,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,,"A probable Bronze Age knife of the Urnfield tradition. It measures 164mm in length (although it is slightly bent in profile) and with a max width of 28mm just behind the tang. The tang is a faceted circle in section, max 8mm diameter and 18.5mm long.
The top of the knife is 6mm wide, narrowing to the sharp blade which thins in width to the point.
Brendan O'Connor comments ""This is a single-edged tanged knife.  The turned-up point indicates that the blade is very worn.  There is decoration on the blade, but I cannot make it out very well.
 
This is a continental Urnfield type.  Without consulting many more sources than I have to hand, I would not like to say whereabouts it came from;  while it could be central Europe, these knives are also found in France.
 
Wear has distorted the form of the blade, though there still appears to be a curve on the back towards the tang.  The tang itself is plain, but tapering in form.  This makes a relatively simple form - many knives have more complex tangs, which I would say is neither very early (like the knife in the Penard phase hoard from Ffynonnau), nor characteristic of the latest Urnfield phase, Hallstatt B3 equivalent to Ewart Park/Carp's Tongue in Britain.  That would suggest an origin roughly equivalent to the British Wilburton phase, probably before 1000 BC, but would not necessarily date its deposition in Wiltshire as something of an antique"".

The decoration is grooved and on both faces of the knife takes the form of five three-rings-and-dot behind the tang. It is rather jagged in places and gives the impression of a curvy edge to the rings.
Between these and the point of the knife, again on both sides, are three incised lines between which are two lines of Us, one line of which are inverted.
The decoration is rather crude and along the lines are several places where the line is wider than need be. Another curiousity is an apparant thin line of copper alloy added after the decoration, running across it vertically. It is only 1mm wide but clearly was applied afterwards - for what reason? Perhaps to cover a mistake, though it is rather randomly placed when much of the knife is quite crude.
The patina is very shiny and the metal a yellowy brassy colour. The tang and tip of the knife have darker green areas of patination. One side of the blade may have been recently cleaned - very shiny yellow-bronze diagonal striations show on the surface.
The knife weighs 96.71g. While it is very likely this is a knife of the Urnfield tradition, it is very unlikely that it was deposited in Wiltshire at the time. It may then be a more recent loss.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-02-10T00:00:00Z,,,,1.36,,,1,15,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Chirton,SU0757,From a paper map,51.312072,-1.900955,WILT-658D62,,Knife.jpg,(Possibly) Bronze Age knife,Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khinds/Knife.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/99404.jpg

The entire object is evenly pitted on its surface with the pitting varying between 1mm and 4mm in diameter.  The blade end of the axehead is 50mm in length while the haft end is at least 38mm in length.  The butt has worn away, but it can be estimated that the full length of the haft end was 42-45mm, estimated from tapering of the septum.  The flange facets extend out from the septum by 3mm at most.

130594,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-950,-800,"A Late Bronze Age socketed gouge made from cast copper alloy. The gouge is complete, but the surface is in poor condition. Approximately half of the patina remains otherwise the surface is pitted and has areas of corrosion. The patina is a mottled dark green colour. The gouge is a sub-rectangle in plan, with the socketed terminal being slightly flared. It measures 95.41mm long and weighs 74.5g. The socket is circular in section, 13.85mm diameter, and tapers in the internal diameter. The opposite terminal, the blade edge is ‘C’ shaped in section. The blade is the terminal of a elongated triangular groove on the upper surface of the gouge. This groove starts 23mm from the socket and gradually increases in depth and width towards the blade terminal. Patina remains in the groove and has fine striations running from the mid point of the groove to the blade edge.

The gouge dates to the late Bronze Age, c.1150 to c.800 BC. Similar examples are found in Watson (Watson, P. 1993 Catalogue of British and European Prehistoric Metalwork in Birmingham City Museums BAR British Series 233) illustrates two gouges, but one is decorated with ribbing (No. 72), and the second (No. 73) is undecorated, but is shorter, and the length of the groove is considerably shorter than the recorded example. A more similar example is illustrated in Annable and Simpson (Annable, F. and Simpson D. 1964 Guide Catalogue of the Neolithic and Bronze Age Collections in Devizes Museum Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society), No. 645.  Gouges were used as wood-working tools. 

Dr. Adam Gwilt (National Museum and Galleries of Wales) commented on the gouge;  “Plain forms are the most common from the Late Bronze Age. Where dated by association, they usually belong to the Ewart Park phase (950-800BC). Examples with mouth mouldings tend to be earlier and belonging to the Wilburton / Blackmoor phases (1150-920BC)”",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-01-01T00:00:00Z,2006-02-21T00:00:00Z,,,,,13.85,,95.41,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Wyre Forest,Ribbesford,SO7673,From a paper map,52.354533,-2.353801,WAW-890416,,WAW-890416 Drawing.jpg,"Bronze Age Gouge (top, reverse, and section) ",Candy Stevens,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW-890416 Drawing.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/99635.jpg
130667,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"A Bronze Age spearhead made of cast copper alloy. The spearhead is socketed; this socket is circular in plan, 18.92mm diameter at the entrance. The edge of the socket is abraded and uneven, but not all this damage occurred recently as there is a patina over the breaks. The socket tapers towards the tip of the blade. Below the blade, on opposite sides there is an integral loop. Each loop has a pointed oval vertical face, whose corners bends and meets the exterior of the socket. The loops are clogged with soil, as is the socket. The blade starts approximately at mid point along the socket and forms a leaf-shape in plan. The edges of the blade are heavily abraded.

This artefact has an incomplete circular socketed terminal at one end (diameter: as above; thickness of metal: 2mm), with the inside of the chisel being hollow to the opposing tip.  To the either side of the chisel’s length, there is a singular casting line or mark (average width: 1.5mm) ‘of the joint of the mould in which it was cast’ (Evans, 1881, page 172).  From the incomplete socketed mouth of the chisel, the form and length of the artefact adapts into an angular and ‘V’-shaped section, which then narrows to a point at the chisel edge.  The artefact is in a slightly worn but good condition with a dark green patina and small infrequent areas of pitting on the surface.

Treasure report written by Dr S.P. Needham: The fragment comprises one end of a ribbon of gold the sides converging in a convex curve towards a perforated terminal. The long edges are thickened outside a light crease inset by 1mm. The terminal's end has been torn off leaving just half of the perforation extant.


The ribbon has a number of buckles and a partial fracture crossing transversely at one point.","Treasure report written by Dr S.P. Needham: This is very likely to be an ancient object (over 300 years old) and may be of future research interest if better parallels come to light.













The incomplete nature of this object and the lack of diagnostic features makes it difficult to identify its original form. A range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings. It is possible that the Brixham Deverill fragment belongs to this repertoire and the composition of the metal would not be inconsistent with such a date.

 











Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 85-87 %, a silver content of 11-13 %, the remainder being copper. The fragment weighs 1.23 grams.

In plan the axe is a sub elongated trapezoid with a rounded butt and flared blade. The butt is rounded, and in profile tapers to a rounded edge. The edges of the septum and body are slightly raised, forming a slight flange. The blade flares outwards, but the blade tips are abraded and therefore rounded.

The chisel is comparatively small, with a distorted length of 50.83mm (c. 54mm undistorted). The artefact is thickest at its middle (at 3.18mm) and thins to the blade and tang end. The sides are divergent and straight along the tang and gently curved along the blade. The blade edge has a width of 16.84mm and is also gently curved. Little of the original surface survives, which appears to have had a black patination. The current surface is mid-green to brown. The chisel weighs 6.2g. Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the chisel was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The object was examined whole within the specimen chamber and analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. A scrape along one edge of the object allowed analysis of the metal in this area. Unfortunately the electron beam was too unsteady to obtain reliable semi-quantitative results, but a series of readings showed that the object was of tin bronze; neither zinc nor lead were present in detectable quantities. The suggested composition would be broadly consistent with Middle Bronze Age metal composition, perhaps Taunton or Cammaes metalworking.","This chisel has proved difficult to closely parallel, although the form and style seem consistent with Bronze Age types. The Sparkford Hill Hoard, Somerset (Smith Ed., 1959, Inventaria Archaeologia; An Illustrated Card-Inventory of Important Associated Finds in Archaeology; Great Britain 7th Set: GB. 42-47) contained a larger chisel of similar form and dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age. A similar chisel found at Monkton, Pembrokeshire (Savory 1980, pp. 117, No 265) was dated through associated artefacts to the 11th or 10th century BC.

Taunton / Cemmaes metalworking falls within Needham's (1996) Period 5, c. 1500 - 1150 BC. The palstave is complete and has an overall length of 163mm and weighs 494.8g. The butt is square and irregular with a width of 20.7mm and has a thickness of 4.0mm. The sides are slightly convex as far as the stop and are then straight and divergent before flaring to the expanded blade. The palstave is wider around the flanges (26.2mm), than on the blade near the stop (19.8mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished (by hammering and filing), with particular attention paid to the blade area and the unlooped side. The loop is wide at 11.5mm. The septum is rounded and concave with a straight stop, which meets the septum at a right angle. The flange facets meet the septum before the butt and are highest (37.3mm) at the stop. The stop has a height of 14.3mm above the septum and rises 9.4mm above the blade. The blade is decorated with a weak mid rib and side ribs. The ribs are defined by two small cast hollows (c. 20-28mm long and 3-4mm wide) flanking each rib. The blade has a maximum thickness below the stop of 23.7mm and gradually thins to 12.9mm at the prominent blade facet. Hammer dimples are evident on the blade facets of both faces. Some sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge are discernible. A single casting flaw on the septum of one face is visible. The palstave has good surface preservation and has a dark green to black patina.","In form this palstave appears similar to Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Group III, it should be noted that the breadth of the stop/flanges, and the height above the septum, is very significant. Typically, low-flanged palstaves have a stop/flange breadth of no more than approx. 31mm and a stop/flange height around 10mm. A breadth of 37.1mm is closer to the criteria as defined for south-western palstaves, though that type are also characterised by angular flanges that rise above the height of the stop (Smith 1959). Examples with high flanges that do not rise above the height of the stop are known from Somerset, such as one found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012).

132960,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"Copper alloy flat axehead dating to the Early Bronze Age.  It belongs to the phase I classification of types  (c. 2500 – 1450 B.C.) in Savoury’s Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections of the National Museum of Wales and appears to be of Migdale tradition.  It is not one of the earliest types of axe due to the flared blade and central thickening, which were improvements on the earliest types.

The convex blade is splayed on either side by roughly 10mm and the butt is slightly rounded.  Across the axehead run concentric ridges mimicking the shape of the blade.  The cutting edge remains quite sharp although the outer surface has flaked away in some places since discovery.

The longitudinal section is lozengic, created by a slight transverse median ridge and tapered ends.  This thickening at the centre was an attempt to prevent the blade from moving in the handle and ultimately damaging it.

The axehead is not symmetrical and may have been hammered at some time as there appear to be some marks on the pitted surface.  The patina remains across the majority of the object and is brown in colour, although there appears to be some surface decay.  Despite this, the axehead is in good condition.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-09-30T23:00:00Z,,,,109,,,9.8,97.4,1,Nina Steele,Nina Steele,Wales,Gwynedd,Gwynedd,Caernarfon,SH5064,From a paper map,53.151952,-4.244556,GAT-C63BD1,,PRN 24019-002.JPG,Flat axehead,Gwynedd Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/nsteele/PRN 24019-002.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/102553.jpg

The body flares evenly to the blade end of the object.  The blade flares out from the body with an even curviture to the edge.  The edge remains fairly sharp, though an imperfection in the metal has left a small semicircular divet in the center of the edge.  At the points of the blade, the width of the axe is 60mm.

The haft end is roughly squared, and it is difficult to tell whether this is the original butt or if butt broke off the object, the broken edges then smoothed slightly.  The butt measures 27mm in width.

The surface of the axe has an even grey-green patina, though where pitting occurs (always less than 1.5mm in diameter) the color is a light tinted green.  There are also patches of iron oxidation that seem to be integral to the object.

The oval profile of the socket narrows the further it extends into the main blade, becoming flat approximately 10mm short of the top.  The sides of the socket are slightly concave and lead into the main body of the spear.  The edges are very worn and appear not to reflect the objects original profile.  The blade edges flare downwards and outwards from the socket in a 'mushroom' shape.  The surface of the object is covered in a very thick layer of greyish mineralised deposit that also covers the inside of the socket as far as is visible.  There is a small area where the surface patina has come off on one side of the socket in between the line of the blade beginnings.  This area reveals two moulded decorative bands set horizontally around the socket.  

This object was discovered lying ontop of another object, recorded on the Portable Antiquities database as LIN-43C802.  This other object is also of uncertain date and function, however it does not display the same surface patina as the ?spear.

135647,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1000,"An incomplete cast copper alloy rapier, dating from the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age, between 1300 – 1000 BC (length: 120mm; width at shoulder: 45mm; thickness at mid blade: 5.5mm; weight: 76.6g).  The artefact can probably be classified as a Trump Group II: Thetford Class rapier (see Trump, B, A, V, 1962, ‘The Origin and development of British Middle Bronze Age Rapiers’ in ‘Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society’, pages 80 – 102.

Only part of the butt, shoulder and blade remain.  In plan, the artefact is an inverted and elongated sub-triangle with a convex side-section.  The sides curve inwards below the shoulder/ butt to form the incomplete tapering blade (width at broken end of blade: 19mm).  At the shoulder/ butt of the rapier, there are two probably deliberate notches instead of rivet holes in opposing corners to the left and right, with an approximate diameter of 11mm, and a slightly incomplete straight edge above and between the rivet holes, forming a trapezoidal appearance at the top of the artefact.  A worn but prominent midrib is evident on both sides of the rapier commences from the butt, with an additional rib to either side which follows the curve of the each shoulder.  All three ribs continue to the break half way down the blade.  The blade edge is slightly incomplete in all areas due to corrosion and old breaks.  Overall, the artefact is in a worn but fair condition with a slightly pitted surface and little of the original green/ brown patina remaining.

Similar examples are illustrated in Trump’s paper (see details above), particularly on page 85, figs 10 (found at the River Ouse, Thetford) & 11 (found at the River Shannon), which are both of the Group II Thetford Class.  On page 87, Trump states that the distinguishing feature of this class is that instead of rivet holes, the rapiers have punched (probably) penannular and deliberate notches at the corners of the butt, as well as the strongly moulded blade with an arris.  Although no moulds of this rapier have ever been found before 1962, they have a wide distribution with a prominent number found in the Fens (where they seem to have generated from in England) as well as others from around England, but a large number have been found in Ireland and Scotland.

The first part of the artefact is the incomplete butt and shoulder (length: 62.5mm; width: see above; thickness of shoulder: 5mm; weight: 40.6g).  The butt has a flat-sectioned rounded top with the remains of two incomplete rivet holes in opposing corners to the left and right, with an approximate diameter of 8mm (both rivets are missing).  The butt is also broken (an old break) and incomplete below the rivet holes, but the sides of the shoulder below curve inwards to form the start of a tapering blade.  This first part of the artefact, however, is broken (an old break) approximately 27mm below where the shoulder of the dirk begins to taper inwards.

The second part of the dirk (length: 61mm; width: 16.5mm; thickness at mid blade: see above; weight: 23.7g) immediately and precisely follows on from the break to the butt and shoulders with a fragment of the convex-sectioned mid blade, which still tapers inwards.  The blade edge to either side is worn and incomplete.

The third and final part of the artefact (length: 43mm; width: 12.5mm; thickness: 5.5mm; weight: 10.9g) continues approximately from where the mid blade fragment of the preceding part broke.  This third piece is also a fragment of the convex-sectioned blade, which is just slightly tapering, possibly indicating that this bottom fragment was broken or corroded just above the tip.

Down the central length of the top two sections, the dirk has a flat mid rib, which commences at the shoulder of the artefact and continues to follow the length of the blade approximately 4mm from the blade edge, which tapers downwards from this point.  Overall, the dirk is in a worn but fair condition with many areas of the original brown patina remaining, although there are also areas of corrosion, on one side of the artefact in particular.

A similar dirk is illustrated in Savory, H, N, 1980, ‘Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections’ in the National Museum of Wales, pages 113 & 176, fig 28, ref no 244, found at Newchurch, North Wales.

137216,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy barbed and tanged arrowhead, dating to the Bronze Age, between 2150 - 800 BC (length: 42mm; width at barbs: 28mm; thickness: 2mm; weight: 7.67g).


The haft end of a flat arrowhead with bevelled blade edges to the left and right on the outside of the barbs, which is also visible on both sides of the artefact.  The barbs are both broken but have a surviving length of 5mm (measured at the longest surviving barb), a width of 7mm with a thickness of 2mm.  The outside blade edges of the arrowhead slant inwards to taper towards the blade tip, which is no longer present as approximately 20mm of the artefact is now missing.  On one side of the arrowhead, the notches between the tang and the barbs are facetted with a recession of 6mm.  The slightly incomplete (due to corrosion) sub-rectangular and flat tang, which tapers to a thin rounded point at the tip is 19mm long, 9.5mm wide and 2mm thick, with the outside edges down the length of the tang also slightly bevelled.  The arrowhead is in a slightly worn but good condition with a light brown patina, although there are numerous tiny scratches on both sides, which appear to have been done recently, possibly due to cleaning.


An identical example has already been recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database by Dr Helen Geake (SF6680), and was found by metal detecting in Bradfield Combust with Stanningfield in Suffolk. Dr. Geake states that the Suffolk example also has the notches between the tang and the barbs on one side only, which suggests that that the artefact 'may be cast rather than created as a secondary process.  If this is the case, the object must have been manufactured as an arrowhead rather than being made as a secondary process from a fragment of another artefact; this makes it extremely rare'.  Dr. Geake also states that 'tanged (usually with barbs) copper-alloy arrowheads are known from the late bronze Age in Britain and western Europe, though they are rare'.  However, the Suffolk example, according to Dr. Geake, is more in common wit early Bronze Age forms and may be of this date, which at the time of writing the Suffolk record, would make it the only Early Bronze Age example known from Britain, therefore making this example also incredibly rare.

The flat axe is complete and has an overall length of 150.4mm and weighs 503.9g. The butt is square with a width of 24mm and is tapered to a thickness of 3mm. The sides are divergent and are straight for some 50mm before they become concave to the expanded blade. The sides are moderately flat across their thickness, but appear to have been hammered towards the centre. The axe is thickest near its centre at 11.5mm. The blade is wide at 88.69mm with only a slightly curved blade edge. The blade facet begins 10mm from the current (eroded) blade edge. Both faces are gently convex and no decoration is evident. One face has a prominent casting flaw, probably caused by an air bubble (8mm diameter, 3.4mm deep) within a hollowed area. The axe has a green brown patina with peripheral areas of surface loss (light to mid green colour). One face is currently suffering from active bronze corrosion.

The axe is incomplete, missing the blade, the mouth and loop, giving the axe a surviving length of 80.87mm and weight of 229.0g. The surviving mouth is uneven and irregular because of insufficient bronze to fill the mould during casting. The mouth has an oval profile with external dimensions of 46.95mm x 38.28mm (37.85 x 30.55mm internal). One face is higher at the mouth and appears to be turning out slightly, before it would have formed a slight mouth moulding. There is no evidence for whether the casting process employed a two-runner or four-runner technology. The collar is deep (26mm) and is concave on the more complete face. The remains of the loop begin beneath the mouth and are confined within the collar. The casting seams are prominent on both sides but have been finished. The sides are straight, but are beginning to flare outwards at the break. Beneath the collar, the axe has a sub-rectangular body profile.

The surface of the rear is coarse and unfinished. The rear is concave and displays a cast 'channel' for guiding a thin strap, the interior of the cannel is more even than the surrounding surface. The front of the fitting comprises two raised concentric circles and a central knop, divided by cast rounded channels. The head has a thickness of 3.9mm. The edge of the fitting is rounded and the central knop projects slightly above the raised circles, giving the fitting a maximum depth of 6.95mm.

The find was first identified as a palstave however the height of the flanges and their length combined with the lack of a stopridge make this unlikely. On the available evidence this is closer in form to a long flanged axehead see for example LVPL-558FA2 on the database. The long flanges will classify this either as a long flanged axehead or a developed flat axe. The flanges appear to be cast favouring the former type, although the diverging sides may indicate the latter. In either circumstance this form dates to the Early Bronze Age c. 1750-1500 cal BC (Following Roberts et al 2013).

Is an early palstave of ‘Group I: Primary Shield Pattern’ type, probably dated to the Middle Bronze Age.  All parts of the palstave are present and include a probable bar stop and a shield-shaped depression on the blade just below the stop.  The shield is transfixed by a long central ridge running from it to the cutting edge, this forms a primitive version of the ‘trident’ pattern.  The palstave also has roughly parallel sides above the stop and a widely splayed blade.  The cutting edge and blade tips are worn but intact.  The palstave has a mid to dark green patina but is slightly abraded with light green exposed areas.  There is also some slight gouging to the blade.  There is no casting seam.  It measures 138.9mm long and is 54.28mm wide (from tip to tip).  Palstaves of this type can be found in Schmidt, P. and Burgess, C. 1981.

143323,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"Bronze age palstave axe 163mm long, 53mm wide at the blade and 29mm thick at the flange. The axe is in fair condition, retaining about half of its original surface, and has a green patina. The axe weighs 415 grams and is complete. The septum is 65mm long and 7mm thick and is rectangular in form with slightly bulging sides, 23 to 29mm. The flange is 29mm at its widest and tapers sharply, ending 10mm short of the butt, which is flat. The stop sits about 5mm proud of the blade surface and tapers gently outwards to meet it. At this point the blade has two 'comma' shaped indentations, 20mm long and 12mm wide, which sit either side of a slight ridge which runs the length of the blade, together they form a heart shaped motif. The blade itself starts 27mm wide and thick and tapers gently to a point 53mm wide and 1mm thick. The blade has a stright edge and it tapers so gently in width that the blade facet is almost invisible. The side loop is 3mm in diameter and is 20mm wide and 8mm high.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-08-31T23:00:00Z,,,,,,,29,153,1,Wendy Scott,Wendy Scott,East Midlands,Rutland,Rutland,Leighfield,SK8104,From a paper map,52.627725,-0.804748,LEIC-15F0B5,,15F0B5a.JPG,Bronze age side looped palstave axe ,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wscott/15F0B5a.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/114587.jpg
143349,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2400,-2200,"Early Bronze Age (or Metal-Using Neolithic) copper flat axe, falling within Needham et al.'s (forthcoming) Class 2D, Type Halberton, or probably of Type Growtown / Milton Moss (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981).



The axe is near-complete with only a little damage to the edges and has a length of 98.55mm and weighs 325.1g. The butt has suffered a little damage making the type identification difficult and slightly speculative, but appears to have been straight with a surviving width of 32.9mm and a thickness of 4.5mm. The sides of the axe are comparatively straight and are very slightly concave. The sides are also straight across their thickness, giving the axe a rectangular profile. The axe has a maximum width at the blade of 66.21mm. The blade edge has a shallow curve and is unexpanded. Both faces of the axe are convex, producing a lenticular long profile, with a maximum thickness 38mm from the blade of 12.89mm. The surface of the axe has differential preservation, with a pale green to pale brown patina.","Non-destructive analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe was carried out by Mary Davis using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency and to make the analyses comparable with other results. Results obtained suggest the axe has a composition made up nearly entirely of copper and is broadly consistent with Northover's (1980, pp 230) metal type 'A'. Metallurgical sampling of the axe may provide greater accuracy on the metallurgical composition. Axes of this type can be attributed to Metalwork Assemblage II, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 1 of the British Bronze Age. The axe is likely to date to between c. 2,400 - 2,200BC",3,Copper,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,325.1,,,4.5,98.55,1,Sian Williams,Sian Williams,Wales,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Cwm Gwaun,SM9935,From a paper map,51.977015,-4.928003,NMGW-24F646,,200666.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200666.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629333.jpg

143610,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-1000,"Late Bronze Age socketed axehead of type Ulleskelf dating from 1150-1000BC. The axe has a square sectioned socket with a depth of 59.57mm. The mouth has three moulded transverse ribs; below these ribs there is a single side loop. The side loop is located 12.40mm from the mouth of the socket, the external width of the loop is: 17.17mm, internal width: 5.51mm. Just below the side loop, on the socket, there are two oval depressions, one on each side of the socket. These oval depressions extend partially around the front and reverse surfaces. After the depressions the blade starts and it is clearly defined by a step down from the socket. The blade has a crisp rectangular cross-section and it gently expands towards the curved cutting edge (width from: 28.35mm expanding to 37.17mm). There are visible hammer marks on the surface of the blade and the hammering has created a clear bevel at the cutting edge. There are some edge losses to the cutting edge and one corner is missing, however this may be post depositional damage. There are some casting flashes remaining around the mouth of the socket and along the sides. There are no internal ribs on the socket. The copper alloy has a dark brown patina.

143878,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A late Bronze Age copper alloy fragment of a Ewart Park-type, Class A sword (circa 1000-800 BC). The fragment comprises part of the grip, the shoulder and part of the blade. The final half of the blade and the end of the handle are broken and missing. The blade has a lozenge-shaped cross-section. There are two rivet holes, aligned parallel to the edge on the shoulder on each side (internal diameter: 5.34mm). On one side the rivet holes are complete, on the other side both are worn through. There are a further two rivet holes on the handle; they are aligned horizontally and both are worn through. These perforations have a waisted profile. The broken edges have the same mid green patina as the rest of the surface suggesting the damage occurred in antiquity. Similar hilt fragments were recorded in the Petters late Bronze Age metalwork assemblage (Needham 1990:52-53). Plate 4 (Needham 1990:52) shows two examples of Ewart Park swords with omega-shaped indentations similar to the 'worn through rivet holes' on this example.
