256239,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-2000,-1700,"Cast bronze (copper alloy) decorated developed flat axe of early Bronze Age date (2000-1700BC). The axe is relatively small but is complete with very little wear to the butt end. The blade is much worn and also much sharpened creating a distinct curved blade. The lower body / blade of the axe is decorated with punched pellets. This axe best fits into Developed Flat Axe typology, specifically Type: Bandon. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC.  The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed and worn crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is sub-rectangular with very slight raised edges / side flanges (H shaped). The overall length is 78.0mm and the axe weighs 43.71 grams. The butt is slight and narrow with a distinct D shaped rounded end. It is also relatively thin (1.0mm thickness, width 11.6mm). The long sides (edges) of the axe are relatively straight and expanding from the butt to the base of the blade. The edges of the axe have been raised slightly, probably by hammering rather than casting, to form very slight flanges. It should be noted that where there are raised flanges on both faces there is a distinct groove on the inner face of the axe again suggesting that they have been raised by hammering. At the mid point of the axe a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This is lightly to have been cast and augmented by hammering; small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces of the axe where the metal has been worked to augment them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, but acts as a distinct division between the butt and lower blade of the axe. The width of the axe at the median bevel is 17.9mm (thickness 5.7mm). Below the bevel the sides continue to expand.   The area between the median ridge and junction with the blade is decorated on both faces of the axe. The design on both is broadly identical being contained by the median bevel and another raised bevel at the top of the blade. This lower bevel echoes the shape of the blade being broadly crescentic and probably parallel to the original shape of the cutting edge. The decoration consists of a series of panels formed from lines of incised pellets. Both the median bevel and lower bevel each have two slightly crescent shaped parallel lines forming a distinct border across the axe, the two long sides each have a similar single line of pellets respecting their expanding edge. This forms a central sub rectangular area which is further sub-divided by two rectangles, aligned along the length of the axe, each made up with incised pellets. There is also some evidence of further decoration continuing on the septum / in the groove formed by raising the side facets. This consists of a single line of pellets on each long side terminating at approximately ½ the length of the butt. These pellets are indistinct and slightly obscured in places by abrasion. Beneath the decorated area and raised ridge the sides of the blade expand to produce an irregular, worn, crescentic blade edge with a maximum width of 29.5mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. However it is likely that the axe had been heavily worn and used prior to deposition, with the blade shape being distorted by repeated use. A distinct blade facet is not present.  The side of the axe are relatively uniform and there is no evidence of a cast seam. The upper edge of one side of the axe seems to have been decorated possibly with a cable like decoration, being formed from parallel diagonal facets. However, this is less clear on the other lower edge of the axe.    The axe is a mid green colour with a highly polished but abraded patina, which has been damaged in areas. Where this had occurred it is probably as a direct result of movement in the plough soil. This abrasion is most evident of the blade of the axe. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident.   The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to a number of decorated examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge ... Decoration, often rich and complex, is characteristic of Irish examples in particular (p65.) A good comparison to the style of decoration can be seen in axes 347 and 359, although direct parallel of decoration is not recorded",Found during the Weekend Wanderers Lattin Down Rally 6-7 September 2008,4,,,,Metal detector,,,,,43.7,,,5.7,78,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Wantage,SU4084,,51.55347551,-1.42447023,HESH-D95656,,HESH-D95656 detail 7.jpg,Early Bronze Age: decorated developed flat axe,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-D95656 detail 7.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/224569.jpg

The spearhead is complete, the blade and socket undamaged with a smooth green patina showing hardly any sign of decay. The head is leaf-shaped and the socket has a fairly pronounced midrib. The tip of the spearhead very thin being the same thickness as the socket at its widest point and there are very fine, very clear re-sharpening marks all around the edges of the wings, running parallel to it. The socket is has a wide diameter compared to the overall size of the spearhead and the loops, which are flattened, are situated roughly one third of the way along the shaft.



There is some hatched decoration along the sides of the socket where the casting seams had been smoothed down. Side-looped spearheads are categorised by Greenwell and Brewis' as Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal.

259951,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-800,-600,"This find is of a particularly good example of a late Bronze Age socketed axe in the tradition of the Llyn Fawr phase (800 - 600BC). The axe has a long, elegant form, with a single mouth moulding, now partly missing, and a well defined loop (external width - 20.69mm, internal - 6.18mm), formed just below the lip. There are no design mouldings to the faces of the axe but they are slightly convex in form. The mouth is near circular and the internal moulding replicates the exterior form, excluding the blade tips, to a depth of 85mm, with no mould lines. The sides of the axe have clear moulding seams that have been in part, hammer finished with the exception of the seam on the loop. The loop also has what might be a casting flash to its lower edge. The blade is slightly flanged with a cutting edge, measured from the intact half of 56mm and a width of 47mm. The flange would appear to be accomplished in the mould with no signs of further hammering to extend the tips. One tip is now missing and the cutting edge is largely corroded away. There is perhaps evidence of sharpening, as the blade tip has many fine transverse scratch marks across the width of the cutting edge. That the blade has been used is confirmed by a great many longitudinal/part diagonal scratches and gouges covering most of the blade surfaces. On one face, there is a large gouge near centre of the face and starting just under half way up and running to the mouth moulding. That gouge would appear to be consistent with use as it starts fine and narrow and expands in width and depth as it travels up the face. It is possible that it was responsible for the eventual damage to the mouth moulding. The surface shows sporadic outburst of corrosion but for the greater part, it has a fine polished dark brown patina.","The Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections (NMW) Fig 46-5 (P194) has a similar axe with a slight variation to the mouth moulding, from the Llynfawr Hoard.",4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2009-05-25T23:00:00Z,,,,173.8,,31.41,,120,1,Rod Trevaskus,Rod Trevaskus,Wales,Wrexham,Wrexham,Holt,SJ3752,GPS (from the finder),53.061515,-2.941524,CPAT-357295,,2873-0002.jpg,Bronze Age - Llyn Fawr - Socketed Axe,Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2873-0002.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/213967.jpg

271518,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-300,"Incomplete Middle Bronze Age to Early Iron Age bronze 'half-moustache'-like object with damage at both ends. It measures 36.24x9.87x9.84mm and weighs 10.74g. 

The object resembles half a moustache and consists of one solid pointed drop-shape. It is uncertain if it was originally a single half (as these are known) or one half of an original whole which would have been joined to the second half by a (probably perforated) central area.

At the wider end (9.87x9.84mm) the jagged (old) break stands 3.6mm proud of the solid object, suggesting the end would have been hollow, perhaps for attachment purposes. This half of the 'half moustache' is decorated with longitudinal pronounced ridges and deep grooves (twenty ridges) which encircle the outside edge whilst the object itself narrows and thins to 7.33x9.18mm. On the underside three ridges there are obscured slightly by a smoother patch of copper alloy, apparently over the top of the ridges. 

Beyond this the object tapers more dramatically to an (old) break 4.07x4.64mm. This half is plain, if badly pitted through loss of patina.

These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). Three other examples are known besides the twelve recorded on the PAS database. Some of these are single examples, while others are 'double' sometimes with a central perforation. This suggests the object was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.

273467,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,2200,1900,"This is a fragment of an Early Bronze Age flat axe.  In this case, the axe has lost most of the lower blade and cutting edge but the shape and overall characteristics, give credibility to the conclusion.











The butt is rounded, slightly bent and coincident with the bend, there is a stress fracture across the face around one centimetre from the top edge.  A small section of the butt has broken away and missing.  The surface is undecorated but there are what appear to be hammer strikes down the edges.  The axe width expands from the butt with a very slight concave curve towards the now missing blade section.  The remaining length is 81.5mm and maximum width 47.5mm.  The thickness runs from 6.92mm at the butt to 4.90mm at the remaining lower edge at the break.











Found in Shropshire near the border with Wales, it resembles the matrices carved on the five-matrix axe mould from the river bed of the Walleybourne below Longden Common which has been ascribed to the Migdale-Marnoch tradition. See Thomas, Nicolas, ""An Early Bronze Age Stone Axe-Mould from the Walleybourne below Longden Common, Shropshire"" in Prehistoric Man in Wales and the West, 1972, pp161-6. It is also similar to axeheads found at Usk, Monmouthsire and St George's, Glamorgan (Savory, H N, 1980. ""National Museum of Wales, Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections"", pp165, Fig. 17, nos 106 and 110).  Staff at the National Museum have now confirmed the this axe belongs to the Migdale Tradition.











The surface has a small area of ancient, brown bronze patina but the greater part is lost.  That patina has now broken away to reveal the corrosive bright green copper oxidation below.","METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF A FLAT AXE FRAGMENT FROM SHROPSHIRE


 ANALYSIS by Mary Davis[1]


TECHNIQUE


Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefact was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The axe was examined whole within the specimen chamber and was analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from under the surface corrosion were analysed; this occurred when the object was excavated. Apart from very superficial surface swabbing of the artefact there was usually no further sample preparation. The result presented is semi-quantitative. Overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion.


 


Three separate readings were taken from the axe and the overall totals acquired were relatively low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analysis comparable with other results.


 


RESULT


Bronze


Average composition of metal


84-88% copper


1-2% arsenic


11-13% tin


 


COMMENT by Adam Gwilt[2]


This is the butt end of an early axe with a narrow butt and concave flaring sides. The identification of this as being bronze in composition, rather than copper, helps to identify this axe as of Type Migdale, belonging to the early part of the Early Bronze Age and dating to between 2200-1900BC. However, the relatively thick butt is atypical for the type, generally defined as having a tapering butt. This fragment probably belonged to a large and heavy flaring axe, showing close affinity with many similar axes known from Scotland. It is likely to be British rather than an Irish product. In Wales, two hoards containing Migdale axes are known, from Brithdir, Caerphilly and Oxwich, Swansea, while a mould for a Migdale axe has been found at Betws-y-Coed, Conwy. Only around 30 examples of Migdale axes are currently known from Wales, while Dr Peter Northover only lists an additional six examples from the Welsh Marches in his recent study of bronzes from Wales and The Marches. This artefact, though fragmentary, therefore has some importance for the wider understanding of the early use and deposition of bronze in the region. It merits careful recording, illustration and photography to ensure it may be included within a wider future synthesis of material from the early part of the Early Bronze Age.

273872,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-700,"Late Bronze Age (1000 – 700 BC) cast bronze faceted Socketed Axehead of type Gillespie, sometimes known as ‘baggy axe’. It measures 83.62mm in length and weighs 213.39g.

The axe has a faceted, short, broad and baggy body with a gentle curve at the sides extending into a flared trumpet shaped mouth at one end and expanded cutting edge at the other. Both cutting edge and mouth are of similar width, making the axehead rather symmetrical.

The mouth is circular in shape and measures c.43mm in diameter. It has a deep flaring collar which has a moulded rim at the edge. The socket is rather more oval in shape, measuring 32.8x29.61mm. It is 67mm deep.

The loop projects just beneath the flaring collar, where the body measures 37x34mm. From here, the sides drop with a very gentle curve to the expanded cutting edge, 48.97mm wide. The facets extend inwards of the edge in a deep curve, which straightens to a vertical roughly half way along the body of the axe.

The surface is extremely pitted though the patina is preserved in some areas, notably the cutting edge which has obviously had additional work in its lifetime. The casting flashes around the loop have been smoothed but area still visible, unlike the join on the other side where they are not visible. There also appear to be casting flashes around the mouth moulding (possibly an additional, thinner moulding below that of the open end) but this seems unfinished, or else obscured by pitting.

The inside of the socket shows two prominent ribs from the corresponding grooves of the core.

This axe is of a type which is known as Type Gillespie, which Burgess and Schmidt suggest is associated with later Wilburton metalworking traditions and Ewart Park tradition. It has been suggested that this form of facet axe continues production into the Llyn Fawr tradition (which is the transitional period between the metalwork of the Bronze and Iron Ages).

Length 108.7mm, Width 27.8mm, Thickness 23.9mm, Weight 168g. This palstave has the stop-ridge fused to small flanges to form a pocket on each face of the tool which split or folked ends of the wooden handle could be attached. There was a single loop now missing added onto the lower surface of the axe to enable it to be fastened more securely to the haft. This has broken away in antiquity. Possibly resulting in the loss of the axe. This palstave has a plain blade of narrow shape with a fine casting seam. Approximately 70% of the axe has an olive green patina but there is surface corrosion on the rest with loss of the end of the butt and possibly some of the cutting edge of the blade. Ref.

279925,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-800,"A cast bronze faceted socketed axehead. The mouth of the socket, in the interior, is almost circular in plan and measures 29.8mm diameter. The exterior has a single prominent moulded ridge around the mouth rim. Below the rim there is a more feint ridge which is sited just above the side loop. On one side there is an integral loop which is semi-circular in plan and a sub-lozenge in section. Extending from the more feint moulded ridge there are multiple ribs on both faces, five on one face and seven on the other. In plan the axe has slightly concave sides with a slight flaring at the blade. The blade is heavily abraded and the original edge is now lost. The sides of the axe form a shallow ‘<’ shape in section with a casting seam at the apex. The side casting seams have been smoothed slightly, but are still visible. When these seams extend to the mouth rim, the seams have been smoothed to become almost flat. Approximately half of the socket is filled with what appears to be soil rather than organic remains. The socket has been recently cleaned. The surface of the axe has a shiny mid blue/green patina covering the majority of the axe, otherwise there are areas of abrasion and corrosion. There are slight traces of a shiny grey surface on the axe as well. The axe measures 114.04mm in length, 45.22mm wide across the apex of the loop and upper portion of the axe, and is 40.74mm thick across the mouth rim.

280188,Winged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-875,-800,"Late Bronze Age bronze end-winged axe, belonging to the Carp's Tongue complex of Ewart Park metalworking, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7 and dated to c. 950-750BC.



The winged axe is incomplete, missing both wings on the unlooped side (the axe has an overall length of 1360.9mm and a weight of 282.8g). The butt protrudes beyond the return of the wings (by 14mm) and expands to the end (with a width of 22.4mm and a thickness of 6.1mm). The end of the butt has two 'horns' each side of a central rectangular break, which would have been attached to the casting jet before removal. The sides of the axe are straight and converge slightly towards the start of the blade (where the axe has a maximum body width behind the loop of 27mm and a minimum width at the stop of 21.8mm). The loop is positioned towards the rear of the wings (and has a length of 20.7mm, a height of 8.7mm, giving the axe an overall width of 34.6mm, a thickness of 6mm and an aperture of 7.4mm x 5.3mm). The remains of the casting seams are discernible along both sides. The wings diverge sharply to their apices before returning more gradually to the blade. The wings are only partially turned-over and were unlikely to have been closed (the wings have a maximum height of 36.4mm, a length of 48.7mm and a thickness of 4.7mm). Both the wings on the unlooped side have broken in antiquity (with a surviving height of 23mm) a stress fracture near the blade appears to suggest the wing was struck from the top (as hafted). The stop is rounded and gradually slopes from the septum (where the axe has a maximum body thickness of 18.0mm). The blade is slender and the sides diverge to form a rounded blade edge (with a width of 40.3mm). The blade faces are slightly convex with no discernible blade facet. The original surface of the axe has been lost and has a current pitted bronze surface. The septum has small patches of black patina surviving.



End-winged axes are associated with the Carp's Tongue complex with a distribution centred around northern France and southern Britain. Burgess's (1968) distribution of the axe type is confined to south-eastern England except for one western outlier in St. Kenidjack, Cornwall. Swansea Museum has a (probable) replica end-winged axe recovered from Sketty, Swansea. A Ewart Park hoard recovered in 2005 from Llancarfan, Vale of Glamorgan contained one end-winged axe (Gwilt, 2008, p 221, no. 1223) . This discovery appears to represent the third find of this axe type in Wales and the fourth in western Britain and may suggest a possible local clustering around Swansea, possibly indicating a network of exchange and circulation of metalwork around coastal South Wales.",,3,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,282.8,,,23,1360.9,1,Steve Sell,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Swansea,Swansea,Sketty,SS6390,From finder,51.592143,-3.979119,NMGW-E7E1C2,,wing axe.jpg,Winged axe drawing,,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/wing axe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/231977.jpg

1. South Wales-type socketed axe 



Length 102.0mm, blade width 54.0mm, weight 354.0g. 



This is a complete bronze axe with an outsplayed mouth moulding and a high loop. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped mouth in plan, with four runner stubs, indicating a four runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent and concave sides, expanding slightly near the blade edge. Three near parallel longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding down both faces of the axe. Prominent casting flashes down the sides and around the loop indicate minimal preparation after casting. The blade edge is damaged but curved, with striations along the blade bevel, indicating some preparation of the blade for use. Much of the internal and external surfaces are covered with a black patination, worn surfaces and the blade edges having a grey-green patination.



2. South Wales-type socketed axe



Length 84.0mm, blade width 44.9mm, weight 211.4g.



This is a complete bronze axe with an outsplayed mouth moulding and a high loop. The axe has a sub-oval shaped mouth in plan, with four runner stubs, indicating a four runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent and concave shaped sides, expanding slightly near the blade edge. Three convergent longitudinal ribs descend from the mnouth moulding down both faces of the axe. Casting flashes survive down the sides and around the loop, indicating minimal preparation after casting. The blade edge is damaged but curved, with striations along the blade bevel, indicating some preparation of the blade for use. Some of the upper and internal surfaces are covered with a black patination, worn surfaces and the blade edges having a grey-green patination.","This small hoard was buried during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age and dates to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). South Wales -type axes were commonly made and used in south east Wales at this time (McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980; Needham 1981). Over 30 hoards containing at least 140 examples are known from this region (e.g. Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), making it the core areas within Britain for their burial within hoards. However, they were also made and used across south western and central southern England, with a few examples circulating as far as northern Britain, Ireland and northern France. The discovery of another similarly dated in the vicinity of this find-spot is interesting. This was found in 2005, some 358 metres to the north-west (Treasure Case 05.15 Wales). It contained nineteen artefacts, including sword fragments, an end-winged axe, South Wales-type socketed axes, a faceted axe, a casting jet and ingot fragments and is now displayed at the National Museum Cardiff (Museum Accession Number 2007.18H).

283890,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"
A small and creased fragment of gold foil. The foil is folded over in half and has jagged tear edges on three sides.
","The gold foil was found sitting immediately on a Bronze Age stone working surface, approximately 5.5 by 4.0 metres in area. Associated within the same soil context as the gold foil (2) were 31 sherds of Middle Bronze Age tradition pottery (1500-1100BC), a rolled-top bronze pin of Middle or Late Bronze Age (1500-800BC) date and an animal bone assemblage. It is possible that the small fragment of gold foil (2) may once have coated a penannular ring (hair-ring). These are a reasonably common class of Bronze Age artefacts, using gold foil for surface decoration. Loose and non-adhered foil is sometimes observed projecting from their terminals. While a number of dated examples belong to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800BC), it is now thought that they started to be manufactured towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC) (e.g. TAR 2004, no. 17; Raftery 2004). In the light of the associated pottery, a Middle to Late Bronze Age date (1300-1000BC) has been suggested for this foil.",3,Gold,Silver,,Controlled archaeological investigation,2008-07-02T23:00:00Z,,2008W8,,,,,,4.4,1,Adam Gwilt,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llan-Maes,SS9869,Generated from computer mapping software,51.410817,-3.467992,NMGW-093625,,DH003186_05.jpg,Middle - Late Bronze Age gold foil,National Museums and Galleries of Wales,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH003186_05.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/235390.jpg
283900,Armlet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A plain and elongate gold strip with near parallel sides. One terminal survives, while the other has been torn around 4-7mm from the end. The surviving terminal is loosely folded over, with an external width of 3.5-5mm. The terminal tapers gradually beyond the fold-over, with a flat but slightly convex shaped end and rounded corners. An offset crease, parallel to the terminal-end is visible 2.2-2.5mm from the edge, the strip terminal also being pinched and thinned beyond the crease. Approximately 4mm from the terminal, a pin-hole approximately 0.8mm in diameter perforates the strip. Denting on the underside or interior of the fold-over indicates the pin was pressed from the current exterior side, though small projecting margin rings of excess gold are visible on both margin surfaces. A scrape next to the perforation was probably made in error with the same fine pin at the time the perforations were made.



The opposite terminal looks to be starting to taper, near the point of the tear. One torn corner has folded over since breakage. This terminal has two perforations, each approximately 0.8mm in diameter. One perforation is approximately 2.2mm from the torn end, while the tear has bisected the second perforation. Denting on one surface indicates the pin was pressed from the same side as the perforation on the other terminal, and projecting margin rings of excess gold are visible on both surface margins. The end 12mm of the strip exhibits prominent sinuous bending at right angles to the long-axis of the strip. At one time, this was probably bent over, similarly to the other terminal.



At the mid-point along the strip is a band, indicating a point at which the strip was once folded around a larger object, itself around 20-25mm wide. This folding point is evidenced on the interior side by a localised change in the surface gold texture and delimited by linear changes of surface contour around 3.5mm apart. On the exterior surface, there is slight evidence for lines of bending of the gold in the same place. The strip edge on one side also looks to be distorted at this point.



The strip looks to have been hammer-shaped, with small surface facets, pressed ridged folds and slight localised variations in the strip-width. Slight surface scratching probably occurred during burial and retrieval.","Average composition of edge: 93.5% gold, 6% silver, 0.5% copper

283957,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe fragment.



This is a small blade end fragment of a bronze socketed axe, representing perhaps 20% of the original axe. The sides of the axe flare at the blade end and the blade edge is curved. The base of the socket is clearly present. Too little of the axe survives to identify whether it was ribbed or plain and to type. The blade surfaces are worn and weathered, the break edges also being abraded. The axe has a dark brown patination.","Too little of this socketed axe fragment survives to identify it to precise type, however as a socketed axe, it may be confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, between 1150-750BC (e.g. Savory 1980; Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Needham 1990; Needham et al 1997; Eogan 2000). The previously reported artefacts in the hoard, a ribbed socketed axe and a casting jet (produced when making a South Wales type socketed axe), were dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (950-750BC). Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that the blade fragment is contemporary with another two associated artefacts (Treasure case 03.17). The close vicinity of the finds with each other, at similar depth, and their common fragmented and weathered state, add weight to the likelihood that they were once buried together as a closed hoard group, being slightly disturbed by ploughing or forestry during the more recent past. Together, the composition and fragmentation of this hoard group would be entirely consistent with other hoards deposited in south east Wales at this time (Savory 1980; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004; Gwilt & Lodwick in prep).",3,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2008-07-14T23:00:00Z,,,,34.6,,,,26.3,1,Adam Gwilt,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llanhennock,ST3795,,51.650247,-2.911991,NMGW-0B0327,,DH003183_02.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed axe blade,National Museums and Galleries of Wales,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH003183_02.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/235377.jpg

The sword fragment is represented by the base of the hilt and the very top of the blade (with a surviving length of 54.4mm and a weight of 77.5g).

289717,Dress Fastener (unknown),Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"Copper alloy ring of uncertain date, possibly a Late Bronze Age dress-fastener The ring is near-complete, with minimal peripheral damage to one of the terminals (with an overall height of 47.8mm and a weight of 99.1g). The terminals are joined but there is a fracture between the two sides (giving the object an overall width of 76.9mm). The terminals are circular but are irregular (with a diameter of 40mm) and are angled upwards towards the midpoint. The underside of the terminals have a crescent-shaped bevel on the outer edges, elsewhere the underside is concave and appears unfinished from casting. At the centre of each terminal are raised stubs around a rectangular depression (5.3mm long by 1.3mm wide), presumably the remnants of where the jet was removed, although it remains uncertain why the casting left rectangular depressions. The upper faces of the terminals have a raised edge defined by an internal groove. The finished edge does not continue onto the inner side of the terminals. The faces are convex, growing deeper towards the hoop (with a thickness of 6mm). There is a semicircular moulding around the hoop on both terminals (19mm long, 15mm wide and 1mm deep). The hoop (with a maximum external width of 60.2mm and internal: 44.1mm wide by 29.7mm high) is of oval section and is widest and deeper near the terminals (at 14mm wide and 9mm deep) and narrows to the midpoint of the hoop (7mm wide and 7mm deep). There are no discernible wear facets around the hoop. The inner face of the hoop has a casting flaw near one terminal, resulting from an air bubble. The surface of the copper alloy is pitted with a mid-brown patina and a silvery sheen, probably because of tin leaching, leading to surface enrichment.","Analysis to ascertain the metallurgical composition of the bronze was attempted using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were taken from the surface and initial results appear to have been effected by the tin leaching referred to above, resulting in very high tin readings. Unusually, there was no lead detected in the readings. The ring appears to be unfinished on the terminals and any identification is somewhat speculative. The form of the artefact closely resembles 'dress-fasteners', particularly if the terminals were finished and separated to form a penannular ring. Dress-fasteners are of Late Bronze Age date, generally associated with the Ewart Park and Llyn Fawr metalworking industry, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Periods 7 and 8, dated to c. 950-750BC and 750-450BC respectively. Dress-fasteners are of uncertain function, and are generally made of gold and recovered from Ireland and Scotland, with outliers from Yorkshire and Norfolk (Eogan 1994, p 98, fig 40) . Bronze examples are occasionally recovered, such as in the Mountrivers Hoard, County Cork, Ireland (Eogan, 1994, Plate XVI) and the Poolewe Hoard, Ross and Cromarty, Scotland (Schmidt & Burgess, plate 152) .

The socketed axe is fragmentary, represented by only a blade side fragment (with a surviving length of 41.3mm, a surviving width of 26.2mm and a weight of 42.7g). The base of the socket is present at the top of the fragment (where the axe has a surviving thickness of 13.4mm, the axe faces have a thickness of 5mm and the socket has a maximum width of 3.8mm and a surviving depth of 9.6mm). The axe side appears to flare outwards towards the mouth, although corrosion may have eroded the shape. The surviving side was likely to have been convex across its width or have had a hexagonal body profile. The faces of the fragment are straight and converge to the blade. The blade edge has been lost. The axe has a significant crack across one face and the side, which is likely to have occurred in antiquity. The broken side of the axe is patinated, suggesting that the axe was broken in antiquity. Areas of brown surface patina survive, elsewhere the fragment is pale green with a powdery surface.

The axe is incomplete missing the butt (with a surviving length of 59.2mm and a weight of 64.7g). The axe is of sub rectangular section and is comparatively slender and stout (with a width at the break of 18.0mm and a thickness of 8.8mm). The axe fragment reaches its thickest point (at 9.4mm), 36mm from the blade edge. The sides of the axe are straight and near parallel for the length of the blade. The casting seams are not discernible on the sides of the axes. The blade faces are plain and slightly convex, both across their lengths and widths. There are no flanges on the surviving blade faces. The blade width expands sharply at the position where the blade facet begins (13mm from the blade edge). The blade edge is now comparatively straight, turning at the edges and has lost the blade tips (with a surviving blade width of 28.1mm). The blade edge appears to have been blunted through impact. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge but these have been obscured by a varnish coating of the axe. One face of the axe has probable stress fractures near the break and also has two impact marks (both 6.6mm long and 1.5mm wide), presumably from a bladed tool, perhaps another axe. The other face has a casting flaw near the break. The axe has a pale to dark green surface patina and has a recent gloss coating.



The missing butt makes identification and typological dating difficult. It is unclear to what degree of finishing the axe has undergone and whether the blade and flanges were yet to be worked. The 'blocky' nature of the axe would appear to either suggest a Developed flat axe of Metalworking Assemblage IV - V or a Later Short-flanged type of Taunton - Penard metalworking. Its form can be paralleled with some Class 4 developed flat axes (following Needham forthcoming) which can be dated to Needham's (1996) Period 3 dated to c. 1950-1700BC. Alternatively, Later Short-flanged axes fall within Period 5, dated to c.1500-1150BC. The apparent non introduction of lead into the bronze alloy may suggest an earlier technology and lend weight to an identification of a developed flat axe.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,64.7,,,,59.2,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9878,,51.491714,-3.470589,NMGW-A4E598,,2009.59.jpg,Early - Middle Bronze Age axe,PAS,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.59.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/275527.jpg
291709,Barbed And Tanged Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1500,"An apparently complete cast copper alloy barbed and tanged arrowhead, of Early Bronze Age date (2150 - 1500 BC).






The arrow has a deep brown patina typical of bronze artefacts of this date.  It was manufactured using a relatively simple casting technique. It is very worn and chipped around the edges. However, a raised midrib and bevelled edges are apparent. The body of the blades are slightly concave. The tang is sub-rectangular , tapering slightly towards the end, which could be a break rather than a deliberate end. It has relatively crude notches between the tang and barbs. The chipping and wearing on the edges and body indicate use wear rather than post-depositional damage, and so suggest a long period of use for this object. The style of the arrowhead copies flint barbed and tanged arrowheads of the period. Copper alloy arrowheads of this style and dates are rare in Britain. Other examples recorded on the PAS database can be found at SF-4014B0, WMID-CE6A76 and SF6680. All other examples are stray detector finds and consequently the accurate dating of the objects is problematic. However, Dr. Colin Pendleton (SCCAS) notes that there is no reason to doubt that these are contemporary with Early Bronze Age flint examples of similar form.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.72,,,2,43,1,Julie Cassidy,Julie Cassidy,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,,,,,,,NARC-F9B223,,sargent arrowhead.jpg,arrowhead,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/jcassidy/sargent arrowhead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/276364.jpg

383228,Axehead,Bronze Age,,,-1700,-1500,"A copper-alloy cast axehead  dating from the end of the early Bronze Age, from circa 1700 - 1500  BC. The axe suffers from wear and corrosion, but appears to be a  developed  flat axe, possibly of Type Bandon (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 31).  The poor level of preservation makes it difficult to ascertain whether  there was originally any decoration on the axe, so close identification  of the type is tentative.


The axe has low ridges running  along each lateral edge, becoming less pronounced towards the blade  and the butt. A low bevel is situated between these ridges, running  from the butt for 43.6 until a very low stop ridge runs across the face.   This stop ridge is not in the same place on both sides of the axe head,  occurring at 57.7 mm from the butt on one side. The axe has a crescent  shaped blade, 49.12 mm in width. The axe gradually flares in width from  20.2 mm at the base to 31.2 just before the blade. It is lozenge shaped  in profile and measures 103.36 mm in length. It is 3.7 mm thick at the  butt, 12.8 mm thick in its centre and 0.8 mm thick at the tip of the  blade.  It weighs 151.5 grams.

The socket measures 12.45 mm long and 15.23 mm wide at the broken attachment end and approximately 10.7 mm in diameter at the broken tip end. Either side of the socket is a chamfered wing, emerging just after the break at the shaft end. The spearhead measures 41.55 mm long and is 27.41 mm at its widest point. It is 13.05 mm thick and weighs 18.0 grams. The surface has a dark green to black patina, heavily pitted in places.

387225,Pin,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete late Bronze Age copper alloy pin dating c. 1000-800BC. The pin has a globular head with radiating vertical incised lines. The shaft of the pin has a circular cross-section and only slightly tapers to one end. This end is rough and has the appearance of a break. Midway down the shaft is a collar with a perforation through it. The upper section of the pin, between the globular head and perforated collar, is completely covered in engraved decoration. The pattern comprises a band of rings around the shaft then a section of rows of diagonal lines extending along the length of the pin; then a section of four repeating patterns of herringbone motifs with a linear border. This complete pattern is repeated along the length of the pin stopping below the perforated collar, leaving the final remaining third of the pin undecorated. There appears to be some evidence of wear around the perforation on the collar. The collar is also decorated with the same technique as the rest of the pin; the pattern here comprises a double saltire cross on each site of the collar. The copper alloy has a dark green patina.

On each 'wing', there are incised grooves running lengthwise for a little under half the total length. The ends are plain and taper to slender blunt points, one of which has lost its tip. A comparable scabbard chape can be found illustrated in Smith (1925, 75; fig. 67).","These objects, of which only a few are known from Britain, are all distinctly moustache shaped, but some are of more 'droopy' appearance than others.

Dr Kevin Leahy comments:


This is a most unusual socketed axe as it is the first one that I have seen that shows any sign of being truncated by wear/shapening. Most socketed axes retain their proportions.

391756,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave, of Group II: Early Midribbed type, possibly of Type Liswerry (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 125-128)[1].



The palstave is unlooped and is complete (with a length of 148.3mm and a weight of 346.2g). The butt is rounded at the corners and the sides diverge slightly (with a width at the butt of 17mm) to the start of the flanges. The flanges begin 23mm from the butt and rise to a maximum height (of 30.3mm) before the stop. The sides are straight and parallel (with a width of 25.1mm) until the blade, where the sides are concave and divergent. The casting seams are evident on both sides and appear to be raised on the sides of the blade. The blade tips are slightly eroded (producing a blade width of 54.6mm) and the blade edge has an expanded blade edge. The septum is gently concave (with a maximum depth of 12mm, a width of 17mm and a length of 64mm). The stops are slightly rounded and there is a casting flaw between the stop and septum on one face. The stops are raised above the blade faces (with a height of 8mm and an overall depth of 29.2mm). The blade faces are decorated with a prominent and comparatively short mid-rib (33m long). The blade faces are slightly raised at the sides, suggesting short side ribs. A blade facet is discernible (13m from the blade edge). Remnant traces of the original surface survive, mostly on the septum and within the flanges with a dark green to black patina; elsewhere the surface is pitted and is pale green.



The palstave has a narrow body similar to Type Liswerry, although the flange extensions are comparatively short, similar to Type Chepstow. The dating of Group II palstaves corresponds to the ActonPark metalworking industry, equating to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1,500 - 1,150BC.

391840,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1200,-800,"Cast copper alloy socketed axehead. The mouth of the socket is sub-rectangular in shape this has a moulded collar running around its circumference on the outside with the side loop beginning just below the moulding. Running down either side is casting flash. The main shaft of the axe is rectangular in cross section, with three pronounced moulded ridges that run down from the socket and converge just above the blade to form a V-shape. The blade is crescent shaped.











The casting of this axe is extremely poor, this combined with poor quality metal has resulted in heavy pitting over the whole artefact. This pitting would have occurred during the manufacturing process and would most likely be the result of bubbles forming in the mould during casting.  Considering the poor quality of the metal and it's weaken state due to poor casting, it is unlikely this axe was used as a tool, but instead may have been used ritualistically.

399510,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-600,"A cast copper alloy socketed axehead that in style, is consistent with the Sompting type with a prominent bulbous biconical collar with a horizontal moulding beneath. Sompting axes are typical of the Llyn Fawr phase, technically seen as the Bronze-Iron Age transition and sometimes now called the Earliest Iron Age (800-600BC). 

The axehead has a sub square section mouth. The fixing loop is then drawn from the lower moulding to extend 24mm down the side moulding with an inner diameter of 8mm.











The axe is undecorated with flat plain sides, no edge chamfer and broadly splayed to the cutting edge; the seam sides are wedge shape in plan and slightly convex with clear casting lines. Although there are numerous marks/gouges to the surface of the axe, they look to be due to the passage of time in the ground. There are no clear signs of use.











Coming to the damage to the axe; there is significant and extensive damage that appears to be contemporary with the date of the axe. One side of the blade has been struck very hard with a heavy round object such to cause the axe to bend and split on the opposing face. The edge of the blade has then also been struck several times with a similar heavy round object, leading to an almost denticulate edge with four clear strikes. The damage must have been deliberate and had rendered the axe useless.











The reason for the damage may only be speculated at; it may have been an unsatisfactory casting or perhaps prepared for votive use or simply come to the end of its useful life. The surface has a bright mottled green patina with some original smooth brownish surface patina still in evidence.","Plain examples in Schmidt & Burgess (1981) The Axes of Scotland and Northern England.

Discussion

The Type Meldreth and Yorkshire socketed axes, the bar toggle, the probable phalara fragments and the nail headed pin all date this hoard to the Ewart Park metalwork phase (c. 1000-800 BC) in the Late Bronze Age. Type Yorkshire socketed axes are frequently found in hoards from East Anglia to Scotland (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 223) and Type Meldreth socketed axes are well known throughout Britain, Ireland and Western Europe (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204). Nail headed pins are rarer but are found throughout England, including the northeast with comparable pins found in Heathery Burn Cave, County Durham (Britton and Longworth 1968, nos. 95-108; O'Connor 1980, 200, list 180, map 63). Bar toggles are occasionally found in hoards in England (see Rafferty 1975; O'Connor 1980, 196 and List 169) and although the Stannington example lacks the distinguishing central loop or perforation, it is possible that this is due to the breakage on the rectangular protrusion.

The probable cauldron handle fragment is comparable in shape and dimensions to the two cauldron handles placed in a hoard with a two blade fragments and 11 socketed axes, including one of Type Yorkshire, at Kilkerran, Ayrshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, plate 147 and p. 225-226, no. 1383; for further discussion of Late Bronze Age cauldrons, buckets and their handles see Gerloff 2010). The probable phalara fragments are interpreted, as are the bar toggles, as horse gear and are found throughout England and beyond (O'Connor 1975; 1980, 197, list 171.) with two from the northeast at Heathery Burn cave and Eastgate, Co. Durham (O'Connor 1975, 220). The final object, a probable wagon fitting, has no straightforward parallel in Britain or beyond but is broadly comparable to sections of Late Bronze Age tubular wagon fittings found in the Hart a. d. Alz group in Central Europe (see Pare 1992, 18-42). Despite the relative rarity of certain object types in the hoard, the assemblage is comparable to parts of the Heathery Burn Cave, County Durham hoard(s) (Britton and Longworth 1968) and Kilkerran, Ayrshire hoard (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 225-226) amongst others.

Conclusion

The hoard fulfils the requirements for being considered Treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act (2002 Amendment).

The copper alloy axe moulds are for the manufacture of Type Welby socketed axes as defined by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, 221-3) and date to the EwartPark period (1020-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age (Needham et al. 1997). Their discovery location in Leicestershire is approximately ten miles west of the Welby hoard find site described by Smith (1957, 24, fig.4). Such axe moulds are rare but this can be compared to the mould from Roseberry Topping, Yorkshire (Type Sompting) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 243),It is possible that the copper alloy socketed axe of the Welby Type as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, 205) may have been made in this mould though until further cleaning there is no way of evaluating this any further.

The point end of the blade is rounded and the opposite edge broken off so that the rest of the blade and hilt, which would have all been cast as one piece, are missing. The sides of the blade come to a point and are slightly bevelled. The pronounced central ridge running up and down the length of the blade, rounded but not flattened in section, resembles the daggers and swords from the Penard (c.1250-1125 BC) and Wilburton (c.1125-975 BC) phases of the Bronze Age. But the mid-rib is only on one side of the blade which suggests that this is a fragment from a dagger blade, and more likely to date from the Penard phase, when daggers have been found associated with Ballintober swords.

406303,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An almost intact cast bronze / copper alloy socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 800 BC).


The axe is almost complete (95%), with only a few chips missing from the edge of the blade. The original edge of the blade is not present so it is hard to determine how the blade extended outwards.


The axe is sub rectangular in plan, with the edge of the cutting edge appears to expand / flare outwards to form an convex cutting edge. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is relatively poorly preserved. The socket is sub square in cross section, with a circular opening (internal diameter 31.23mm, external width 42.78mm). The socket has been emptied out of the soil to reveal a square shaped void extending the majority of the length of the axe. The external edge of the socket is flaring out to form a ridge around the mouth of the socket. The edges of the blade are faceted, with elegant proportioned edges that expand from the expanded blade to the socket. The lower edge exhibits a semi circular moulded side loop (25.65mm length, 11.55mm wide, 4.60mm thick and projects 9.65mm away from the surface of the axe), in parallel alignment to the blade. On both sides of the blade, there are a large number of fine diagonal and horizontal striations, indicating the final finishing and preparing of the blade. A casting seam (central raised ridge) runs the length of the axe from the socket mouth to the side of the blade. The opposing edge to the loop exhibits another casting seam (central raised ridge) running the length of the blade. These casting seams are the result of the mould being used to cast the axe being made originally in two halves. The two sides of the mould are slightly misaligned, indicating that the mould has slipped slightly during the casting process. The casting seams have been hammered, filed and smoothed. Four casting jets are present along the edge of the socket, and have been filed and smoothed off. These two sides are both sub triangular in plan with the apex of the triangular being the point of the blade.


The other two sides are sub rectangular in plan, with three parallel vertical ribs present approximately a third of the way along the axe from the socket, extending from a horizontal rib, parallel to the socket. These ribs are about 4.7mm wide and extend approximately 26.7 mm down the length of the axe. They start 18.75 mm away from the mouth of the socket. A low ridge runs around the axe at the top of these ribs.


The axe measures 105.66mm in length, 42.94mm wide, 45.65mm high at the socket and 46.42mm at the edge of the blade. The metal is 7.40mm thick. It weighs 332 grams.


The axe has a even dark green smooth patina covering it. Around the top of the axe, the surface is a dark almost black colour, which is normally typical of South Wales type axes, however this Axe is more typical of the Bredon Hill type (North Wales type). There are a couple of areas of active corrosion (bright green powdery areas), mainly located on the edge of the blade and in a couple of small sections on the socket. Within the socket, some of the soil has been impregnated with copper corrosion products. These areas need careful observation to ensure that active corrosion does not cause any more problems. Advice from a trained conservator should be sought.


This axe fits within the socketed and faceted axe typology; specifically into the division type Meldreth which is broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age. It is associated with the later phases of the Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and earlier phases of the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-800 CAL. BC. Broadly these forms of faceted axes have a distribution on the Eastern side of Britain and suggest a southern British metalworking tradition (cf Schmidt & Burgess).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-07-30T23:00:00Z,,,,332,45.65,,7.4,105.66,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,East Staffordshire,Wootton,SK1145,From finder,53.002208,-1.837536,WAW-F69CD5,,WAW-F69CD5_9.jpg,Late Bronze Age: Socketed Axe,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WAW-F69CD5_9.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/297501.jpg

407843,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A cast copper-alloy axehead of late Bronze Age date (circa 1000-800 BC). The axhead is complete and suffers minimal damage. Where damage it occurs it is chiefly along the blade, although there are some other scuff marks elswhere. The uneven patina along much of the blade suggests that some of this damage occurred whilst the object was in the ground.



The axehead measures 109.2 mm long and 41.3 mm wide. It weighs 261.5 grams. It tapers from 41 mm thick at the socketed end to 2 mm thick at the blade. The axe is hollow, with a socket for attachment of a haft. The socket is sub-rectangular in shape and measures 41 mm by 41 mm. The axehead is waisted, tapering slightly from the socket to the centre, and then flaring again to the blade. A raised collar runs around the axehead at approximately 15 mm from the socket. On each side four decorative ribs emanate from this collar, running for approximately 33 mm in the direction of the blade. On one edge, situated just after the collar, there is a semi-circular moulded attachment loop. On each edge there is a casting seam which runs down the length of the axe.



The axehead has a fairly even dark green patina with patches of paler green copper corrosion in places. This axe fits within the socketed and faceted axe typology; specifically into the division type Meldreth which is broadly dated to the Late Bronze Age. It is associated with the later phases of the Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and earlier phases of the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII).

The patina on the awl is a deep even green. Together with the size and form of the awl, the patina suggests a late Bronze Age date (c. 1250-700 BC), although leather working tools did not change from this period through into the Roman period and even into the medieval period.","

It consists of a tapering, hollow shaft, broken at both ends, two flattened, lozenge-shaped side loops, and two short sections of the blade, most of which is missing. It is probable that the blade was leaf-shaped. What remains of the spearhead corresponds with Davis Groups 5 or 6. Davis (2017) notes that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly. The mid rib is D-shaped in section on one face and triangular in section on the other, probably as a result of a slight deformity in the casting mould. The spearhead has a dark green patina.

The socket is broken just below the base of the blade wings in a diagonal break that appears quite deliberate. The socket extends c. 28.3mm into the fragment. The midrib is more rounded on one side of the blade and has a more obvious ridge on the other. At the break to the blade a lozengiform cross-section is revealed, with the midrib section continuing in tapering flat triangles to each side. The bevel to the outside edges of the blade is c. 3.0mm. Naturally the loops are adjacent to the midrib, but almost seem like an afterthought rather than an integral feature. They are formed within a heavily scored area extending c. 30mm up the blade from the socket/blade junction. The perforations forming the loops begin between around 8 and 12mm up from the junction respectively. They are thin and oval. On the outer edge there is no integral loop plate. The unusual characteristics of this spearhead make its attribution as a basal-looped type tentative, although an example illustrated in Savory (1980, 175; ref. 232) is comparable.

The cutting edge is expanded and worn but apparently undamaged. Both faces are pitted and the shorter looks 'caved in' at the edge - conducive with a hammer blow. All breaks are old.


The socket is rectangular in cross-section, and the fragment itself triangular in cross-section.


While the axehead is rather small, it is difficult to say whether or not it is 'votive'. It may have just had a use as a small axehead. However the probable hammer blow could well be ritualistic - although it could equally represent the scrapping of metal, the hoards of which are so prevalent during the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC).

421182,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1150,"A cast copper-alloy palstave of middle Bronze Age date. The axe is in reasonable condition, although there is damage to the butt, some of which is missing, and other scuff marks on the blade and body of the axe. The palstave is fairly short and chunky with maximum dimensions of 96.86 mm long, 43.39 mm wide, 24.06 mm thick and 200.5 grams in weight. A U shaped flange is situated at the butt end of the axe, terminating in a stop ridge at the palstave's thickest point. On both sides, immediately after the stop ridge there are angled grooves which form a 'shield' or lozenge shaped central rib which continues in a subtle way down the blade of the axe after the grooves finish. The blade is slightly faceted and is crescent shaped in plan, triangular in profile. The axe has a dark grey patina with areas of green corrosion where it has been damaged, particularly on one edge, the blade and at the butt and septum, though it is pock marked with corrosion at many points.



The palstave has its closest parallel illustrated in Schmidt and Burgess (1981: pl. 61. no.833) which is a defined as a group 3 low flanged palstave dating to c. 1400-1150 cal BC. No exact parallels are illustrated by Rowlands (1976: pl. 86 hoard 73 item 5) although he considers recessed decoration similar in form to be a developed shield pattern found on Class 1 group 5 palstaves found typically in Hampshire. it is appropriate to suggest that this therefore fits within the larger developed shield pattern group within this study thought to also date to c, 1400-1150 cal BC.

422831,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A heavily abraded cast bronze un-looped palstave with central rib below the stop ridge and raised flange facets of Middle Bronze Age dating (1500 - 1100 BC).











The palstave measures 148.24mm in length, maximum surviving blade width is 52.95mm, socket width is 27.37mm and it is 23.41mm thick. It weighs 357 grams.


The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a probable convex blade edge. The cutting edge has been lost. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being in front of  the stop ridge. The surviving blade length (measured from the blade edge to the stop ridge) is 82.62mm,  and the surviving width of blade edge is 52.95mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 5.01mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 14.60mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 29.89mm). Beneath the stop-ridge, on one side of the palstave, is a tapering central raised rib. This rib extends approximately half way down the length of the blade, the point of termination has been lost through abrasion. The surface on the other side has been lost through abrasion, it is possible that a shield shaped motif was present. The convex cutting edge of the blade is lost through corrosion, abrasion and probably wear. The exposed edge is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This may be due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion. 


The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 63.60mm long, 21.24mm wide and 6.20mm thick. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The width at the butt is 23.94mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe are similar to each other, however one side retains more of the original surface. Two air bubbles, or casting flaws, are present on the more abraded side.


The palstave is a light - mid green colour with areas of thick well formed patina and exposed areas of abraded metal. It is likely that abrasion and corrosion has spread and affected 40% of the surface of the axe. However, this corrosion seems to be relatively stable at present and relatively few areas of light green active powdery corrosion can be observed, mainly along the blade edge. These areas should be monitored to ensure that further active corrosion does not occur. The septum has retained the majority of the original surface patina, unlike more exposed areas, where it has flaked off due to abrasion.











This form and style of palstave fits into the Acton Park metal working tradition which is dated to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC, Needham's Period 5 (1500 - 1150 BC) (Needham, 1996, pp133). Several comparative examples of this type of palstave have been published. These consist of  #797, a Type Coed Llan related example from Yorkshire (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, pp128); #650 from Bardon Hill, Leicestershire (Rowlands, 1976, pp315); #153 from St Fagans, Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, pp104) and #155 from Llanfedw, Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, pp105). Three similar examples have been recorded on the PAS database from Staffordshire (LVPL-3EFEA7 from Biddulph; WMID-AC04C7 from Cheadle; WMID-262202 from King's Bromley).

423415,Sickle,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"A copper alloy socket from a Bronze Age Sickle. The socket is conical with a rounded end and the mouth is complete with a slightly bevelled edge. There is an irregular hole in one side of the socket. The start of a blade with curved ribs projects to one side and points downwards. The ribs are on both faces and are matched. The object is broken across the blade. It has a well developed mottled green patina.



According to Fox's 1939 paper in The Prehistoric Society Journal, socketed sickles can have lateral or vertical sockets. This one is laterally socketed (which seems to be more common), but is a little more unusual in have ins closed top to the socket, but with the blade hardly projecting over the top of the socket. This example is most similar to Fox's suggested phases of development 4 or 5, and the ridged decoration on the blade seems similar to sickles believed to have developed in Ireland. Fox suggests that the earliest sickles developed in the lowlands of the UK, then spreading to Ireland and the Highland zones. The main distribution in 1939 was in South Wales, East Anglia, Ireland and Eastern Scotland, with a notable scarcity of examples from the Midlands and Northern England.



The sickle has some similarities with two sickles in Evans's Bronze Age implement corpus (1881). He illustrates two ribbed examples; fig 236 Near Errol, Perthshire and 237 Garvagh, Derry, page 200. The former is the most similar (Peter Reavill pers comm). These sickles are better known in Ireland and East Anglia and are comparatively rare elsewhere (Laura McLean pers comm). There is also an example in Devizes Museum (Katie Hinds pers comm).

433217,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1150,"A complete, but concreted, Middle Bronze Age cast copper-alloy palstave axehead from the Acton Park (phase 2) or Taunton phases, probably Taunton (c. 1500 - c. 1150 BC). It is unlooped with high, curved flanges (max. H.: 26.9mm), fused to the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) measures 70.3mm by c. 16mm. The width at the butt is 19.45mm. The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum height of c. 9.6mm above the septum. The stop ridge is stands c. 6mm above the septum. There is a shield shaped moulding beyond the stop ridge, and fused to it, on both faces (c. 19.5 by 18.0mm). This is bisected by a moulding ridge (seam) running the length of the axehead on both faces (including the septum); this starts on the lower blade and terminates before the butt. Each side of the ridge, within the shield, are two moulded longitudinal decorative ridges (forming a slight trident). There are further longitudinal ridges (casting seams) central on the sides; these have been finished by trimming the casting flash and hammering. The blade is 52.7mm across, with an edge bevel c. 9mm long (but obscured by accretions).  The object has suffered mild corrosion, and slight abrasions to one of the flanges. Where it survives the patina is dark brown; the metal is generally a mid-brown colour, slightly reddish. Spread all over the palstave are orange concretions presumably from local iron deposits.



The palstave fits into Rowlands' Class 1, developed shield pattern Group 2 palstaves; many developed shield pattern palstaves have been found in the Southampton area (ibid., 29), perhaps in emulation of what is generally an East Anglian form. This form of axehead fits within the corpus from the later Middle Bronze Age (MBA II), of metalworking tradition phase VIII / IX, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 5 1500-1150CAL. BC. It fits best within the Taunton metalworking tradition although has elements common with those seen with the second phase of the Acton Park tradition. The Rowlands distribution of these is useful, but as his corpus was produced in 1976 it does not include more recent Middle Bronze Age finds which might refine it. A similarly decorated shield can be seen on a palstave from Bottisham, Cambs, illustrated in Rowlands (1976, 293/Plate 27; ref. 339). There are many examples of palstaves with cast ribs on the septum, however the majority of these are grouped in threes rather than singly as on this example; a good parallel can be seen on a palstave from a hoard of 14 from Quex Park, Birchington, Hertfordshire (ibid., 246/Plate 10; ref. 10). This hoard seems to have been contained within a globular 'Deveral Rimbury style' urn.","

433341,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of uncertain type and probably of Ewart Park metalworking industry dated to 950 - 750BC (Needham 1996).



The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 42.32mm and a weight of 87.4g). The axe is of sub-hexagonal section at the break (with a width of 44.3mm and a thickness of 9.7mm). One face of the axe is considerably thicker than the other (4.8mm compared to 2.9mm) because of misalignment of the core during casting, which may have caused weaknesses in the axe. The sides are moderately straight to concave for the short surviving section before diverging to the blade edge. The casting seams are discernible on the sides and appear to have been hammer-finished. The blade edge has been lost but was curved (with a surviving width of 47.3mm). The socket of the axe is now closed and both faces are concave across their widths, indicating that the axes faces were crushed. Both faces also display numerous battering marks and the thinner face has torn through the battering. Sharpening striations are evident running along the blade. The surface has a dark green patina where it survives and is pale green elsewhere.



Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC although most recovered socketed axes are of EwartPark phase. The axe may have been of South Wales (Stogursey) type although the blade is comparatively broad for the type.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2009-03-11T00:00:00Z,,,,87.4,,,,42.32,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Bridgend,Bridgend,Pencoed,SS9480,,51.508954,-3.528785,NMGW-A4F441,,2009.140.1.jpg,Socketed Axehead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.140.1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/320344.jpg
433463,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2100,-1900,"A cast copper-alloy axehead of early Bronze Age date. The axehead is incomplete, missing the end of the butt. It is of late Migdale metalworking tradition, dating to Stage III of the early Bronze Age, spanning Needham's Period 2, c. 2,300 to 2,050 BC and the beginning of Period 3, c. 2050 to 1700 BC (Needham 1996, 127 - 130). The axehead suffers from damage to the tip and edges of the blade. This is probably post-depositional, as the patina on the breaks differs from that of the undamaged parts of the axe. The same can probably be said of the damage at the butt, although the damage here does not appear to have occurred very recently. Although damaged, the blade is convex in shape and the sides of the axe are slightly convex, tapering towards the butt and flaring towards the blade. There are very slight ridges at either edge of the face on both sides. A ridge also runs down each edge of the axe, making it pointed lozenge shaped in section. The axe tapers gradually in thickness from 9.99 mm at the broken butt end to 3.63 mm at the blade. Both faces exhibit faint longitudinal markings which run from the broken butt to the tip of the blade.  On other examples these are decorative rather than evidence for sharpening, as they appear to be cast and sometimes terminate before the blade (see DENO-93FB17 for example, on this database). These are probably also decorative on this example. Striations, probably caused by sharpening, are also visible on the blade. 











The axehead measures 119.5 mm in length, 32.6 mm wide at the broken point of the butt and 89 mm wide at the widest part of the blade. It weighs 331.3 grams. It has a dark brown patina with considerable evidence for wear. There are areas of green bronze corrosion at the tip of the blade and the break at the butt, as well in small areas of the face. The axehead probably dates to between 2100 and 1900 BC,",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-11-01T00:00:00Z,2010-11-30T00:00:00Z,,,331.3,,,9.99,119.5,1,Tom Brindle,Tom Brindle,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Hamstall Ridware,SK1118,Generated from computer mapping software,52.759497,-1.838439,WMID-DCC172,,WMID-DCC172.jpg,Early Bronze Age copper-alloy flat axe,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tbrindle/WMID-DCC172.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/320418.jpg
435317,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1500,400,"Copper alloy (bronze) casting waste of uncertain date; most probably Mid - Late Bronze Age (1500-700 BC). However, due to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from Bronze Age - Roman period (c. 1500 BC - 450 AD). This fragment is from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould. The casting waste is conical; being oval in plan and D shaped in cross section. In profile the edges of the waste taper relatively evenly. The base of the casting waste is irregular with the remains (nipples) of two runners / casting jets being present. These jets / runners are heavily abraded. The sides show no evidence of casting seams although they are also similarly abraded. The upper surface is pitted and rough, although heavily patinated: at the centre of the upper surface is a slight depression. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. The casting waste is a mid green colour with an abraded and corroded patina that covers all surfaces. Casting waste is very hard to date in isolation but the patina and form might suggest a Bronze Age - Roman date. The fact that this mould comes to an oval broken edge may suggest that it was for casting a palstave or possibly a tool; it is most likely to date from the Middle Bronze Age. A direct comparison has not been found. The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.

435732,Palstave,Bronze Age,,,,,"Denuded copper alloy unlooped palstave in two fragments, found some years ago in the top of a mound (GAT PRN 26156) at the above NGR whilst using a metal detector. 
 
The palstave has a flaring blade, although the cutting edge is no longer present and one tip is missing. The rounded stop-ridge is well-defined and a clear individual mid-rib runs from the stop-ridge towards the cutting edge of the blade (the terminus of the rib is unclear due to surface corrosion). Both features are extant on either side of the palstave, but are heavily eroded on one face only. The butt has also suffered significant damage from corrosion.
 
The palstave was cast-in-one and the total length would have been c. 145-50mm. The blade is sub-oval shape in cross-section with a protrusion in the centre of each face where the mid-rib runs across the surface. 
 
The fracture does not appear fresh, although it is unclear whether the item was found in two separate pieces or whether the break has occurred since its discovery. The surface appears to have been cleaned with an abrasive item such as wire wool, although a dark grey patina remains in places. The majority of the surface is pitted with green-tinged depressions and the palstave appears to have developed a defined waist as a result of corrosion c. 20mm from the stop-ridge.
 
The palstave appears to belong to the Acton Park industry, which emerged in north Wales at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. Although fine detail is difficult to discern on this item, it bears similarities to unlooped palstaves found at Holyhead Mountain, Ynys Môn; Fron-hir, Llanbister, Radnorshire; and those from Acton, Denbigh.

437304,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-2150,410,"A fragment of copper alloy, probable casting waste, possibly of Bronze Age dating (2150 BC to 800 BC). However, due to the lack of context and continuation of casting styles, this fragment could be dated from the Bronze Age through to the Roman Period (c.2150 BC - 410 AD).



The fragment is sub triangular in plan, and roughly D shaped in cross section. It has an irregular, rough surface. It is most likely part of a copper ingot, prior to being smelted and cast. It is a mid to dark green colour. A couple of small areas of iron staining, probably due to impurities in the copper. An even patina covers the surface.


It measures 43.87mm in length, 24.86mm wide and 12.81mm thick. It weighs 36.8 grams.




In appearance, the fragment does display some similarities to a barbed and tanged arrowhead shape. However arrowheads made from copper alloy are incredibly rare and tend to be almost flat in profile, it is highly improbable that this fragment is a Bronze Age arrowhead. Due to the weight and appearance of the fragment, it is more likely that it is a small piece of a copper ingot, produced from the smelting of the copper ore, in preparation for casting.

442844,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1250,-100,"A cast copper alloy 'moustache' shaped object of uncertain use. The object is three-dimensional and consists of a pair of drooping ovoid elements with pointed tips, hence 'moustache' shaped. These ovoids are decorated with multiple grooves running down the body of each ovoid but stopping before the tip. In the centre of the two drooping ovoids is a recessed band running around the waist of the object. On the underside is a rectangular hole; it appears that this hole may have continued through and perforated the top but this has been filled at some point with a small amount of copper alloy. 


The use and date of these objects remains enigmatic. A number of these have now been recovered and several are recorded on the PAS database, including WMID-CA9D04, BH-037A57 and SF-520513. There is some variation in these objects, some have very pronounced but slimmer ovoids with long tips, others are short and squat. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117), and as such they are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age, but without stratified examples this is unconfirmed. It is possible that these objects may have been dagger fittings, with the hole a rest for the tang, but again without any evidence this is speculation.

445530,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed Hammer of Bronze Age dating.


The socketed hammer is rectangular in plan and cross section, and cuboid in shape. Each face exhibits a panel of ridged decoration at the top, and U shaped recess at the base. Casting ridges are present down each side, and have been smoothed off. The tip has been bevelled. At the base of the socket, some white residue or possibly clay soil remnants are present.


The socketed hammer is in good condition, with an even surface patina. It is a dark green colour. There are a couple of areas of more recent plough damage.


The hammer measures 57.01mm in length, 24.57mm wide and 22.53mm thick. The socket is 38.31mm deep and the thickness of the metal around the socket is 3.80mm. It weighs 97.4 grams.


Comment from Brendan O'Connor: This hammer has a ribbed collar and a bipartite body. It looks as if the  upper, socketed part of the body is distinguished from the solid 'business end'  of the hammer. The short surviving  length of this presumably solid portion suggests the hammer was well used.   


Comment from Dot Broughton (Cumbria FLO): They date from 1000-800BC and are, like Peter says, usually found in LBA hoards  (e.g. Bunwell, Norfolk). There's a socketed hammer from the Scottish  hoard at Adabrock. They  are usually found with Ewart Park sword fragments, South Eastern socketed axes,  Meldreth Type socketed and other faceted axes and an arrangement of various  chisels and other tools, etc. I think it's the hoard from Carleton Rd, Norwich,  Norfolk that is probably the best example for LBA tools (though there's not  socketed hammer in that hoard!). There are a couple of stray finds on the  database - like LBA axes and chisels, most of them are from hoards, but some are  stray finds. 


Comment from Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO): Inventaria Archaeologica Hawkes 1956, and the hammer is similar in overall shape - with the stepped mouth to an example in the Isle of Harty hoard (GB.18.3.3.22) although the base does not narrow and taper like yours. The moulding of the grooves can be seen in an example from the Reach Fen Hoard, Cambs GB.17.3.3.24 which I think is the best parallel. I can see nothing in Evans - agree with dates and associations that Dot provides - an odd one for Yorkshire


Comment from Terence Manby: Finds of Bronze hammers, apart from doubtful fragments, are know from two Yorkshire hoards -  Kilnhurst, near Rotherham, crude plain examples (GB. 41.5 & 6; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, Pl. 138 B 2 & 5) and Roseberry Topping, near Stokesley, plain collar and thicken rim (Schmidt & Burgess 1981. Pl. 148 D 6).       The multiple ridged collar may be comparable with the ridged collars of the Type Fulford socketed axes - Wallington Industry - that are not at all common across Yorkshire and Northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981. 176-7).","

The socketed gouge is near-complete, with some peripheral damage around the mouth and blade (with a surviving length of 77.2mm and a weight of 50.5g). The mouth is circular (with a diameter of 20.5mm) with no mouth mouldings. The gouge flares outwards slightly to the mouth (with a diameter beneath the mouth of 18mm). Beneath the flaring mouth, the sides of the gouge are straight and slightly convergent (producing a blade width of 15.4mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been carefully finished, probably by hammering. The blade comprises a shallow U-shaped depression (beginning 43mm from the current blade edge), which is filled with prominent striations running along the channel from top to bottom. The striations are unlikely to be purely from sharpening and possibly are partly decorative. The blade edge has been lost but does not appear to be expanded. There is a groove running diagonally from the mouth to the side of the blade, which has appears to have some patination internally, suggesting that it may be damage from antiquity or a possibly a flaw in the mould. The surface has a dark green patina where it survives and elsewhere is pale green. The colour of the patina has been altered by a recent oily coating by the finder.

449307,Spear,Bronze Age,,,-1500,-750,"Bronze Age bronze socketed spearhead, of pegged type and of Greenwell and Brewis' (1909, 458-460)  Type V. Class V spear heads are ascribed to the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age, corresponding with Needham's (1996)  Periods 6 and 7, dated to 1150 - 750BC.

The spearhead is complete (with a length of 113.8mm and a weight of 67.3g). The socket is near circular (with an external diameter at the mouth of 23.5-24.1mm, an internal diameter of 18mm and a thickness of 2.6mm). The sides of the socket are straight and convergent. The shaft was attached through two circular rivet holes (3.3 and 3.6mm diameter, positioned 11-12mm from the mouth). The blade is flame shaped, where the blade is convex to its widest point (with a width of 29.2mm) and is then slightly concave to the tip. Blade facets are evident on both sides and faces (1.6mm from the edge) and no sharpening striations are discernible. The blades are slightly thicker against the socket (with a thickness of 3mm) and thin towards the edge (with a thickness of 1mm before the blade facet). The socket continues as a prominent and wide midrib to the tip.

The spearhead has applied decoration around the socket, beneath the start of the blade. The decoration comprises four bands of liner striations flanked on each side by repeating chevrons or small punched triangles and undecorated strips (2-3mm wide) separate the decorative bands. Beneath the blade is a border of small punched triangles above 6-7 linear striations (with a width of 1.8mm). At the base of the striations is a double-incised zigzag or line of adjoining chevrons. After a plain strip, the three motifs are repeated but the linear striations are interrupted by the two rivet holes. Punched triangles border the rivet holes on the top and bottom and beneath each rivet hole are triple incised opposing chevrons, within the 'undecorated' strip. A further band of linear striations is flanked on its lower side by punched triangles, with no further motif above. The basal band of striations is flanked on its upper side only with repeating chevrons. The decoration has been finely incised and carefully applied. 

The golden bronze surface survives over much of the lower part of the spearhead. A dark grey to brown corrosion is adhering to the surface elsewhere. The socket has mostly been cleaned out but remnant traces, of possibly wood survive.


Socketed and riveted (Class V) spearheads have been recorded from Wales,  such as the example from the Llantwit Major hoard in the Vale of  Glamorgan (Savory, 1980, p 121, no. 281.14) . Decorated spearheads have  also been recorded, for example at Guilsfield in Powys one of the  spearheads has punched dot decoration around the socket and base of the  blade (Savory, 1980, p 118, no. 268.18). The Swansea Bay spearhead can  be closely paralleled with an example found in the River Thames at  Staines and now in the Museum of London collections , published by  Needham et al (1987) . The Staines spearhead is also of socketed,  riveted type with a flame blade and also has applied decoration  encircling the socket mouth, comprising five bands of striations with no  chevrons or punched decoration. The Staines spearhead was radiocarbon  dated from wood surviving in the shaft and produced a date of 1100BC -  840BC (with a 95% probability). As early as 1909 (Greenwell &  Brewis, p 470) noted the use of vertical and horizontal lines, zigzags  and triangle motifs on arrowheads of looped and riveted types. It is  possible to suggest that the liner incised decoration on both examples  may be referencing binding on earlier, looped spearheads.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2009-06-25T23:00:00Z,,,,67.3,,,,113.8,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,Swansea,Swansea,,,,,,PUBLIC-0919A7,,2009.235.1i.jpg,Bronze Age socketed spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2009.235.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/333605.jpg

The pin is complete (with a distorted length of 237mm, a straightened length of approximately 270mm and a weight of 32.7g). The head has a slightly oval mouth (13.4mm - 14.3mm external diameter, 12mm internal diameter and 3mm deep). The sides of the cup-head are straight and parallel before curving sharply to the shaft. The interior of the cup-head contains no discernible decoration and is filled with corrosion. The pin shaft is of circular section and has a prominent swelling beneath the head (positioned 20mm beneath the head and producing a maximum diameter of 7.8mm). Beneath the swelling, there appears to be a slight rounded lug on one side of the shaft (8mm long, 2mm thick and 2mm high). The shaft gradually thins to the comparatively wide tip. No applied decoration is evident on the pin. The surface is mostly encrusted with sand and shell, and elsewhere has a grey brown surface.


The pin has been problematic to date due to the lack of cultural affinities, however, Eogan (1974, p 98-101)  has stated that Cup-headed pins are   characteristic of Late Bronze Age Ireland. The size of the head of this   example, may be seen as comparatively small, where Irish examples vary   from 16-27mm (ibid) but the length of the shaft is comparatively   massive. Cup-headed pins have a sparse distribution in Britain with only   three recorded examples by O'Connor (1980, p 560) , with the Swansea   pin representing the furthest west example recovered in mainland   Britain.

450104,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1000,"Bronze Age bronze blade, probably of Middle Bronze Age date



The blade is incomplete, with some peripheral damage and distortion (with a distorted surviving length of 66.3mm and a weight of 13.3g). The hilt had straight and parallel or near-parallel sides (with a width of 21.1mm) and the top edges are angled to meet at the centre. The two rivet holes were circular (with a diameter of 4.5mm) and one is open at the side. The hilt is thinnest at the butt and thickens at a point above the rivet holes, where the midrib is discernible as a ridge. The midrib widens beneath the rivet holes and produces a maximum thickness at the top of the blade (of 3.8mm). The better preserved side suggests that there is a step from the hilt to the blade edge (where the blade has a width of 18.0mm). The blade edges were probably straight or near-straight and converge towards the break. The midrib narrows slightly towards the break and is very slightly convex across its width on the blade, with the blade facets being gently concave. The blade is thinner at the break or tip (at 1.5mm). Much of the damage to the blade edge is likely to be post-depositional but it is possible that some of the notches may have resulted from use or deliberate damage. The surface has a dark-green to brown patina with areas of pale green corrosion. There are no discernible sharpening striations on the blade.


It is possible that the blade is an eroded dirk, although it would be comparatively small and the hilt arrangement is a little unusual. It is also possible that the blade has been reworked from a larger dirk or rapier. Dirks are present throughout the Middle Bronze Age, with the earliest examples of Acton Park metalwork, dated from c. 1600-1400BC and continue through to Willburton metalworking dated to c. 1150-1000BC, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Periods 5 - 6. This example is more likely to date from the later part of the suggested range.","Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefacts was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The objects were examined whole within the specimen chamber and were analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion. 

Three separate readings were taken and the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable with other results the average compositions were: 81-89 % copper, 8-12 % tin, 1-2 % antimony and less than 1 % lead. The comparatively high level of antimony, if correct is unusual and may suggest a date later than the early Bronze Age. Comparable levels of antinomy have been found in Later metal work, such as in a number of items in the Guilsfield Hoard, characterised as Wilberton metalwork. All of the Early Bronze age daggers published by Gerloff (1975, p 167-8) have lower levels of antimony. However, the very low levels of lead would be unusual in Late Bronze Age metalwork.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-16T23:00:00Z,2010-07-06T23:00:00Z,,,13.3,,,,66.3,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Holt,ST8561,,51.3478791,-2.21676275,PUBLIC-4425B2,,2010.1i.jpg,middle bronze age blade,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334224.jpg

The palstave is incomplete and is fragmentary, missing the butt and broken near the stop (with a surviving length of 133.4mm and a weight of 343.2g). The palstave has broken before the butt (where it has a width of 21.9mm, a thickness at the septum of 6.5mm and a flange height of 13.1mm). The septum has a U-shaped profile before the rounded stop. The flanges (with a maximum height of 27.7mm) are not as deep as the stop height (at 30.6mm high) but may have suffered some damage. The tops of the flanges have a fairly linear convergence towards the butt. The sides of the palstave are straight as far as the blade, before gradually widening to the damaged blade tips. The casting flashes are evident on both sides and have been finished, probably by hammering but remain prominent, particularly along the sides of the blade. There are unusual mouldings running across both sides, corresponding with the position of the stops. The maximum blade thickness (at 22mm) is less than the stop height, defining a bar ledge stop. The flanges do not continue as ribs along the edges of the blade faces. The original blade edge and the tips have been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 55.0mm) and the blade edge has a moderate curve. A blade facet is discernible on both faces (up to 10mm from the damaged blade edge). The blade face is decorated with a sunken shield pattern and a midrib; the midrib does not continue into the shield as seen on the three-pronged trident' decoration. Angled striations running off the blade edge may be the result of sharpening. The palstave surface has a dark green patina where it survives and elsewhere is pitted and pale green. Occasional air bubbles are evident on the surface and are frequent through the break, demonstrating casting problems and resulting in weaknesses.

The axe appears to be complete (with a length of 58.5mm and a weight of 22.4g). The butt is rounded (with a width of 11mm) and the axe is of sub-rectangular section. The axe has discernible median bevels on both faces (28mm from the blade). The sides are near-parallel as far as the median bevel (where the axe has a width of 13.3mm and has a maximum thickness of 6.5mm). From the bevel, the sides are straight and divergent to the blade edge. The blade edge is moderately curved (with a width of 16.9mm) and no blade facet is now discernible, there are no flanges evident on the axe. Very little of the original surface survives with a dark brown patina; elsewhere the surface is pitted and is pale to mid green.


The axe is of a diminutive size, even for Type Bandon, Variant Swinton and it remains unclear whether the axe had a practical purpose or was votive. It is possible that the 'axe' may have been used for delicate tasks, perhaps similar to a chisel. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is two-thirds of the size of these axes, it may have been used for a similar function.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-22T23:00:00Z,2010-07-14T23:00:00Z,,,22.4,,,,58.5,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Dorstone,SO3142,,52.07204898,-3.00810352,PUBLIC-494006,,2010.4.2i.jpg,Early Bronze Age developed flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.4.2i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334326.jpg

The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 38.1mm and a weight of 134.2g). The axe has broken near the base of the socket (with a length of 29.0mm, a surviving width of 7mm and a maximum surviving depth of 9mm). The axe is of rectangular section at the break, with convex sides across their thicknesses (where the axe has a width of 49mm and a maximum thickness of 20.3mm). The casting flashes are clear and raised on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The sides curve-out sharply to produce an expanded, recurved edge, although one of the blade tips has been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 70.1mm). The blade faces are convex across both their lengths and width with no discernible blade facets. There are no ribs extending onto the blade fragment and no discernible sharpening striations on the blade edge. There are deep scratches of random direction on both faces which appear to have patinated, suggesting they may have occurred in antiquity. The surface has a dark brown patination.


The blade fragment appears to be from a comparatively substantial axe, although the fragmentary nature makes the typological identification difficult. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although most recovered socketed axes are of Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-15T23:00:00Z,,,,134.2,,,,38.1,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Wenvoe,ST0870,,51.4215187,-3.32451035,PUBLIC-496574,,2010.5.1i.jpg,late bronze age socketed axe fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.5.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334328.jpg

The axe is fragmentary, broken in antiquity around the approximate mid-section with the blade end represented. The fragment suggests a comparatively small axe (with a surviving length of 47.7mm and a weight of 53.6g). The socket is sub-oval with straight, parallel ends (with a length of 27.0mm, a surviving width of 14.1mm and a maximum surviving depth of 32.8mm). The axe has a sub-hexagonal body section at the break (with a width at the break of 33.5mm and a maximum surviving thickness of 18.8mm). The casting flashes are evident and raised on both sides and appear to have been roughly finished by hammering. The sides are near parallel and only diverge slightly to the eroded blade tips (producing a surviving blade width of 38.2mm). The original blade edge does not survive and is comparatively straight. The blade faces are slightly convex across their widths and flat (but convergent) across their lengths with prominent blade facets discernible on both faces (c. 13mm from the present blade edge). There are now no ribs extending onto the blade fragment, although the surface loss on the upper part of the fragment may have irradiated the lower parts of any ribs. No sharpening striations are discernible on the blade edge where the surface survives. Some of the original surface survives with a dark brown patination, elsewhere there are areas of active bronze corrosion.


The blade fragment appears to be from a comparatively small axe, although the fragmentary nature makes the typological identification difficult. The hexagonal body section and crude finishing may suggest an axe of South Wales Type. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although this axe is likely to date to the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-06-29T23:00:00Z,,,,53.6,,,,47.7,1,Simone-Louise Johnson,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,Torfaen,Torfaen,Ponthir,ST3294,,51.640673,-2.984055,PUBLIC-9BD5E6,,2010.26.1i.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.26.1i.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/334949.jpg

The end of the circular socket is present at the break (where it has a surviving depth of 17.6mm and an internal diameter at the break of 7.0mm). The socket continues along the blade as a prominent and rounded midrib (giving a maximum surviving thickness of 9.2mm at the break), which gradually narrows and thins towards the tip.

Description



Ingot, fragment. Plano-convex edge fragment with rounded outer edge. Length: 74.5mm, Width: 62.5mm, Thickness: c.31mm



Ingot, fragment. Plano-convex. Length: 92.5mm, Width: 90mm, Thickness: c. 32mm.



Discussion



These ingot fragments probably belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, dating to c.1000-800 BC. Both fragments are plano-convex, being rounded on one side and flat on the other. Ingots such as these were cast in a dish-shaped mould, and are often referred to as 'bun' ingots due to their shape. Ingots of raw metal were transported and traded throughout Britain and Europe during the Late Bronze Age. They were frequently broken up into fragments, ready to be smelted to make a range of bronze weaponry, tools and ornaments. Ingots (and ingot fragments) are a regular feature of LBA hoard deposits in southern England (cf. Turner 2010, 86-7). Numerous plano-convex ingot fragments have been recovered in Devon and the surrounding regions (e.g. Powell 2005a; 2005b), most notably the copper and tin ingots recovered from a probable shipwreck site off the coast of Salcombe (Roberts & Veysey 2011; Needham et al. forthcoming). Scientific analysis is currently being undertaken on the Salcombe finds at the British Museum (B. Roberts pers comm.). The Paignton finds are therefore significant for their potential (subject to future analysis) to reveal information regarding patterns of trade and exchange in the Late Bronze Age period in South-West of Britain.



Conclusion



As these two Late Bronze Age ingots were found within 1.5m of each other, they are most likely to originate from a single deposit, which has been dispersed. This material is eligible as Treasure under the Treasure Order (2002), as it is a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects.

The oval shaped mouth (36.79x30.07mm) is a single, outward-projecting moulding max.7.11mm thick from which extend ?4 vertical ribs on one face. The other face is badly damaged but at least 2 ribs are visible. At the edges of the axehead the casting flashes are visible, but have been worn down a little. On one of these sides a loop extends 25mm from the mouth moulding.


The damage is worn but probably not ancient. It could well have been casued by plough damage. Interestingly the damage is consistent with a large blow on one side, which is sometimes attributed to contemporary ritual destruction of the obect.

The axe is complete (with a length of 155.3mm and a weight of 507.3g). The butt is moderately rounded and thin (with a width of 38.4mm and a thickness of 3mm). The sides are concave, narrowing to a point near the butt (with a width of 36.1mm and 35mm from the butt), before gradually diverging to approximately the midpoint and diverging sharply to the blade. The sides have been carefully hammered to produce a bevel and a central ridge. The blade is moderately curved and is unexpanded at the tips (producing a blade width of 82.3mm). There is no evidence of flanges on the edges of the face but the axe has a lozenge-shaped long section, indicating it to be of 'Developed' form. The median bevel occurs at the midpoint of the axe (approximately 77mm from the butt, where the axe has a maximum thickness of 13.5mm and a width of 41.1mm). The axe faces are convex across their widths at the blade and butt and are near-flat at the mid-section. A gentle blade facet is discernible on both faces (occurring around 11mm from the blade edge). There is no evidence of applied decoration on the axe and no definite sharpening striations at the blade. The surface is heavily-pitted with a pale-green corrosion; patches of the original surface survive with a silvery, dark-green patina. 


Aylseford axes are typologically the most primitive and therefore the earliest of the Developed axe types (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 60) . This find represents the thirteenth known example of a recorded Aylesford type axe from Wales, with a general distribution centred on Glamorganshire and eastern Gwent for the seven examples from South Wales.","Metallurgical analysis  was attempted, with the axe examined whole within the specimen chamber. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from under the surface corrosion were analysed and apart from very superficial surface swabbing of the artefact there was no sample preparation. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefact, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion. 

Four separate readings were taken and the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable with other results. The average results showed the axe composition to be an unleaded tin-bronze containing 84.3% - 92.0% (with a mean of 83.9%) copper with 7.8% - 23.9% (with a mean of 15.4%) tin.

The axe is complete (with a length of 109.2mm and a weight of 356.1g). The butt is thin or sharp and arched (with a width of 36.9mm and a thickness of 2mm). Both faces are convex, giving the axe a lenticular body profile, with the thickest point (at 12.5mm) on the blade, approximately two-thirds of the way along the axe (around 40mm from the blade edge). There is no median bevel or blade facet on the faces, although the blade narrows sharply to the edge. The faces are flat across their widths, gradually becoming increasing convex towards the blade edge. The sides of the axe are straight and divergent along the upper half of the axe and are concave along the blade, turning out sharply at the ends to produce blade tips (which give the blade a width of 67.0mm).

The axe is fragmentary, represented by the blade only (with a surviving length of 33.1mm and a weight of 64.6g). The axe has broken near the base of the socket (with a length of 31.0mm, a surviving width of 9.9mm and a maximum surviving depth of 9.1mm). The axe is of sub-rectangular section at the break (where the axe has a width of 41mm and a maximum thickness of 18.0mm). The casting flashes are clear and raised on both sides and appear to have been finished by hammering. The sides curve outwards a little to produce a slightly expanded edge (producing a surviving blade width of 46.9mm). The blade faces are convex across both their lengths and width with no discernible blade facets and the original blade edge has been lost. There are no ribs extending onto the blade fragment. Where the surface survives, sharpening striations are evident running along the blade edge. Hammering facets are also discernible on both faces. The surface has a dark brown patination and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion.


The fragmentary state of the axe makes typological identification difficult; the form of the fragment is consistent with South Wales Type socketed axes. Socketed axes can date to the Wilburton metalworking phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated to c. 1150-950BC; or to Llyn Fawr, dated to 750-450BC, although most recovered socketed axes, including the South Wales type are of the Ewart Park phase (950-750BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-05-04T23:00:00Z,2010-06-18T23:00:00Z,,,64.6,,,,33.1,1,Mark Lodwick,Simone-Louise Johnson,Wales,Carmarthenshire,Carmarthenshire,Myddfai,,,,,PUBLIC-90F535,,2010.130.1i.JPG,Bronze Age Socketed Axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/simj3/2010.130.1i.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/339755.jpg

A central spine runs down the length of the fragment, with very worn and corroded edges remaining. In section, the blade is lozenge-shaped. While corrosion has undoubtably removed much of the blade, it seems likely that the blade edges has been worn through use in the Bronze Age and probably resharpened. The narrow point remaining on the fragment is probably due to breakage and corrosion of the dirk or rapier in the Bronze Age, with further corrosion in the post-depositional environment.


While the size of the fragment suggests the object was a dirk, comparison with rapiers from Northumberland indicates that it is only a few mm smaller in width at the shoulders in comparison with complete examples.

458653,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-700,"Bronze Age bronze spearhead fragment, of uncertain type and of Middle to Late Bronze Age date, c. 1500 - 700BC


The spearhead is fragmentary and is represented by the tip only (with a surviving length of 47.8mm and a weight of 22.7g). The spearhead has broken across the blade in antiquity and near the end of a circular socket (4.1mm diameter at the break and with a surviving depth of 5.8mm), positioned slightly off-centre. The fragment has a prominent rounded midrib (giving the spearhead a maximum surviving thickness of 10.5mm where the fragment has a maximum surviving width of 19.8mm). The midrib weakens slightly towards the tip but remains prominent. The original blade edges and tip have been lost, making the original outline uncertain but the more complete edge is gently convex and may originally have been straight or near-straight. Patches of the original surface survive with a dark-green patina. Sharpening striations are discernible running both along the blade and at an acute angle to the blade edge.


Socketed spearheads begin in the Acton Park metalworking industry dated to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age and continue to the Llyn Fawr Industry at the very end of the Bronze Age, although spearheads of the Llyn Fawr industry are rarely recovered, with most spearheads dating to the Ewart Park phase or before.

458783,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-700,"Bronze Age axe blade, probably of Middle to Late Bronze Age, c. 1,500 - 700BC


The axe is fragmentary, represented by part of the blade edge (with a surviving length of 25.6mm, a surviving width of 30.9mm, a maximum surviving thickness of 10.4mm and a weight of 37.7g). The surviving side is near-straight and slightly divergent to the blade tip (producing a surviving blade width of 30.0mm). The side suggests that the axe was of slightly hexagonal section. The casting seam is evident and has been fettled, seemingly by hammering. The axe faces were gently concave across their widths but slightly convex across their lengths. At the break there is the slight suggestion of a rectangular base to a socket, possibly suggesting that the axe has broken across the socket base, although the identification is somewhat speculative. There is a notch in the blade edge which seemingly occurred in antiquity. The current surface is heavily-pitted with a mid-green patina.


The casting seam on the axe implies a casting technology using a two or three piece mould technology and therefore an axe of cast-flanged type at the earliest, and more likely a palstave or socketed axe fragment.

The fragment consists of only the very tip of the spearhead - it has a narrow and slender tip with a pronounced midrib. The midrib is rounded in section and is flanked by tapering wings that join at the tip. There are pronounced edge bevels which are 3-4mm from the edge of the spear. The tip is slightly damaged and abraded. One of the wings has broken at the wider end but has been glued back together. The edges of the spear head are worn and chipped. The break at the wider end is patinated. The mid rib is hollow. Since only the tip of the spear head has survived it is not possible to identify an exact form or class of spear head. However, there are perhaps similarities to Triangular spear heads from the Penard Phase (1300 - 1140 BC) in the middle Bronze Age. Please compare to PAS record IDs: SWYOR-8E7758 and YORYM-6DB701. Should such an identification from the fragment be correct, the most likely classification would be of a 'projecting basal looped' spearhead, Davis Group 9.

462200,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-800,"An incomplete cast differentially corroded hook-shaped dense base-metal object, of probable Bronze Age dating.


The artefact is semi-circular in plan, and oval in cross section. It has a rectangular hollow opening, which still contains some soil. The top then flattens out before narrowing and curving to a point. In form and size it resembles the tusk of a pig or wild boar. Original, but longitudinally cracking surfaces survive on the interior concave curved side however original surfaces are almost entirely missing on the exterior convex shaped side.


Microscope examination of the exterior surface suggests a small area of original surface survives approximately 18-22mm from the tapering tip end, indicating that the object was probably originally tapered in shape and not broken or differentially eroded here. The original surfaces have a dark grey black patina, while the corroded surfaces are a mottled light to mid-grey color.


It measures 56.63mm in length, 37.60mm wide and 14.47mm thick. It weighs 40.4 grams.


Metallurgical analysis found the object to be made of pure tin.


Identification of this object is at present unknown, but it was found in the same hole, touching the Socketed Axe head, LVPL-F314E0, suggesting that it is of Bronze Age date and therefore potential Treasure. Tin was a key metal of the Bronze Age, alloyed with copper to form bronze. While there is no determining technological or compositional feature to confidently date this hook-shaped object specifically to the Late Bronze Age, its form and corrosion is consistent with being an ancient rather than a modern object.


Careful examination of the hook-shaped tin object suggests it was deliberately shaped as an attachment or handle to a larger object, although the possibilities of it being an unusually shaped adornment, talisman or ingot cannot be discounted. The hollowed-out, widened and sub-rectangular shaped top would appear to have been the point of attachment to a larger composite object, the head slotting into a peg or projecting fitting. Observation of the narrowing end with a microscope gives tentative support for it having been deliberately shaped and tapered, rather than the outcome of differential corrosion and damage since burial. This suggests that it was only secured at one end. It is possible that the tin hook was once the hidden core of a handle or attachment with a sheet or cast bronze outer surface.",,4,Tin or tin alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2011-08-20T23:00:00Z,,2011W27,,40.4,,,14.47,56.63,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,Wales,Flintshire,Flintshire,,,,,,LVPL-F33C38,,LVPL-F33C38.jpg,Bronze Age: Unidentified object,National Museums Liverpool ,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/LVPL-F33C38.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/345566.jpg

463768,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (probably bronze) socketed spear (spear head) of Middle to Late Bronze Age dating (1500 to 800 BC).



The spearhead fragment consists of the upper part of the spear, being broken at the top of the socket. The edges of the blade are lost. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a distinct bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is sub circular in shape and positioned toward one side of the section.



At the break the socket has an internal diameter of 6.00mm and the sockets depth is 12.17mm. The blade (sides) of the spearhead is incomplete having been heavily abraded in the burial environment. This damage has resulted in the loss of shape to the blade and the blunting / loss of the tip. The spear blades cutting edges have been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by an expanding (tip to base) lozenge sectioned shaped midrib. This midrib originally expanded into the socket of the spear. The central line of the mid-rib extends to break and is more distinct on one face. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead.



The spearhead is a dark brown to mid green colour with an even but much corroded patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface and patina. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket.



The spearhead fragment measures 65.57mm length, has a maximum width of 23.74mm and maximum thickness of 11.53mm. The spearhead weighs 33.1 grams



It is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.

464328,Fish Hook,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-2400,-450,"A copper object, made from circular-section wire which tapers from about 6mm in diameter at a blunt, squared-off wider end to about 4mm immediately below, then gently tapers to c. 3mm at the curve. It curves around a little over 180 degrees to form a hook which measures in total c. 42mm long by 24mm wide. The tip is pointed and has no barb; there is no hole or eye for attachment at the blunt end.



This object is strikingly similar to an object known as a fish hook, now in the British Museum (1989,0601.225), which was apparently found in the 'Batheaston' hoard of Bronze Age and Iron Age objects. The hoard was not recorded at the time of discovery, and was then dispersed by sale; the findspot is thought to be either Batheaston, near Bath, or Wylye, Wiltshire.



Because of the possibility that this object was a prehistoric fish hook, it was given an XRF analysis to determine the composition of its surface. This gave a result of 99.99 % copper and 0.01 % arsenic, which is unfortunately not diagnostic of any particular date.



It is large for a fish hook, and pure copper, being relatively soft, is perhaps not the best material for a hook intended to catch large, powerful fish. It may alternatively be a pin.","

A cast copper alloy so-called fitting of later Bronze Age or Iron Age date, similar to the so-called 'moustache-like' fittings. The object is tear-drop shaped in plan, hollow on the underside and its upper  surfaces are decorated with closely-set longitudinal grooves. The 'snout' of the object tapers and narrows in both plan and section, and gives the whole object the look of a hedgehog. It is likely that a long point protruding from the 'snout' has now broken off, as a number of similar examples on this database have long projections in this area.
","A number of objects of this type have been recorded on the PAS  database. One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998,  no.117), and as such, they are thought to date from the middle Bronze  Age to the late Iron Age. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that  they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be  confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.

The tip of the spearhead is thicker than the rest of the blade and there are re-sharpening marks around the edges of the wings. The edges of the blade has been damaged in most places. The string loops are narrow with oval central piercings. In profile they are oval

(lentoid) having a wider profile than many string looped examples. The base of the socket is broken - probably relatively recently. The socket measures 17.49mm in diameter. The side loops are 24.42mm below the end of the wings and are in good condition. The object is undecorated and had a dark black patina.



The blade facets are all lost and it has been plough rolled - probably loosing the tip of the spear as well.



The spearhead is a string loop type, which suggests later middle Bronze Age to early late Bronze Age date. Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age.

The total (incomplete) length of the axehead is  132.6mm, with the blade (from the edge to the stop) comprising 78.56mm  length and the septum/butt measuring 54mm in length. The flanges have  a maximum breadth of 20.3mm. At its widest, the blade is 44.1mm in breadth from  tip to tip.


The blade is narrow and tapering and the axe is narrow and  unlooped; The butt is broken. The axe has a well defined, rounded  stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. The side  flanges are damaged, particularly on one face where recent unpatinated damage shows that the flanges have recently broken off.  The blade is narrow and trapezoidal, widening gently to the cutting  edge, with little added flare to the tips. The blade faces of early midribbed palstaves  generally have raised edges, as if continuing the line of flanges below  the stop (see: ""The Axes of Scotland and Northern England"", Schmidt and  Burgess, 1981, p.126) but this feature is not present on the palstave  recorded here. There is no shield like depression below the  stop. The patina inside the septum is a smooth and brown layer, the butt end of which has flaked off. The butt is damaged, but looks as if it would have been rounded.

Two Bronze Age spear heads are recorded on the West Yorkshire HER from the same neighbourhood as this palstave, but they are later in date, being from the Penard (1300 BC - 1140 BC) or Wallington 1140 BC - 1020 BC) traditions.

The spearhead has a prominent central midrib which is lozenge shaped in section with a sub circular opening. The shape of the blade is, perhaps, diagnostic of side looped spearheads, probably Davis Groups 5-7. Both ends of the spear head are missing; the cutting edges and parts of the blade wings are worn and damaged; some of the material has been cracked/split and bent backwards. The spearhead has a dark orange brown patina with flecks of green throughout, shading to green and dark brown at the edges; where the tip has broken off, the material is corroded and is covered with an orange patina. It is probably either a kite-shaped or leaf-shaped spear.

The axes, which are all fragmentary, are of the South-Eastern type. Nos. 1-2 show signs of having been deliberately broken for inclusion as scrap metal. The faceted axe fragment (no. 5) belongs to a distinctive type with noticeably well-finished examples which have a very wide distribution.



1. Socketed axe fragment: South-Eastern



Double mouth moulding. Both faces have wing mouldings. Very faint transverse moulding forming hour-glass with circular pellet prominent beneath mouth moulding and very faint circular moulding between the wing mouldings at the bottom. Casting flashes visible along much of the sides, although they have been removed places. Last vestiges of mouth casting flash and of one casting jet stump visible. Ridges down the centre of the internal faces. The body has many fine transverse and oblique striations. Variable green to dark brown patina. Corrosion damage particularly on the raised areas. Straight break, blade edge missing.

The presence of axes and swords which may be interpreted as scrap, mixed with ingots of raw material, suggests that this is a founders' hoard. Although these artefacts were found as a scatter, we can be confident that it originated as a hoard and was dispersed by the action of the plough.



All of these artefacts fall within the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age period and suggest a date of deposition towards the end of the period, around 1000-800 BC.

Ingots are a well-known feature of this particular period in south-eastern England. The presence of axes, swords and spearheads which may be interpreted as scrap, mixed with ingots of raw material, suggests that this is a founders' hoard.



Although the axes are not fragmented, they do show signs of heavy wear and use and it is likely that they were collected with other surplus bronze to form a metal resource for recycling. A hoard of Bronze Age artefacts of similar types to those represented here was found in close proximity to the findspot of this group of artefacts, by David Button in January 2003 (T200310a). While it is possible that the group of artefacts reported here (T200310b), represents a separate deposit from the earlier discovery in the same field (T200310a), it is also a possibility that the two groups of artefacts originated as part of the same hoard which had been dispersed through the action of the plough.



All of these artefacts fall within the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age period and suggest a date of deposition towards the end of the period, around 1000-800 BC. The hoarding of metalwork at this period was not an uncommon phenomenon, particularly in the south-east of Britain.",4,Copper alloy,Copper alloy,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector during controlled archaeological investigation,2003-02-01T00:00:00Z,2003-02-02T00:00:00Z,2003T10B,,,,,,,20,Sally Worrell,Karen Dunford,South East,Kent,Maidstone,Hollingbourne,TQ8553,Generated from computer mapping software,51.24616687,0.64926212,KENT-757FC0,,Copy of 2003 T10.jpg,A Bronze Age hoard,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/karend1/Copy of 2003 T10.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/372489.jpg

492197,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1500,-1200,"Cast copper alloy palstave or flanged axe blade, trapezoidal in plan, rhomboidal in profile and rectangular in section, at the broken end. The opposite blade end tapers to a rounded and damaged edge in profile. The blade is broad and incurved or inturned, instead of flanged, at the cutting edge and has the remains of what might be the tip of a moulded 'V' or shield at the broken end, but this is made more pronounced by corrosion, and it does not extend any further down the centre of the blade. On the opposite face there is a large cavity near the broken edge which was probably where a large lump of corrosion product has come away from the body of the blade. This makes it difficult to see if there was similar moulding on this face. The entire surface is corroded and pitted so that decorative details are lost. The line of one casting seam is still evident down one side of the blade, but the other side is too corroded to make it out. The edges of the sides of the blade, though worn, are still slightly raised, proud of each of the faces. The palstave is missing the central flanged section with stop-ridge for the haft, any side-loop that might have once been there, and the butt end. The lack of stylistic features make it difficult to date the palstave.


Rohl & Needham (1998) illustrate an example of a palstave with a similar shape and slightly flanged blade on page 129, Fig.30, No.145, which is dated to the Taunton phase, c.1400-1275 BC.


Pearce (1983) illustrates similar 'Crediton-type' palstaves with inturned blades, straight sides with slight upraising, and V-shaped mouldings, from Perranzabuloe, Truro and Veryan in Cornwall on pages 577, 579-580, Plates 16,18-19, Nos.125, 144a & 147b.

The blade is slightly bent but seems to be almost complete. It has a mid rib on each face and the blade edges are bevelled. The sides of the blade are slightly convex, but are almost straight. At the hilt, they flare outwards and then meet to form a pointed end. A copper alloy rivet survives in the rivet hole on one side of the hilt. It is at the widest point. The other side is damaged and broken across the rivet hole. The rivet has expanded ends and is sub-circular in section.

The blade is triangular in plan and profile and the socket is sub-rectangular in section. The casting seams on the sides of the axe have been filed down but there are internal central ridges down the interior of each of the four walls which are impressions of the clay core, perhaps from fractures when it was heated.The surface of the axe is pitted and corroded in places, especially on the less complete face, but much of the original surface remains and the deep green patina survives.


Faceted axes were originally an East Anglian type, influenced by a Northern European form, but have since been found to be more prevalent further west, and in this case, likely influenced directly from Brittany (see below).

It is  unlooped with high, curved flanges (max. H. 28.2mmmm), fused to the stop  ridge. The width at the butt is 23.4mm. The  flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum  height of c. 12.6mm above the septum  (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge). The stop ridge is stands c. 8mm  above the septum. There is a shield shaped molding beyond the stop  ridge, and fused to it, on both faces (c. 19.5 by 18.0mm). This is  bisected by a molding ridge (seam) running the length of the blade on  both faces; this starts on the lower blade and  terminates before the stop. There are then four parallel ridges decorating the septum near the stop but corrosion obscures where they terminate. There are further longitudinal ridges (casting seams) central  on the sides; these have been finished by trimming the casting flash and  hammering. The blade is 57.5mm across.  The object has suffered heavy corrosion. Where it survives the patina  is dark brown; the metal is generally a mid-brown color. Spread all over the palstave are aqua colored  concretions possibly  from deposition in water.

The palstave was discovered by the finder in a collection of possessions belonging to his father, Sidney Nicholls, who was a local Archaeologist. The exact find spot for the palstave is not know.


http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axe: The term palstave is very misleading as it comes from the Icelandic  'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool not a type of axe. However the term is  used in British archeology to describe where there is a stop  and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker  below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and as time went  on developed loops.

The object has an I -section with flanges rising on three of its four sides as viewed where it has broken, a result of the uneven break. Two of the flanges, symmetrically or diagonally opposite each other, are grooved on their outer edges. The extent of patination indicates it was broken in antiquity. A hoard of two palstave axes from this parish is currently going through Treasure process, but this object comes from a distinct findspot on higher ground.

501926,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1900,-1700,"A copper alloy developed flat axe dating from the Early Bronze Age period. It is probably a Willerby style axe. It has a crescent shaped blade which is wider than the body of the axe. The original cutting egde does not survive. The body of the axe is rectangular in section and is unusually thick for a flat axe, suggesting development towards palstave forms. It does not have flanges but the edges are very slightly raised. There is no stop ridge, but the thickest part of the axe is in the centre of the body, and the change of angle forms a line where the stop ridge would develop on later axes. The sides are concave and the faces are two flat facets. The butt also tapers to a thin wedge which may have been crescentic, but is no longer complete. Much of the original surface survives which is a smooth brown patina. Where this is missing, the surface is pitted and rough, and is slightly more green. 



The axe appears to be similar to number 55 on page 125 of Rohl and Needham's BM Occasional Paper number 102 which is described as Willerby metalwork, class 4 axe. Willerby metalwork dates from 1900BC - 1700 BC.

502185,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-900,-700,"A complete cast copper-alloy transitional Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age socketed axehead (c. 900-700 BC). The axehead has a facetted body, with one wider face which widens towards the blade and a flanking narrow facet to either side. The socket mouth is round with a square internal socket and there seem to be four casting jets which are visible on the mouth, but flattened. A small collar or moulded ridge is visible directly below the socket mouth and the socket mouth itself is quite rounded on the external surface. The casting lines on either side edge have been trimmed and flattened, but not smoothed. The loop is D-shaped in plan and bears the flattened casting line on its external edge. The blade end widens from the axehead body and flares slightly at the lower blade. The colour of the metal is overall grey-green, which indicates a higher tin content; areas towards the blade end exhibit a high bronze-coloured patina. There is a small hole on one face near the blade which may be due to a casting bubble; it seems to perforate through the face and into the socket. It measures an overall 108.4 mm long, 54.86 mm maximum width at blade, 35.64 maximum outer width at socket mouth; the internal diameter of the socket is 26.9 mm and the depth of the socket is approximately 88 mm. The axehead weighs 209 grams.


Because of the socket orientation within the axehead, which is back to front, this example may be a smaller derivative of Sompting type axes.  According to Bronze Age specialist Dot Boughton, the facets indicate that this axehead should be dated to the Late Bronze Age rather than the Early Iron Age, which more typically has ribs instead of facets (pers. comm. 6/2012).","
This axehead was discovered within a short distance of Wolstonbury Hill, a well-known Bronze Age site. Within the axehead, cartridges were found which suggests perhaps that this object has been discovered previously and re-interred in nearby soil. It is therefore possible that this axehead comes directly from the Wolstonbury site. It was discovered by a Friend of Wolstonbury and reliquished to the Wolstonbury Trust for keeping as part of the collection.

502546,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-700,"Cast copper-alloy (bronze) tanged chisel of possible Middle - Late Bronze Age date (1500 - 750 BC). The identification of this object as a chisel as well as the dating criteria are rather tentative. The artefact is incomplete and poorly preserved. The metal surface is also irregular  being heavily cracked and laminated on one face and pitted  and abraded on the other - there is also a suggestion that it may have been miscast. All these elements make a positive dated identification difficult.



The chisel fragment comprises the upper part of the blade, side projections / trunnions / shouldered stop ridges, and the lower part of the tang; the tip of the tang and lower  blade / cutting edge are both lost. In plan the chisel is irregular, the upper blade is rectangular and the tang tapers to a blunted point. In section it is also irregular - the blade section is rectangular (slightly lentoid) in shape. In profile it is rectangular having its thickest part at the midpoint (corresponding with the position of the lug like projections / trunnions) tapering toward the tang and blade. The tang is incomplete and damaged; it has a relatively angular butt which expands to the mid point. It has lost approximately 1/5th of its length. The tip of the tang measures 10.6mm width and  9.1mm thick. At the mid point two irregular shaped - and relatively poorly cast - projections extend from either edge. These form shoulder like stops and are broadly triangular in plan and lentoid in section; being very crude in the casting. They are also eroded by plough roll / abrasion. The shoulder stops measure 12.7mm length are 9.4mm thick and project 6.3mm from the edge. The body of the chisel is thickest here - but there is no evidence of a stop ridge or median bevel. The upper body of the blade remains at the same thickness. It tapers slightly from the expanded stops. The long edges are of the chisel are heavily abraded and any sign of casting seams have been lost.  There is no cast or applied / punched / hammered decoration present on the artefact. It has a mid brown green coloured relatively thick patina which is abraded on all surfaces. Where abrasion has occurred some additional lamination is present, as well as distinct pock-marks and cracking of patina on both the upper and lower faces. The abraded areas are a mid - light green colour with relatively stable corrosion product present. One side is considerably uneven and irregular possibly suggesting that the chisel was poorly cast using an amalgam of metals. The break across the upper blade is patinated suggesting damage in antiquity. The surface patina on the better preserved face has a dull silver grey coloured sheen, often seen with high tin content bronzes from the very late Bronze Age and earliest Iron Age deposits (Llyn Fawr metalwork). A direct parallel has not been found for this chisel - it is much more crude then many tanged chisels of the Middle - Late Bronze Age.



The chisel measures: 72.6mm length, is 27.2mm wide across the stops and 22.6mm across the blade, and it is 11.9mm thick at the same point.

502551,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1150,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy plano-convex ingot, sub-triangular in plan and profile, and plano-convex in section. The fragment rises up from its semi-circular outer edge, which is about 10 mm in thickness, to the centre of the ingot, where it is broken, and 27 mm in thickness or height. The two sides which look deliberately waisted may have been filed after sections were taken out of the ingot, and have since worn smooth and corroded to form rounded yet defined rectangular edges. There are also a few pits in the base, side and upper surface, which were probably formed from air pockets during the casting process.


Caches of copper alloy ingots have been found in pottery vessels at sites such as Porthcothan in Cornwall, and fragments of ingots have been found in Late Bronze Age metalworker's hoards from St Erth and Tregonning, for example. These plano-convex ingots tend to date from the Late Bronze Age (c.1150-700 BC).

(from LBA  hoard)"".  The record also cites examples from Norfolk: ""examples include one from  Hockwold, one from Methwold, and two of uncertain provenance.""


NARC-F9B223 records that: ""Dr. Colin Pendleton (SCCAS) notes that there is no reason to doubt that  these are contemporary with Early Bronze Age flint examples of similar  form.""


WMID-CE6A76 cites other examples ""illustrated in Watson, P, J, 1993, 'Catalogue of  British and European Prehistoric metalwork in Birmingham City Museums',  page 11, ref no 90, found in Britain but with no provenance, as well as  page 26, ref nos 328 (found at the Swiss Lakes; no provenance); 329  (found at Lake Neuchatel) and 330 (found at the Swiss Lakes: no  provenance)""


NMS-F982A3 cites Stuart Needham, who having examined a photograph, commented:




'It is interesting to learn of yet another of these arrowheads from  British soil. Many years ago I would have doubted the veracity of the  findspot, or suspected a collector's loss, However, there are now  sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard,  Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite  the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have  to be Early Bronze Age. Bronze barbed-and-tanged arrowheads in one guise  or another continue right through and my suspicion would be that most  finds are Middle to Late Bronze Age.

506476,Armlet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Description A crumpled and torn fragment of sheet gold with engraved geometric decoration comprising three bands of double zigzags separated by two plain zones; the zones are each bounded by three longitudinal engraved lines and the edges by four. The decoration is well executed. Two straight edges are present and these appear to be parallel.

Maximum dimensions: Length 25.5mm; Width 12.2mm; Thickness 0.1mm; Weight 1.35 grams. The width when intact would be approximately 22mm.

Analysis: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of a fragment of sheet gold ornament with incised geometric decoration carried out by the British Museum's Department of Conservation and Scientific Research, indicated a gold content of 86-88%, a silver content of approximately 10-11%, the remainder being copper. The sheet fragment weighs 1.35 grams..

Identification: The parallel edges and orientation of the decoration indicate that this is not a lunula fragment. The restored width is more in keeping with an armlet. The best analogues are all copper alloy armlets belonging to Needham's Group 1 (Needham 2000, 29). These are penannular sheet metal bands, three of which are narrow and three broad. One of the former is plain but the other five have geometric decoration; the broader examples (27, 21 and 37mm) particularly bearing zones and panels of motifs resembling decoration on Beaker pottery; one of them, from Knipton in Leicestershire, was associated with a Beaker but not with human remains. Another from a Normanton barrow (Amesbury G41) was found on the arm of a skeleton (Waterman 1948, 180) but has no other associations. The Knipton Beaker is not amongst the earliest. The number of Group 1 armlets is small, and contextual information is scanty. Needham's assessment acknowledges the difficulties involved in establishing a chronology for his Groups 1 and 2 armlets. A date in the Early Bronze Age, not before circa 2200BC, appears likeliest at present.

511594,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-100,"A fragment from an unidentified cast copper-alloy object of a known type usually referred to as 'moustache-like' or 'moustache shaped'. These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead 1998; ref. 117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material. An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Robin Iles pers. comm. 9th July 2012; Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35).


The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper part. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the lower surface, which come to a halt about halfway along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminal plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end. Other hollow examples recorded on this database include: SUSS-3AEC48, WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. The opening is a maximum of 7.9mm long.


Due to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete. Based on other known examples (e.g. SF-520513) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original. The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle, with a hole through the centre of this bridge. This form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings.

The axe is of Early Bronze Age date (c. 2350 - 2050 BC). This example fits best into the earliest known copper axe and early bronze axes discovered in Britain.

515883,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-800,"An almost intact cast copper alloy socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 800 BC). The axe is almost complete with just one corner of the cutting edge (blade tip) missing. The break is patinated and worn.


The axe is sub rectangular in plan, with the cutting edge   expanding outwards to form an convex cutting edge which is wider than the rest of the axe. The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 26.51mm,  internal length 22.33mm, external  width 37.8mm, external length 34.8 mm and the wall of the mouth is 5-6mm thick). The socket is 48.72mm deep and the insides are smooth. There is a moulded collar round the mouth. On the front and back of the axe, three faint ribs extend along the socket towards the blade. There is a plain gap between the start of the ribs and the mouth moulding of about 5-6mm. The ribs fade out before the sides of the axe start to expand to form the cutting edge. There is one rib along each side of the two main faces, and one along the centre. They are rounded in section. The front and back faces of the axe are very slightly faceted at the socket end, changing in angle at the central rib. The sides of the axe have a pronounced castling seam along the centre of each. The sides are also very slightly faceted, changing in angle at the seams. These slight facets make the socket sub octagonal in section. Both sides of the axe are sub triangular in plan with the apex of the   triangle  being the point of the blade. The blade is slightly  bevelled. The collar round the mouth is 7mm wide and the corners between  the front and back and sides of the axe are rounded.


One side of the axe exhibits a semi circular moulded side  loop (18.44mm  length, 8.6mm wide, 4.4mm thick and projects 7.8mm  away from the  surface of the axe), in parallel alignment to the blade.  The loop is placed low down, the upper end emerging from immediately below the collar. A  casting seam runs the  length of the axe from the  socket mouth to the side of the blade, and over the loop. The inside of the loop  exhibits another casting seam. The casting seams do not appear to have been completely  hammered, filed and smoothed. Between the loop and the blade, nearer the loop, is a small sub-circular hole through the wall of the socket. It appears to have been formed from the outside, as the sides of the hole are angled so the hole is bigger on the outside.


The axe is a mid green to dark brown colour, with an uneven surface patina and areas of roughness.  The original surface has been removed in a couple of areas.


A very similar axe is NMS-BE9687.


Peter Reavill comments that the axe fits with the Type Yorkshire (Schmidt and Burgess), which is a very large class starting in the Wiburton /  Wallington period into the Ewart Park phase. This fits with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about  1150-750 CAL BC.
