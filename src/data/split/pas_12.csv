777234,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"Copper alloy developed flat axe of Aylesford type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981). The axe is dark yellowish brown with an even surface patina except in a few places where green patina is visible. There are a number of shallow grooves on both faces of the blade indicative of use rather than recent damage in the ploughsoil. It measures 58 mm in length but the butt is missing. The break is just behind a median bevelled stop and is patinated consistent with the rest of the axe perhaps suggesting breakage in use. Width at the crescentic cutting edge is 50.5 mm and the axe weighs 89.3 gm with a maximum thickness of 9.2 mm. It has vertically faceted sides worked into slight flanges. No evidence for decoration. It is very similar to an axe from Hutton Cranswick, East Riding, Yorkshire (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p. 61 & Plate 37, 316). The axe fits within Needham's Period 3 (MA IV) 2050-1700 CAL BC (Needham, 1996).

777635,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"A fragment of a copper alloy palstave dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age c. 1500 - 1150 BC. The fragment is sub-rectangular in shape the butt and a fragment of the flanged sides survive. The axe has anangular butt and the sides gradually widen towards the break. Both sides of the palstave have high developed flanges, which increase gradually from the butt to from sub-triangular sides. The sides are unfinished, as you can still see the ridges from the casting process.



The faces of the axe fragment are slightly concave, creating a H-shaped cross-section. The faces of the axe show signs of wear, such as scratches and the break is even and patinated, suggesting that the object was broken in antiquity. Due to the fragmentary nature of the object, it is difficult to confidently assign a Type.

777732,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1400,"A complete copper alloy palstave of the Middle Bronze Age Acton Park II period c. 1500-1400 BC. The palstave has a deep flange with upright stop; the butt of the palstave narrows slightly from the septum. Casting lines are visible on either side and there does not appear to be a side loop (unlooped palstave). The blade of the palstave flares gently outwards from the stop and although the blade tips are damaged it does not appear to have had a pronounced crescentic cutting edge. There is a narrow linear indentation on one face of the palstave on the blade below the stop which may be the remains of a shield-shaped indent; this is not repeated on the opposing face and therefore may to the result of of an imperfect mould rather than intentional. The flange is c. 77mm tall at the stop, and the back end of the palstave from the stop measures 65mm in length. The blade is 85.6mm long, 55mm wide and 3.2mm thick at the tip. The whole object is 164mm long. The palstave is suffering from bronze disease on all sufaces.



The lack of a side loop and lack of any ribs suggest it maybe relatively early and is probably of the Acton Park II period, c.1500-1400 BC. It is perhaps similar to example from Cwm Rheidol, Cardiganshire, and Arthog, Merioneth.

780686,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-900,-800,"An incomplete copper alloy Late Bronze Age spearhead (c.900-c.800 BC), missing a fragment from the rim of its socket. The spearhead has a flame-shaped blade with a stepped, bevelled edge cast into the blade. It has two cast peg holes through the centre of its socket which is conical. As the socket tapers, it forms the midrib.



The rim of the socket is broken; an old break, possibly caused by the 'ritual killing' of the spear (a common practice in the Bronze Age). The edge of the blade has suffered some erosion and there is a small dent in the midrib, but otherwise the spearhead is in perfect condition. It has a smooth, shiny, dark green patina. There is no evidence on the object to suggest that spear was used prior to deposition.



The shape of the spearhead fits into Richard Davis' Class 11a (2015) and dates to the period c.1100-c.800 BC.

The axehead is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescentic blade which tapers to a thin edge. Along the length of the axe are raised flanges and between them and nearly central is a very faint stop ridge. The flanges are bevelled both above and below the main body of the axe and may have been hammered. The butt end is narrowed and rounded and also tapers to a thin edge. Copper alloy corrosion is more prevalent on one side of the axe with the opposing surface having almost none; this would be as a result of the depositional environment.

783810,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1500,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age period, dating from c. 2000-1500 BC.



The flat axe is broadly triangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is a stunted H shape. The butt is relatively thin and appears to have a rounded top, however this has been heavily damaged; the width at the butt is 14.8 mm (thickness: 4.46 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to above the blade where the sides splay to form the blade. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (11.03 mm). The sides of the axe have a raised ridge on the outside edge of the obverse and the reverse, with a concave dip (or septum) in the centre. There also appears to be a stop ridge or proto-stop ridge at the mid point of the axe. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 39.7 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead. The axe is a mid to dark brown in colour colour, with lighter brown colours on the surface, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axe measures 89.51 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 39.7 mm, width at the butt is 14.8 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 11.03 mm (Thickness of blade: 4.5 mm, thickness of butt: 4.46 mm). It weighs 86.7 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to Aylesford Type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 60 - 61). These are the earliest of the 'developed' flat axes, and have been found along side Migdale type axes, which would suggest a similar date. These axes fit within metalworking stage IV, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Aylesford (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 26B, no 310a).

Addendum 3rd October 2016:



Seven additional objects were discovered by the same finder between 10/08/2016 and 14/09/2016. They are as follows:



30. âBugle-shapedâ object. Probable strap or harness fitting. Hollow tubular body with expanded terminals at either end. There is a narrow elongated slot on one side of the body. 21.1mm long and 5.5mm wide on one side of the body. On the opposite side of the body is a side loop, oval in section. There is a shallow groove on the body surrounding the loop. The surface has a silvery patina indicative of a high tin content. Length: 60.6mm; diameter: 11.6mm; weight: 25.8g.



31. Fragment of miscast object, possibly a palstave or chisel. Rectangular-sectioned with an old break at one end. The other end, possibly the blade end is expanded and possibly miscast. Deep cut mark across the blade end on one face and across the butt end on the other face. Length: 35.1mm; width: 28.4mm; thickness: 9.6mm, weight: 44.6g.



32. Fragment of flat-sectioned object, with on slightly curved edge. Possibly a fragment of a socketed axehead. 32.5x30.6mm. Thickness: 2.6mm. Weight: 14.5g.

35. Casting waste. Irregularly shaped. Slightly dished. One face is relatively smooth, the other is pitted. 54.9mmx34.6mm. Thickness: 10.6mm. Weight: 54.4g.



36. Penannular ring. Crushed and distorted gold lock-ring. Triangular in section and formed from three strips of sheet gold. One of the strips is undecorated. The other two faces are composed of a series of twisted gold wires fused, or possibly soldered together. Length: 36.1mm; width: 11.4mm; thickness: 4.5mm; weight: 2.7g.



Discussion: A similar object to no. 30 was recovered as part of the Late Bronze Age Eaton Hoard.","Update: a further socketed axehead was recovered from the same area in January 2018 and reported as 2018T593 (NMS-D74E8B). This was joined by seven further fragments found in November 2018 to give a total of eight items in 2018T593.



In 2022 it was realised that two more fragments of socketed axe (found October 2016) were also part of this hoard, and they have been recorded at NMS-141277 (Treasure number to come).",4,Copper alloy,Gold,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2016-03-10T00:00:00Z,2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,2016T470,,2289.5,,,,,36,Erica Darch,Erica Darch,Eastern,Norfolk,North Norfolk,Barton Turf,TG3322,,52.74536424,1.45063533,NMS-6DAFAC,,60464_6DAFAC_BA_Hoard_1.jpg,Bronze Age axe head.

783921,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1300,1000,"A Middle Bronze Age (Ornament Horizon) hoard comprising two twisted torcs and two bracelets. Neither the two torcs nor the two bracelets form matching pairs although the pairs are similar in size and form. The hoard includes two torcs of a similar form but with the main difference between them being the number of the ridges formed by twisting (Torc 1 has 43 ridges while Torc 2 has 77 ridges). The two bracelets are significantly different in colour which presumably suggests different alloys. Bracelet 1 is more extensively decorated that Bracelet 2.

The hoard was removed from the ground by the finder who reports that at a depth of two feet one torc was found with one bracelet centred within it. About two inches below this lay the other torc and bracelet similarly positioned.




Torcs

Torc 1. A twisted torc with hooked terminals and with 43 ridges formed by twisting. This torc measures 180mm across and is 10.2mm thick at its widest point. It weighs 143g. Of the two hooked terminals one is now missing (a length of about 25mm), though the break appears fresh, and the other is now detached by a break 67mm along the circumference of the torc.

Torc 2. A twisted torc with holed terminals and with 77 ridges formed by twisting. This torc measures 187mm across and is 11mm thick at its widest point. It weighs 165g. The torc is intact and complete apart from the extreme tip of one of the hooked terminals.




Bracelets

Bracelet 1. An annular bracelet weighing 224g and measuring c.87mm in diameter. The bracelet is c.12mm thick and has a narrow irregular sinuous casting groove around its outer face. This bracelet is heavily decorated with narrow incised lines. On both sides there is a band of herring bone decoration which runs centrally around the circumference. This band is interrupted by three pairs of groups of closely-spaced transverse lines which are confined to 180 degrees of the circle. Between each outer pair is a transverse band of herring bone lines, while between the central pair is a band of lines running at 90 degrees to the transverse lines. The remaining external circumference is filled with groups of closely-spaced diagonal lines which alternate in direction.

The interior face of this bracelet is plain.



Bracelet 2. An annular bracelet weighing 216g and measuring c.84mm in diameter. The bracelet is c.10.2mm thick and has a deep and irregular sinuous casting groove around its inner face and a much narrower irregular groove on its outer face. There is an area of surface loss on one side. The section is less circular than Bracelet 1 and has a flatter inner face. Decoration is confined to a central band of herring bone lines on both sides. This is interrupted at one point only by a transverse band of 17 incised lines.



Discussion: This prehistoric base metal hoard comprises more than one object and therefore should be considered Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 (as amended in 2002).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-05-13T23:00:00Z,,2016T402,,,,,,,4,David W Williams,David W Williams,South East,Hampshire,East Hampshire,Buriton,SU7621,GPS (from the finder),50.98339915,-0.91868822,SUR-9A711C,,DSC01191.JPG,Bronze Age: Hoard,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSC01191.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/567947.jpg

Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in plan and lozenge in section with mid-ribs. The tip of the hollow socket can be seen and is approximately 10.1mm in depth.



An insufficient portion of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.

784257,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1750,"Copper alloy developed flat axe of miniature form or possibly a chisel of early Bronze age date (2050- 1750 BC). The axe is possibly of Type Bandon, Variant Swinton but it is smaller that so far known examples. The object resembles a miniature version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads. The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow sub-rounded butt and parallel slightly tapering sides which expand to the cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly convex (bowed). In profile and cross section the axehead is lentoid. The patina has broken away leaving a red-brown corroded and pitted surface.



Miniature flat axes such as this tends to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC.



The length is 80mm, the width is 20mm and the thickness 17mm.



The axe is of a diminutive size, if it is a Type Bandon, Variant Swinton and it remains unclear whether the axe had a practical purpose or was votive. It is possible that the 'axe' may have been used for delicate tasks, perhaps similar to a chisel. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.

785246,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-950,"An incomplete copper alloy (bronze) palstave axe with side loop of the Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1050 - c. BC 950.



The blade of the palstave is sub-oval or tongue shaped in plan. The cutting edge measures 34 mm in width and is 6.7 mm thick. The blade is blunt and has been heavily damaged, no cutting edge is visible. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The object measures 27.4 mm in width and 28.4 mm thick at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge the axe has been decorated with two diagonal raised ridges or ribs, forming a triangle, with a vertical ridge in between, on one face of the object. The opposite face, shows evidence of similar decoration below the stop ridge and evidence of a raised mid rib in the centre of the axe.



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is broadly rectangular in plan and broadly triangular in profile, in section it appears as a squashed (or stunted) H shape. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The butt end measures 24.3 mm in width and is 5.9 mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is a broad U shape and measures 61.9 mm in length. The septum is 5.8 mm deep at the stop ridge and the sides have a depth of 3.7 mm. The flanges may have been misscast or more likely have been lost due to abrasion. The remaining edge is rough and undulating. The side loop measures 27.8 mm in length externally and is 8.6 mm in length internally. It is oval in plan and the arms are broadly circular in section.The loop is situated with one arm level with the stop ridge and the other below. There are no visible casting seems.



The object measures 134.8 mm in length, is 34.4 mm wide.It has a maximum thickness of 28.3 mm and weighs 327.9 g.



The object is a mid brown to green in colour and has an uneven patina. There is evidence of bright green copper corrosion on the surface of the axehead.On the front of the object, on the right are traces of the original gold coloured patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



This object is similar to the Type Nettleham axeheads illustrated in Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), plate 67, no 930, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 - BC 950.

785872,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1200,"An incomplete copper alloy Low Flanged Palstave Type axehead probably of the Middle Bronze Age period, dating to c. BC 1300 - c. BC 1200



The blade of the palstave is broadly rectangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex blade edge. The cutting edge has been lost and the blade has been damaged extensively. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade has a width at the blade edge of 40.5 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 5.14 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 19.7 mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 28.32 mm). Beneath the stop-ridge, on the front side of the palstave, is what appears to be a tapering central faceted rib. This rib is incomplete as much of the patina has been lost. The convex cutting edge of the blade is lost through corrosion, abrasion and probably wear. The exposed edge is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This may be due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion. 

The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 4.30 mm deep at the stop ridge and the flange facets are approximately 3.13 mm deep, and is an elongated U shape in plan. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The width at the butt is 24.12 mm, the butt has a thickness of 5.84 mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. However, both faces of the axe have been severly damaged by abrasion and corrosion which renders comparison between the two faces difficult. The flange facets on both sides have been severly damaged, the edges are incomplete. 



The palstave measures 123.3 mm in length and has a width of 31.3 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 20.1 mm and weighs 297.7 g.



The palstave is a light - mid green colour with areas of thick well formed patina and exposed areas of abraded metal. It is likely that abrasion and corrosion has spread and affected over 75% of the surface of the axe. This corrosion seems to be relatively unstable at present and areas of light green active powdery corrosion can be observed. The majority of the abrasion present on the palstave is located on one face. There is an area of the original gold coloured patina on the surface on the base at the right hand side of the reverse. A similar example of this type of Palstave can be seen in Schmidt and Burgess (1981) plate 58, numbers 792 - 801, and has been identified as a Low Flanged Palstave. However it is difficult to be certain of this due to the exent of the corrosion on the surface of this object. This form and style of palstave fits into Group II or III (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981) which is dated to the Middle Bronze Age 1300-1200 BC. Other similar examples have also been recorded on the database, including HESH-D05FE3 and HESH-D98157.

786938,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1100,"A fragment of a copper-alloy axehead, Palstave or Flanged Type, of the Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1900 - BC 1100.



Only the tip of the blade and a small portion of the body of the axehead survive. No traces of a socket remain in the break of the axe, indicating that it is probably not a socketed axe from the later Bronze Age. The object is broadly D shaped in plan and rectangular in section. The blade is flares out from the sides of the object and is crescent shaped at the base. The sides of the object taper out to form a wide V shape. These both perhaps suggest that the axehead is either a flanged or palstave type. The cutting edge is highly abraded, and there is no evidence of a blade facet. The break is heavily patinated which would suggest that it is an ancient one and not the result of recent plough damage.



The incomplete axehead measures 29.3 mm long, 52.4 mm wide at the blade, and 37.7 mm wide at the broken end It has a thickness of 3.01 mm at the blade and is 9.2 mm thick at the broken end. It weighs 51.8 grams.



The object is a dark green in colour with an uneven patina. There are areas of lighter green corrosion, however it appears that the corrosion is stable.

787044,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1140,"An incomplete Bronze Age copper alloy barbed-and-tanged arrowhead or razer, dating circa 1275-1140 BC.



Other than the tang, the original perimeter of the arrowhead is heavily abraded or entirely missing. The present perimeter does, however, indicate that the sides were gently curved towards the tip, rather than being straight. A v-shaped notch separates the wings from the tang. The tang is rectangular in section, and measures 4mm x 1mm. A shallow midrib is visible on one side only. The midrib extends from the tang, being of the same width, and gently tapers towards the tip. The surface of the arrowhead is mid-brown and pitted, with patches of dark brown patina.



Length: 20mm, Width: 16mm, Thickness: 1.2mm, Weight: 1.79g.



There is only one bronze arrowhead from a secure Bronze Age context in Britain and that was in the Penard hoard, first reported in Archaeologica 71, page 138. The Penard arrowhead also has a mid rib. At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import as there are numerous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France.



However, thanks to an increase in the number of reported metal detected finds, Bronze Age bronze arrowheads are now growing in number, though they remain a rare group of artefact. Dr Colin Pendleton reports that Suffolk has 17 known examples, of which 5 can be termed barbed and tanged. Norfolk has at least 4 recorded and more examples are being added to the database from around the country. This suggests that bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition.



Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age to the Middle Bronze Age, the evidence from Penard, which dates from 1275-1140 BC, suggests that copper alloy arrowheads did not come into fashion until later in the Middle Bronze Age. Therefore this is the suggested date range for this arrowhead.

787086,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1150,-1000,"A hoard of 929 fragments of copper-alloy plate and their container of likely Late Bronze Age date, c. 1150 - 800BC, possibly of the Wilburton phase (c.1150-1000BC).



Description: The hoard consists of 929 fragments of copper-alloy 'plate'. These pieces range in size from 9mm x 6mm to 58mm x 41mm and are highly irregular. No element can clearly be identifed as coming from either a bun ingot, typical of the period or clearly definet object types. It is noted however that all the fragments are small enough to easily be added to a crucible for remelting. While most of the edges of the fragments appear to be breaks or relatively rough some 'natural' rounded edges are noted, likely from their inital produciton and thus suggest an orignal shape/size. All Fragments are patinated green and a number have fused together. The fragment sin total weighed 12559g.



These fragments were contianed within a medium sized hand made ceramic vessel, missing the rim and upper body (possibly because of plough truncation) and of an unidentified Bronze Age type. The ceramic fabric is of a silty-sandy matrix, with a fair fine flint temper and some larger sparser inclusions of irregular quartzite. The surface appears to have been finished in some manner reflecting possible smoothing on the inside. The upper section of the vessel appear to be relativelly thin and thickens substantial to the base. The diameter of the body of the pot is suggestee to be 210mm and survies to a height of 160mm.



Discussion:



The plates found at Preston show some similarities to another hoard recorded in Kent, the 2012 treasure case report and excavation at Lyminge (2012 T164). At Lyminge, amongst other LBA/Early Iron Age a total of around 380 copper alloy 'ingot plates' were found. Although at the time they lacked a parallel both in the immediate area and in continental Europe, we can note clear similarities between this hoard found at Preston and the case found at Lyminge. In both examples the plates appear in large numbers, they are of varying form and are suggestive of fracture or fragmentation as opposed to neat cutting. They are visually similar although the Lyminge pieces appear to be generally larger.



In regards the Lyminge hoard, the lack of similarity to existing forms of Bronze Age metalwork, differences in composition and the difficulty of dating the plates led to questioning of the Bronze Age date ultimately given. The secure placement of copper alloy pieces in a Bronze Age vessel at Preston strongly supports the assessment that these pieces reflect a Bronze Age date and use, possibly the same as that at Preston. Although no complete vessels were found at Lyminge, there were numerous pottery sherds likely contemporaneous with the plates. It is possible although not certain that the pieces may have been stored in these vessels as is the case at Preston.



While Lyminge is the most direct comparison we can draw to this hoard, there are several other sites which may possess similar examples of plate scrap, albeit in more limited forms and on a smaller scale. A treasure case (2014 T60) found near Bramfield in Suffolk for example possessed 28 copper-alloy fragments of plate-scrap 'ingot' of ""varying size and thickness"". While the pieces are identified as ingot fragments in the report, we can note far more similarity to the smaller pieces of plate found in this treasure case. The pieces of alloy are smaller than many ingots (all below 50mm) but are also crucially far thinner with depth generally between 2 and 5mm. The rectangular shape present on most of the pieces is also arguably similar to the treasure case in question. Similarly a treasure case hoard (2008T589) found at Broxted, Essex possessed a large and homogenous plate assemblage of 31 pieces. These pieces were more or less flat, they range in thickness from 2.5 to 6.3 millimetres and possessed an ""average thickness of 3.5 millimetres"". Although these plates are as a whole larger than those found in the Preston hoard and as such could show more similarity to Ingot, they still show some basic similarities. In this Essex treasure case several natural edges are present possessing curved outlines, something that can similarly be noted at the edges of the Preston hoard.



The unpublished Waldershare hoard from Dover Museum is possibly the most similar example. This hoard assemblage contained 341 fragments of bronze sword blades found in and around a flint tempered clay pot. While they have been identified as sword fragment (Weller, 2014), many of the pieces do not appear to reflect a traditional sword form and instead show similarities to the plate present in this treasure case. The presence of a vessel is also notable suggesting a connection between these two plate scrap hoards. Waldershare (Likely the general area of the hoard) is within 15 miles of both Lyminge and Preston and as such could represent links between the findspots.



Date and Wider context



The Late Bronze Age (LBA) has been generally noted as the most abundant period in terms of hoards with large numbers being deposited. Notably, very few of these assemblages in Kent contain obvious prestige items, instead the LBA as a whole contains a prevalence of ingots and cast waste (Weller, 2014). These pieces often found in founders hoards are widely interpreted as refuse material waiting to be recycled and used again (BrÃ¼ck, 2002). The hoards are often extremely large with hundreds of pieces not uncommon.



This case fits well into such a pattern with the size of the pieces being supportive of their use in a crucible. The identification of other treasure cases containing potential pieces of plate scrap as Wilburton can assist with our assignment of this case to the LBA period. The pieces found with LBA material such as the axe at Lyminge may further support this assessment.



The ceramic vessel as noted suggests a range of dates, in both cases the LBA is mentioned as a possibility (1150 - 800 BC) and this is possibly in keeping with other plate scrap sites. The possibility it is either MBA (1500-1150 BC) or Early Iron Age (800-600 BC) can still be noted, however.



Nearby archaeological sites of interest show a range of archaeological features within 500m of the site. Neolithic activity in the North West is present but likely unrelated to this site. Iron Age settlement activity is also present, spreading to a ring ditch, finds of early Roman pottery in this area may suggest this may be too late in date although a long occupation is possible. A multi-phase Bronze Age settlement is also present to the immediate South West of the find as well as a Late Bronze Age axe hoard found within a mile. Whether these sites are related to the hoard is unclear but they can be noted as possible parts of a wider LBA or EIA landscape (Jackson & Ahmet, 2016).



Deposition 



Some inferences can be made from the total weight of the pieces, taken together they weigh over 12kg (12.559kg) and as such are potentially too heavy to be lifted in the pot in which they were contained. The weight is possibly suggestive that the pieces have been only placed in the vessel for deposition and were not being carried in it regularly. The weight also gives us some insight into the significant amount being removed from circulation, the need to store the volume of bronze for future use may explain the deposition in a single pot. The weight of the pieces shows few obvious parallels, the site of Sittingbourne is one clear example containing 13.6kg of amorphous tin-bronze fragments.



Conclusion 



The 929 pieces of plate metal and the ceramic vessel in which they were deposited represent a single find, all or part of which appears to have been deposited in a Bronze Age ceramic vessel. The metal fragments show clear similarities to several other later prehistoric cases in the area with the potential of sharing wider metallurgical activity with the site of Lyminge. Considering this evidence, the objects described above represent a single find of more than two base metal objects of prehistoric date, and therefore qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002)","We are grateful to Nigel Macpherson-Grant for his observations and thoughts on the ceramic vessel of this hoard.



Due to the substantial nature of this hoard and time restraints a sample of the fragments are photographed and shown here. Further pictures of the fragments and the container will hopefully be forthcoming.

The axe is near-complete with peripheral damage but is heavily corroded and with a fragmentary butt (with a length of 164mm and a weight of 157.8g). The fractured butt has a rounded point and is thin (6mm wide and 2mm thick) but has suffered some erosion. The sides are moderately straight and divergent to the side protrusions or trunnions (giving the tool a width of 30.5mm). The corroded trunnions are rounded and of oval form (11mm long, 7mm wide and 3.0mm high). Below the trunnions, the sides of the blade are also straight and gently divergent before curving more sharply at the blade edge, although the blade tips are lost (with a surviving blade width of 34.5mm). The surface corrosion has mostly eradicated any casting seams, although there is the suggestion of a fettled seam on one side near the trunnion but no suggestion of a loop. The faces are of differing form, one is flanged, the other is ribbed and of chisel-like form. The flanged face has a median bevel (87mm from the blade where the adze has a thickness of 11.7mm) and short flanges, spanning the bevel (25mm long and 3.6mm high giving a maximum overall depth of 15.6mm). The blade is without any ribs and is flat across both its length and width and with no discernible blade facet. The other face is without flanges and the slightly domed curvature appears to incorporate the trunnions. There is the suggestion of a transverse moulding, running between the trunnions. The face has a prominent midrib, beginning well above the trunnions (35mm from the butt) and continuing along the blade (ending 26mm from the blade edge). The face is convex across its width but flat across its length, with no discernible blade facet. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted. Remnants of the surface with a dark-green patina is preserved, largely on the septum of the flanged side.



The tool is unusual and difficult to closely parallel. The side trunnions and ribbed face can be broadly paralleled with 'Trunnion Tools', while the flanged face is best paralleled with flanged axes, perhaps closer to slender axes of Later Short-Flanged type. The tool may have been hafted with the handle abutting the flanged face and with binding over the ribbed face, rather than within a split handle, in the way flanged axes were secured. The method of hafting may imply the blade would be perpendicular to the axe direction suggesting the tool functioned as an adze. The tool may share similarities in form with 'palstave adzes', as published by Evans (1881, p. 85, gigs 70-1) and with recent examples recorded with PAS from Gisburn, Lancashire , Swithland, Leicestershire , Crosby Ravensworth, Cumbria , Brokenborough, Wiltshire and Tanworth-in-Arden, Warwickshire . It is tempting to see this example as a 'flanged-adze' predecessor of the palstave adze. Trunnion Tools have a long-lived production, spanning the Arreton Tradition at the end of the Early Bronze Age and continue into the Late Bronze Age (c. 1700- 800BC). If the flanged face is referencing and contemporary with axes of Later Short-Flanged type it is possible to suggest a date spanning Later Acton Park or Taunton metalworking, dating to perhaps c. 1500 - 1300BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-04-27T23:00:00Z,,,,157.8,15.6,,11.7,164,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Llantrisant,ST0486,From a paper map,51.56467611,-3.386377,NMGW-DABBEA,,2015100.jpg,Middle Bronze Age 'flanged-adze',The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2015100.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/568831.jpg
787156,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1100,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze rapier of Group IV and possibly of Type Appleby, variant Lakenheath (as defined by Burgess & Gerloff 1981, p. 74-6) but possibly with a reworked butt and of Penard metalworking Industry

The rapier is near-complete, with some damage to the shoulders and butt (with an overall length of 328mm and a weight of 94.3g). The butt end is arched and rounded (with a width of 20.3mm and a thickness of 1.6mm) with two side notches to accommodate rivets beneath (with a depth of 3.5mm and 2.8mm, giving a minimum width of 14.3mm at 10mm beneath the top of the butt). The shoulders are weak and poorly defined, with the butt widening very gradually and linearly to the shoulders (to reach a maximum width of 24.0mm, 27mm beneath the top of the butt, where the blade has a thickness of 4.1mm). The blade has a gentle curve beneath the shoulders to narrow slightly (to a width of 20mm). Below which, the blade is moderately straight and gradually convergent to the before narrowing more sharply at the tip. The blade has a flattened central section (8mm wide at the butt) which gradually narrows to a ridge at the tip. The blade edge is largely preserved and does not appear to have any contemporary nicks or blade edge damage. The upper half of the edge appears slightly wasted, possibly through use or sharpening. There are no sharpening striations now evident on the edge. The surface has a brown to black patina with some sandy encrustation, mostly on the lower half.



The blade profile would suggest a Group IV blade, the reduced butt may suggest Type Appleby and the rounded butt and rivet notches, would further refine the type to Variant Lakenheath, although illustrated examples with notches by Burgess and Gerloff (ibid.) are reworked. The poor definition of the shoulders together with the flat mid-section continuing above the notches may also indicate that the butt has been reworked. Very few Group IV rapiers had been recorded from Wales (from the 1981) study but a Type Appleby rapier was recovered from the Maentwrog Hoard (Gwynedd) with two other Group IV rapiers (Type Cutts, Variant Hampton Court and a blade with notched butt) and a basal looped spearhead. Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p 106) note that Group IV blades (without 'archaic' butts do not tend to be associated with Taunton metalwork and appear to start in Early Penard and Wallington, suggesting a date of c. 1300 - 1100BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,94.3,,,1.6,328,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Gwynedd,Gwynedd,Tudweiliog,SH2237,,52.90088368,-4.64791389,NMGW-DBE3D3,,20152531.jpg,Bronze Age rapier,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/20152531.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/568837.jpg

788407,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2125,-1950,"Small cast copper alloy flat axe with a narrow butt end and a slightly flanged blade, dating from the Early Bronze Age. The butt end is 21 mm wide and 3 mm thick and the blade end is 52 mm wide and 3 mm thick, and the length of the whole axe is only 113.5 mm. The edge of the blade of the axe appears to be unused, and the size of the axe suggests that it might have been used for votive reasons. Analysing the content of the metal might help to confirm this, but it is from a private collection. The colour suggests that the axe is copper-rich and the original surface survives well, with small patches of corrosion product and a few pits, and a few marks on one face of the blade. Otherwise the axe is in very good condition. Flat axes with narrow butt ends with rectangular sections and slightly flanged blades can be found during the Brithdir metalwork phase (c.2150-2000 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 123, fig.24, no.34). Plain axes like this are also classified as Type Migdale which belong to 'Metalworking Assemblage III', corresponding to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 2 (c.2300-2050 BC).

Below the decoration, the blade has been hammered and bevelled. The edge of the blade is damaged and parts of the surface are pitted with corrosion, but the dark green patina survives well and the axe has been treated and lacquered in the past so that it is now stable.

Both faces of the axe are decorated with multiple straight lines punched into the axe after casting, on average about 6 mm in length, and about 1 mm apart, in what is referred to as a 'rain pattern'. The decoration covers an area between the stop ridge, which is 70 mm from the edge of the blade, and about 20 mm from where the blade chamfers and angles down towards the cutting edge, which is about 18 mm in depth. The cutting edge is asymmetrically worn, suggesting extensive use, and the material displacement on one side represents damage from use (Matt Knight pers comm). The corners of the crescentic blade are at right angles to the side of the axe. The surface patina of the axe is good with little evidence of corrosion and the axe has been treated and lacquered and is now stable. Flat axes decorated with this 'rain pattern' and with crescentic blades can be found during the Willerby metalwork phase, dating from c.1875-1725 BC (Roberts et al, 2013, 23, fig.2.2) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 4 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 125, fig.26, no.53).

The axehead is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with an extended crescentic blade where the corners turn back on themselves. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The stop ridge is 4 mm thick and 20 mm wide and 62 mm from the butt end and 72 mm from the blade edge. There are thirteen oblique ridges on each side flange of the axe, which range in length up to 20 mm long and are each about 7 mm apart. There are some patches of green corrosion product but the surface of the axe has survived well and its general condition is very good. Flat axes with flanges decorated with oblique ridges and crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig. 28, no.87).

The socket mouth is 27 mm long and 17 mm wide, which is quite unusual. The collar is 10 mm deep with a side loop on one side of the axe, 5 mm below the collar. The side loop is 18 mm long with an aperture that is 6 mm in diameter. Above and below the side loop there is a casting seam which continues down the side of the axe and which is also on the other side, but has been chiselled flat, apart from a slight ridge above the side loop. There are minor facets down the sides of the blade faces. The blade has turned-up corners, so that the side edges of the blade are almost at right angles to the body of the axe. There are some patches of green corrosion product on the surface, but the axe has been treated in the past and is now stable. Socketed axes with rectangular socket mouths, plain collars and crescentic blades can be found during the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1275 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age.

The everted collar is 7 mm deep and about 10 mm below the everted collar is a transverse moulding, from which five parallel vertical ribs extend down the blade at right angles, on each face. Two of the longitudinal ribs form a border on either side where the axe is chamfered at a sharp angle. The ribs are 2 mm thick, 40 mm long and 6 mm apart. The side loop extends from the transverse moulding down the side of the axe to a length of 24 mm with an aperture that is 10 mm in diameter. The casting seam is evident above the side loop and above the transverse moulding on the other side of the axe, but the rest of the two seams that continue down the sides of the axe have been chiselled flat. The blade has slightly expanded corners, and the edge is undamaged, suggesting that the axe may not have been used. There are file marks on one face of the blade, where an area of corrosion has been filed away since its recovery, and it is away from the edge so that this is not a contemporary re-working of the blade, and the cutting edge has not been re-sharpened. Otherwise the axe is in very good condition with only a few patches of corrosion.

The septum measures 17 mm wide and the stop is 72 mm down the length of the septum and 10 mm deep. There is a shield-shaped moulding with a curved base below the stop, measuring 23 mm in width and 30 mm in length down the blade. At either side of the axehead as the flange tops slope downwards after the stop, there is a transverse ridge that has been chiselled away after casting. The length of the blade from the end of the shield-shaped pattern to the edge of the blade facet measures 55 mm and the blade then slopes downwards to the cutting edge, which is 16 mm in depth. The blade splays outwards nearer the edge to form a semi-circular shape with one of the blade corners having been flattened since deposition, probably through damage. The cutting edge is still quite sharp and has been broadly hammered out initially, followed by finer hammering close to the edge, creating two bevels (Matt Knight pers comm). There is some corrosion on the blade and only patches of the dark green surface patina survive. The casting seam has been chiselled flat on either side of the axe and continues down the overall length of the flange and the blade side as a thin line. Palstaves with shield-shaped decoration and expanded blades can be found during the Acton Park II metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) of the Middle Bronze, such as the palstave illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 128, fig.29, no.92).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar palstave with shield-shaped moulding from Openshaw in plate 57, no.783, which is classified as a primary shield pattern palstave and dated from the Acton metalwork phase.

788681,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1125,"Cast copper alloy mid-ribbed palstave or axehead with flanged sides with a side loop attached beside a deep curved stop and a crescentic blade with a large central longitudinal rib, dating from the Middle Bronze Age. The side loop is 29 mm long and has an aperture that is 9 mm in diameter. The casting seam above the loop as been chiselled away, but there is still a raised lozenge-shaped lump, and the rest of the seam on both sides has been chiselled flat. The stop is 18 mm wide and 10 mm deep on both sides and the thickness of the flanges together, front and back, is 30 mm so the start of the blade beyond the stop is about 10 mm thick. The blade is 21 mm wide below the stop and expands into a crescent which is 63 mm wide and 2 mm thick at the cutting edge. The mid rib is 7 mm wide and 62 mm long, and is accentuated by two parallel grooves, one on either side of the rib, that are 5 mm wide and 62 mm long. There are multiple oblique scratches above the stop and between the flanges on one side, which have probably been caused by scraping old varnish or lacquer off the surface with something metallic, since its recovery and re-sale. Other than these, there are very few marks on the axe and little corrosion, and the blade is only damaged slightly at either corner, which has not happened through use, but more likely since deposition. Mid-ribbed palstaves with crescentic blades and side-loops can be found during the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1275 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age, with broad crescentic cutting edges with tips at right angles to the blade, but the narrow body and low flanges rising to the stop ridge of this palstave are indicative of a transitional type which could date from the following Penard metalwork phase (c.1275-1125 BC) (Matt Knight pers comm).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar palstave with a side loop, a broad mid-rib and a crescentic blade from Barskeoch Moss in plate 61, no.832, which is classified as a Type Carleton, Variant Kirkcowan, low-flanged, side-looped, mid-ribbed palstave and compared to items produced during the Ornament Horizon of the later Middle Bronze Age such as a palstave in the Taunton hoard (c.1400-1275 BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,"In a private collection, recorded for academic use",Other chance find,1980-05-31T23:00:00Z,1989-05-31T23:00:00Z,,,387.2,,,30,153,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,East Midlands,Nottinghamshire,Bassetlaw,Cuckney,SK5671,Centred on village (which isn't a parish),53.23309192,-1.16250295,CORN-7DBCCC,,June16finds187.JPG,side-looped palstave (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/June16finds187.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/573139.jpg

There were also in the same find spot 2 sherds of pottery both Roman, 1 fragment of vitrified glass one lithic implement probably a microlith. The Roman finds are invasive and therefore do not form part of the treasure case likewise the microlith is likely to be Mesolithic and residual. All were discovered together in a pit with large sub-rectangular sandstones some of which were utilised to weigh down the objects.



At the bottom of the pit were three spearheads all laid out in a line with two large heavy rings adjacent to the left. One of the socketed axes was between two sandstones. Then armrings and two wrist torcs were sandwiched between two socketed axe heads underneath and was another socketed axe head on top a socketed chisel.



Mixed in the soil of the deposition were a number of finds. A wood fragment was recovered measuring in length 52mm, with a width of 15mm, thicknessof 6mm and weighing 2.96g, it could relate to the hafting of one of the axes or spears. Also discovered with the deposition were two fragments of pottery one a creamy fabric with a shell temper measuring 30mm in length, 25mm in width, is 11mm thick and weighing 12.61g. The fabric is slightly soft with a powdery surface. It is an off-white colour and has a fine texture. The sherd was probably made at Mancetter, Warwickshire. Mortaria from Mancetter dates to the 2nd to 4th centuries (Tyers 1996). The sherd is slightly abraded and is only a fragment of the complete vessel. The other sherd measuring 39mm in length, 27mm in width, is 8mm thick and weighng 12.70g probably a sherd of Roman Black Burnished ware dating to the period c. AD 43 - 410. Possibly from a WA Type 20 ""dog-dish"" (Seagar-Smith 1993). The fabric is a black with a shell temper. Also discovered was a fragment of Roman vitirified glass measuring in length 20mm, width 8mm, thickness 4mm and weighing 2.0g. The glass is severely affected by extreme burning and is now vitrified. The fragment is irregularly shaped and exhibits a series of breaks. A further find of a lithic implement microlith was also discovered which is probably residual measuring in length, 11mm with a width of 4mm, thickness 2mm and weighing 0.19g. Probably a Mesolithic microlith barb of honey coloured flint dating to between c8000 amd c4000 BC. These finds are probably residual or invasive do not form part of this treasure case.



Also from the field but 40m away is a palstave axe previously found in 1990 now in Lancaster City Museum. The deposition appears to have been in the side of a large burnt mound around 10m in diameter. On the other side of the canal, a socketed axe is also on the database and a palstave 200m away on the same side of the canal as the deposition.



The metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).



The copper alloy artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases, dating to between 1100-800BC (Needham et al 1997). It is intended to attempt to ascertain radiocarbon dates for the deposition of the hoard and undertake an investigation into the find spot.



â



1. Copper alloy socketed axe



The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, very chipped and jagged, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in recent and ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.



The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 28mm, internal length 32mm, external width 39mm, external length 42mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).



A moulded collar decorates the axe 8mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 31mm in length. The ribs are worn. The front and back faces of the axe are very slightly faceted at the socket end.



Along the centre of each side of the axe is a pronounced casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 14mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.



The axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125).



Axes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).



Length: 83mm, Width: 50mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 181.06g.



2. Copper alloy socketed axe



The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is crescentic, chipped and jagged in the centre although the rest of the blade is in good condition. The cutting edge measures 58mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.



The socket has a square mouth (internal width 26mm, internal length 26mm, external width 38mm, external length 38mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).



A moulded collar decorates the axe 22mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are two fluted ridges measuring 54mm in length.



Along the sides of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have not been filed down and are off centre to the left. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 14mm in width and 22mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam does not run over the side loop. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The axe closely resembles the Type Portree, variant Alford as identified by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, 188-190 and Plates 75 and 76).



Length: 90mm. Width: 59mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 260.64g.



3. Complete copper alloy spearhead



The spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.



Length: 152mm. Width: 44mm. Thickness socket: 24mm and the weight: 131.28g.



4. Cast copper alloy socketed axe complete and in good condition.



The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, chipped and jagged at the corners, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.



The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 25mm, internal length 28mm, external width 37mm, external length 40mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).



A very worn moulded collar decorates the axe 15mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 32mm in length. The ribs are worn.



Along the centre of each side of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded very narrow side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.



The axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125). Axes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).



A fragment of a pressed flower was discovered in the bottom of the socket presumably for attachment. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



Length: 86mm; the blade width is 50mm. Thickness socket: 26mm and the weight is 219.14g.



5. Copper alloy socketed chisel or unlooped socketed axe



The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 25mm, external width 28mm, external length 32mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).



On the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away and are almost invisible. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The blade is crescentic in good condition. The cutting edge measures 54mm in width and is 1.0mm thick. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (57mm wide) which appear to have been deliberately recessed.



The socketed axe is unlooped, making it highly unusual and very rare. There are no comparable axes in the corpus of axes covering northern Britain by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and neither are there comparable socketed chisels in the corpus of woodworking tools in southern England by Lee (2014). However, Eogan (2000, 215-16 and Plate 111) highlights the few examples found in Ireland with one parallel with the provenance only of ""County Armagh"" being the closest (No. U15).



Length: 110mm, Width: 53mm, Thickness socket: 25mm, Weight: 152.07g



6.Copper alloy spearhead



The spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in fine condition with blades still sharp and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.



Length: 150mm. Width: 43mm; Thickness socket: 20mm and weight 130.79g.



7. Complete copper alloy axe



The socketed axe is slender and faceted in form with a collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade. The mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The socket has a sub circular mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 24mm, external width 29mm, external length 31mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).



The mouth of the axe tapers and the loop is relatively small in a low position set well beneath the collar. Directly above the loop is a cast decorative circumferential ridge and above this on one face of the axe is a peg hole 4mm in diameter there may have been another on the other face but this area is covered with corrosion. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section.



On the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (50mm wide). The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away bur is still visible on and at the base of the side loop. The cutting edge is crescent shaped edge and regular suggesting little evidence of wear / sustained use. Apart from the groove below the collar there is no evidence of other ornamentation on the axe.



Inside the axe a complete pressed flower was inserted possibly a type of thistle.



Length: 97mm. Width: 52mm; blade: Thickness socket: 24mm and weight 148.01g.



The socketed axe can be classified as Type Meldreth (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204-211 and Plate 82). It is closely comparable to axes found singly at Knotty Ash, Lancashire (No. 1226), Newham, Northumberland (No. 1227) and Pendle Hill, Lancashire (No. 1229).



8. Copper alloy penannular bracelet



The bracelet has expanded oval-shaped terminals. The body is broken in one place. The surface has a green patina.



There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).



Diameter: 60mm. Thickness: 8mm. Terminals diameter: 9mm and weight 20.33g.



9. Copper alloy penannular bracelet



The penannular bracelet has two expanded oval-shaped terminals. It is in two fragments with one fragment missing that would have joined the terminal fragment to the body of the bracelet. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).



Diameter: 54mm. Thickness: 4mm. Terminals length 5mm, width 2mm and weight 6.89g.



10. Copper alloy spearhead



The spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 116-123 and Plates 75-77) as Group 11: Generic Type 11E Short, splayed socket.



Length: 123mm. Width: 46mm; blade: Thickness socket: 23mm and weight 91.86g.



11. Copper alloy annular armring



The annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. This armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.

13. Copper alloy annular ring



The annular ring is circular in shape and has a lozenge-shaped cross section. There are three defined circumferential ridges running parallel around one section of the ring.



The three circumferential ridges as well as the form of the ring are comparable to the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron of Class A1 (Type Tul-na-cross) and Class B1 (Types Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg) (Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g)., or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire. Similar rings have been recorded from the Hindon hoard (PAS WILT-9439A7).



The form of the annular rings - though not the decoration - are also closely paralleled in copper alloy horse gear, most notably at Horsehope Manor, Peebleshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 146, nos. 3-9) and Monmore, Killin, Perthshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 141, no. 6).

17. Wood fragment, hazel nut shells and a pressed flower



Discovered within the deposition they relate to deposition containers and possibly the hafting of one of the axes or spears.



Length: 52mm. Width 15mm: Thickness 6mm and the weight 2.96g.



The insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard, Suffolk (PAS SF-BDA986) is comparable to the to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park metalwork phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).



Discussion



With the exception of the 2 Roman ceramic sherds, the vitrified glass and the flint microlith, which is probably of an earlier Mesolithic date, the objects listed above belong to a single deposit, dating to the Late Bronze Age (Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases c. 1100-800 BC) and, on the balance of probabilities, should be treated as a single find of more than two objects of prehistoric copper alloy. Whilst all of the individual object types have been found in northern Britain, it is the quantity and diversity of objects in the Late Bronze Age hoard from Scotforth, Lancashire makes it a distinctive and rare discovery. The insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. It is however extremely rare, if not unique, to discover inserted pressed flowers. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in other hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard is comparable to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).



Conclusion



Consequently, these finds qualify as Treasure under the 2002 Amendment to the Treasure Act of 1996 (Category 2), which stipulates that any group of two or more metallic objects of any composition of any prehistoric date that come from the same find and found after 1 January 2003, qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act.

The object is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is missing due to an old and abraded break however the retained portion tapers inward toward the butt end. The retained portion of the body of the object has a diagonal break, possibly cause post-depositionally.   



The metal is brown in colour with areas of light green corrosion. The object has a pitted patina.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.

794162,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been circular in plan and plano-convex in profile, but this fragment is triangular in plan and plano-convex in section and in profile, as it comes from one edge of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face of the ingot is smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and coppery red areas of decay, and light green powdering which is bronze disease. The sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.



Pearce (1983) illustrates similar ingots with rectangular profiles from Mountbatten, Plymouth on page 451, plate 36, nos.281t, which were found with other Late Bronze Age metalwork, and an ingot fragment from Churston Ferrers, Torbay on page 457, plate 40, no.306b, which was found with a larger plano-convex ingot, no.306a.

794194,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-700,"Cast copper alloy blade fragment, probably from something with a similar curvature like a sickle or razor, but only the sickle has a wider outer curved edge tapering towards the internal cutting edge. This fragment cannot be part of an axe blade or a razor blade as they taper towards the curved cutting edge and not towards the broken inner edge. It may look very like an axe blade fragment in plan, but the profile shows that it is not. But the cutting edge is missing so that any identification cannot be proven.



See NMS-0B76C3 for a similar sickle blade fragment, which is dated from the Late Bronze Age, and has worn as this piece has to create a skin-like patina layer, with lighter green corroded edges.



Pearce (1983) illustrates two sickles from the Taunton hoard with a similar curvature in plan and taper in profile on page 651, pl.90, nos.752u-v, which are dated from the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age, c.1400-1250 BC.

794463,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Incomplete copper alloy Late Bronze Age socketed axehead dating from c. 1000-800BC. The axehead is a South Eastern type and part of the Ewart Park metalworking assemblage. It has a round section socket and is undecorated except for a single moulded ridge around the socket apeture. There is a single integrally cast loop on the underside of the axehead and a casting seam that runs the length of the object from blade to socket on the upper side. The blade of the axe has been damaged and there are patches of corrosion across the surface. The axehead is triangular in plan, tapering to the blade which is flaired and so wider than the socket end. The object has a dark olive green/brown patina except in the places where the corrosion has occurred and it is a light green.

794518,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-2350,410,"Bronze Age (-2350 to 410) to Roman flat axe: The axe is made from cast copper alloy. The axe is an elongated triangle, with rounded terminals. In profile the butt is tapers in thickness towards its edge. The thickest portion, in profile, is the point between the blade and butt. The blade, in profile tapers to a blunt, rounded edge. The axe is slightly asymmetrical in the centre and at the blade edge.



The surface of the axe has a well-developed light green-brown coloured patina.



The axe measures 48.05mm in length, 21.24mm in width, 6.95mm thickness and weighs 24.0g.



The date of the axe is not certain. Flat axes initially date to the early Bronze Age, c. 2000 to 1600 BC, but do tend to be larger and have a facetted edge if it were used, for example WAW-049216. It is possibly this example is a model or miniature axe as the blade does not appear to be functional, unless it has been over used. Votive axes are known from the Roman period, such as DOR-8BF889. The surface condition may suggest the axe is dating to the Bronze Age rather than the Roman period, but as it is not certain a wide date range will be given.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-05-09T23:00:00Z,2015-05-09T23:00:00Z,,,24,,,6.95,48.05,1,Angie Bolton,Carina Hughes,East Midlands,Leicestershire,North West Leicestershire,Ellistown and Battleflat,SK4311,From finder,52.6949811,-1.36519162,WAW-E3F2D5,,WAWE3F2D5.jpg,"Bronze Age to Roman flat axe (plan, profile and reverse).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWE3F2D5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/590999.jpg

The axe has a clean break parallel with the blade and 4.5 cm above the tip of the blade.



There is a darker area of casting in the centre of the break which may be indicative of the bottom of the socket having been just above that break. Perhaps it may also be due to some form of deferential cooling of the core. It may be possibility that it is a fragment from an earlier form of palstave axe. That would take the date back to around 1500 BC.

795779,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-800,-700,"Late Bronze Age date (c. 800 - 700 BC) socketed hammer: The cast copper alloy hammer has a rectangular mouth on the interior edge of the socket, but the exterior edge is a sub-oval. The upper edge of the mouth is damaged and incomplete, but the damage is not recent as the patina matches the side faces. The mouth, on the exterior, has a high-relief lip and high-relief band below the lip. Co-joined to the band along the edge there is a high-relief elongated triangle platform as decoration on each wide face. The interior of the mouth measures 10.96mm long and 7.73mm wide and the socket is 26.82mm deep. There is no residual material present inside the socket and the socket is slightly angled compared to the exterior edge of the mouth. The hammer, when viewed in plan, is rectangular below the band, and towards the terminal flares outwards slightly, is also slightly obliquely angled through use and is slightly convex. This terminal, when viewed from the base, is rectangular with rounded terminals. Along the sides there is a trace of a casting seam along the length of the hammer but some finishing has occurred as the seam is rounded. The surface of the hammer has an incomplete mid brown matte patina which has a slight shiny greyness to it where it has been more recently scuffed, otherwise it is abraded.



The hammer measures 51.95mm in length, 23.11mm in width, 19.34mm thickness and weighs 84.3g.



Hammers often have a higher tin content in the bronze (Evans; 1881) compared to contemporary axes. It has not been possible to metallurgically analyse this example but on the record for NMGW-475C27, a comparable example in dimensions and weight to this hammer, the recorder comments the weight may suggest a high proportion of lead, rather than tin.



The Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website (https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/hammers) comments that the ""socketed hammer is only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976: 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA' With regard to decoration, they are found with or without a single rib band, and in the case of a few hoards in Britanny, some hammers were found with chevron decoration."" Another example on the PAS database with decoration to this example is NMGW-475C27.



The YORYM-ABCCE1 record for another hammer discusses the dating of socketed hammers stating that 'early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding'. With this in mind and the potential high proportion of lead, the Worcestershire hammer probably dates to the Late Bronze Age possibly dating to the Ewart-Park Phase (c. 800 - 700 BC), a phase characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts.



Bronze Age socketed hammers are not frequently reported, with just over 40 certain examples recorded on the PAS database at the time of writing (August 2016), including CAM-5B410A, SOM-B048D1, YORYM-86F1B4, DEV-A7DFBD, SF-40FAAD, YORYM-ABCCE1, FAKL-9C9543, LVPL-5A7954, SWYOR-D13642, NMGW-475C27, LVPL766, LVPL1167, NMS1243, SF-2CF092, LVPL-89D1D3, LVPL-89D1D3, LVPL-5A7954, LVPL-5A6D83, IOW-A05DE6, HAMP-8CB626, NARC-F543D2, HAMP-2CB8E2, NMS-23EF85, SUSS-2D5992, SF-50F922, NMS-4D3FD2, LANCUM-2C7E41, HAMP-1F3730, BH-5A09F0, SF-86C4F5, IOW-8B13A7, SF-B89096, WAW-75FD95, NMGW-46A3A3, SF-F4C804, SOM-9AAFF3, LON-80850F, NMS-9B7964, NMS-03BA13, IOW-B9E2E2, and KENT-FDBC44.



This hammer and WAW-75FD95 are the only two examples on the PAS database from the West Midlands at the time of writing. The distribution for these axes on the PAS database tend to be below a line stretching from the north Norfolk coast across to St.David's in Wales and above a line stretching through Crewe to Hull. There is a narrow band across the Midlands which is, at the moment, devoid of these hammers on the database.

795784,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-800,"Bronze Age (c. 950 to 800 BC) socketed axe: The blade portion of the copper alloy axe remains with the broken edge traversing the axe revealing a short portion of the socket. The blade has straight sides and only slightly flared blade tips. The cutting edge is blunt, and is slightly convex. The casting seam is visible on the sides, forming a slight triangular profile. One face of the axe has three parallel ribs visible, the other face has traces of these ribs, but they are not as clear. The socket is rectangular with rounded corners, but is off-centre therefore making the wall on one face very thin.



The surface of the axe has been over cleaned and has what are through to be recent scratches across the surface. There are two small patches of a heavy dark brown coloured patina, whereas the remaining surface is a mottled mid to dark green and brown colour. Despite the over-cleaning the axe is in a stable condition.



The axe measures 48.38mm in length, 41.79mm in width and 16.05mm at the thickest point, and weighs 93.5g.



The axe dates to the Ewart Park phase, and, due to the three parallel ribs extending to the blade face, is possibly a South Welsh or South Western type dating to c. 950 - 800 BC. Similarly decorated axes are illustrated in Savory (1980, Figure 25).

In section the spearhead is has a sub-circular tube with short, abraded triangular facets, one on opposite sides which are the abraded blades. The tip is missing and here the spear is a sub-square in section. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is circular. The break at this point is not recent. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has traces of a dark green patina, otherwise the surface is pitted and heavily abraded. 



The spearhead measures 42.78mm in length, 6.40mm in width, and weighs 7.8g.



It is likely that the spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150BC).

On the exterior surface there is a trace of a side loop, the loop on the other side is completely missing. There is a fragment of the blade on either side of the socket, but the upper edge is broken, and this break is not recent, but the surface of the break does not have the same patina as the outer surface of the spear. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has a dark shiny brown coloured patina.

The ring consists of a single copper alloy bar, oval in cross-section which has been coiled to create the finger ring. It now has one complete loop and two incomplete loops. It appears to be complete, although both terminals exhibt traces of damage. The ring has a smooth dark green patina, with occasional pitting.



This example is similar to a number of coiled rings found in a Middle Bronze Age hoard found in Sussex, recorded under SUSS-C5D042. Similar rings have been found in the Mecklenburg area of North Germany suggesting close associations with the Continent. A brief period in the Middle Bronze Age is marked by the occurrence, in hoards, of tools and bronze ornaments which owe their inspiration to types current in north Germany and Scandinavia from c.1400 BC. These include torcs, coiled finger rings, ribbed bracelets, knobbed sickles, and square-mouthed socketed axes. This influx seems to have given a boost to the native bronze industry.

798508,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1150,"A hoard of 10 copper alloy palstave axeheads, found in one spot, described as 'one hole' and therefore possibly a pit deposit. The artefacts have been numbered 1-10 for the following catalogue.



Description:



1) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy axehead in good condition, with corrosion of the surface visible. Requires further conservation to remove the remaining soil. The butt is slightly damaged, with a small chip missing from one corner. The flanges start to rise gradually, in a convex curve from the butt, fusing to the stop bar at the maximum height above the septum. The body of the axe is narrow and expands into a triangular blade which flares slightly. The cutting edge is relatively complete except for small pockets of corrosion damage along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is asymmetrical which suggests use and possible resharpening, with one blade tip slightly rounded. Both faces are corroded but a small sub-triangular depression below the stop bar, surrounded by a raised triangle can be seen, notwithstanding the corrosion and remaining soil.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 67mm, axe length: 167mm, stop bar width: 23mm, flange width at stop bar: 31mm, butt width: min 16mm, weight: 506g.





2) Palstave axehead. A complete Palstave axehead in two sections, broken diagonally below the butt. Corrosion is visible over the surface with growths on one blade surface.  The cross section across the break reveals a U-shaped septum. The flanges rise from the butt end to the stop bar which is raised. Parts of the flanges are damaged (on one side more so) due to corrosion. The separate butt end is asymmetrical in shape, with one corner quite rounded and the other irregular due to damage, suggesting a degree or wear prior to further corrosion-related damage. Both faces of the break reveal a pitted interior to the metal, which may have caused this area of weakness leading to a break. Casting seams are visible along both sides of the body of the axe, which appear to have been polished off the blade edges closer to the cutting edge. The blade is slightly asymmetrical which suggests some degree of wear along with rounded blade tips. A sub-triangular depression is identifiable beneath the stop bar on each face. On one face a linear depression extends from this area, which could indicate ancient damage. Other marks are found on both faces and the cutting edge but could relate to corrosion or the recovery of the artefacts.



Dimensions -



Blade width:71mm, section 1 length (butt): 34.5mm, section 2 length (axe body): 134mm, axe length (total): 168.5mm, stop bar width: 20.5mm, flange width at stop bar: 31mm, butt width: min 16mm, weight (section 1): 45g, weight (section 2): 414g, weight (total): 459g.





3) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead, with surface corrosion visible, and some soil remaining on the item, therefore requiring some conservation. The butt is slightly rounded would could suggest some wear. Triangular flanges, with slight corrosion-related damage, rise from the butt end to the stop bar which is the point of maximum height above the septum. Below the septum is a hollow, just visible on both faces but obscured by dried earth and corrosion. The narrow body of the butt end expands into a triangular blade with a slight flare of the blade tips. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical with some recent damage to the corroded metal edge. There are a few small hollows visible on the blade surface and within the septum which could be a result of impurities in the cast metal or as a result of corrosion.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 75mm, axe length: 176mm, stop bar width: 25mm, flange width at stop bar: 28mm, butt width: 20mm, weight: 475g.





4) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy palstave axehead. The butt is damaged in the centre, the flanges rise from here to the stop bar giving a convex side profile. Below the stop bar is a depression with a raised shield design, consisting of three raised linear lines contained within a raised shield outline. The design appears on both faces. The blade is triangular but flares on one side towards the blade tip, the corresponding tip has no flare but is also damaged and corroded - this tip is also the lower side of the asymmetrical cutting edge. There are chips along the cutting edge which could be a mixture of ancient damage and metal corrosion, but a sharpened blade facet is visible beneath the corrosion and dried earth.



Dimensions -



Blade width:66.5mm, axe length: 162.5mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 31mm, butt width: 16.5mm (damaged), weight: 456g.





5) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy axehead with surface corrosion. One face appears to be in a better condition than the reverse side. The butt is damaged in the centre, with one corner also missing - this damage appears to be ancient. The flanges rise in a slight convex curve towards the stop bar. Beneath the stop bar appears to be a small depression in a sub-triangular shape at the top of the blade face. The blade itself expands into a triangular shaped blade with slight flaring towards the blade tips. The cutting edge appears quite straight suggesting wear in the central section.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 71mm, axe length: 173mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 26mm, butt width: 19mm (damaged), weight: 478g.





6) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead. The axe has a square butt end, with flanges rising in a convex fashion towards the stop bar from c.2cm from the butt. The body and butt end of the axe is narrow before expanding out into a crinoline blade. On both faces the blade facet can be seen as a result of sharpening the cutting edge. The cutting edge itself is almost complete with small areas of damage (probably due to corrosion). Beneath the stop bar is a small sub-triangular depression. It may be possible to see usewear marks on the cutting edge once the axe has been conserved.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 70mm, axe length: 173mm, stop bar width: 21mm, flange width at stop bar:, butt width: 20mm, weight: 444g.





7) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead in good condition apart from areas of surface corrosion, particularly on the lower half of the blade. The butt end is slightly damaged on one corner, possibly in antiquity. The flanges rise from the butt end to the stop bar, creating a triangular side profile. The blade is triangular with an asymmetrical cutting edge, although there is little damage to the blade itself. One blade tip is missing, and apart from this small area of damage and the slight damage to the butt, the axe is complete. A clear raised triangular design sits beneath the stop bar, consisting of two raised linear bands with a central depression, the design is visible on both axe faces.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 68mm, axe length: 181mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 32mm, butt width: 18mm, weight: 503g.





8) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead. The butt is damaged slightly but largely complete, and flanges rise towards the stop bar creating a slightly convex side profile. Beneath the stop bar is a sub-triangular indentation, visible on both blade faces. The blade itself expands and flares outwards towards the blade tips. The cutting edge is damaged with a number of chips along its length, some modern and possibly occurring during recovery, others perhaps ancient and prior to deposition. A blade facet is visible on both sides, showing sharpening had occurred to shape the cutting edge.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 74.5mm, axe length: 178mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 27mm, butt width: 20mm, weight: 491g.





9) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead, with no signs of physical damage other than that related to corrosion. The butt is square, with flanges rising from the butt end to the stop bar, creating a triangular side profile. The blade is triangular, and flares slightly towards the blade tips. The blade side appears to be rounded. Below the stop bar a small sub-triangular depression is visible on one face, whereas on the reverse face the depression would appear more circular in shape. The surface of the blade shows evidence of corrosion, but the cutting edge is complete apart from some corrosion-related flaking.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 71mm, axe length: 181mm, stop bar width: 25mm, flange width at stop bar: mm, butt width: 20mm, weight: 529g.





10) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy axehead. The axe shows evidence of corrosion, particularly on the lower half of the blade face. The butt is square with some damage to the corners and the centre. The flange side profile is triangular, with nicks prominent along the line of the stop bar. The casting seam is also visible along the flange sides on the butt end of the axe. The blade is triangular but flares towards the blade tips, one of which is missing, and appears to have been damaged in antiquity. The cutting edge is asymmetrical but largely complete suggesting it was resharpened in antiquity. The design beneath the stop bar is a small triangular depression, surrounded by anther incised triangular design, creating the illusion of a raised triangle. This is particularly clear on one face, however the reverse face is likely to be of a similar design, but is obscured through remaining earth and corrosion.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 68mm, axe length: 177mm, stop bar width: 24mm, flange width at stop bar: 27mm, butt width: 18mm, weight: 480g.







Identification/discussion: 



The axeheads described above (Nos.1-10) are all identifiable as palstave axeheads which belonging to the Middle Bronze Age period (c.1400-1150 cal BC). The axes within this hoard all suffer with surface corrosion obscuring the original surface of the blade, making usewear analysis difficult;





The palstaves Nos. 1-3, 5-6 & 8-9, are comparable to those placed within Rowlands 'class 3 group 1' including a similar axe surviving in a hoard from Goudhurst, Kent (see Rowlands 1976: pl 2 (85) no.3, and p. 247). Rowlands class 3 are characterised by a U-shaped septum profile, low triangular or slightly convex flanges, a straight sided triangular or crinoline blade and a triangular depression or ribbed motif beneath the stop bar (Rowlands 1976: 32-33). Group 1 and 2 within class 3 are divided based on blade width, being 7-8cm and 5-6cm respectively, placing the above axes between the two, but probably within group 1. Using the PAS Palstave Guide these examples would be categorised as 'group 2' ('early palstaves' https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/axes [accessed 12/10/17]). A number of the axes within this hoard which sit within this category have blades which slightly flare towards the blade tips and are not purely triangular in shape. Axes Nos.1,2,5-6 & 8 all have identifiable sub-triangular motifs, whereas axes Nos.3 & 9 are slightly different in how clear the motif is. No.9 has one side which appears to be a more circular depression in comparison to the reverse side motif.





Axe No.10 has an unusual triangular design, which is difficult to identify. This axe is directly comparable with axe No.1& 5 from 2017 T459, with the clear triangular design and axe size being almost identical, apart from the direction of curve of the blade sides. Examples with similar designs can be found in O'Connor 1980, which includes a looped Palstave with similar v-shaped ornamentation from the Gable Head Hoard (O'Connor 1980: p321-2, Fig.6 No.25), and a broken Palstave with V-ornament from the Marshall Estate Hoard, Sussex (O'Connor 1980, p.328, Fig.14, No12). Although similar in design, these published examples are not quite identical. Axe No.7 is similar in that there appears to be a raised triangular design, however there is no corresponding outer incised line.





Axe No.4 has a clear shield design, composed of a raised shield outline with 3 linear ribs within, running in the direction of the axe.  A comparable example is an axe from Lower Swanwick, a hoard of four palstaves buried in a pit (Rowlands 1976: 240). Axe 1 from this site has a similar shield design below the stop bar (see Rowlands 1976: p7, (63) no.1), which Rowalds' identifies as a Class 3 Group 1 palstave (1976: 240). A further example is found within the Birchington hoard - a collection of fourteen palstaves found within an urn (Rowlands 1976: 246; pl.10 (82) no.10)). Along with palstaves Nos. 1-3, 5-6 & 8-9, No.4 can be considered a 'Birchington Type' palstave (Rowlands 1976: 32-3).





A similar hoard of palstave was also found in the immediate vicinity by the same finder at a later date (see 2017 T459 - KENT-593613). The number (ten) of the palstaves found in the hoard is comparable to those found in 2017 T459, which was found only a short distance away. Furthermore, they appear to have been deposited in similar manners: as a group deposit in a pit. Axes Nos. 1-3, 5-6 & 8-9 are comparable to eight of the axes found within hoard 2017 T459, and axe No. 10 is comparable to axe no.1 from hoard 2017 T459.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,2016T618,,,,,,,10,Jennifer Jackson,Jennifer Jackson,South East,Kent,Thanet,Manston,TR3467,GPS (from the finder),51.35385881,1.35933957,KENT-495597,,2016T618_10_view1.JPG,Palstave Axe 10 view 1,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/2016T618_10_view1.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/635029.jpg
798710,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy Mid to Late Bronze-Age dagger blade. It consists of a small fragment of the hilt, with the remnants of two rivet holes, with apparently most of the blade. It is sub lense shaped in cross section, with a slightly emphasised central rib on both sides of the blade and tear drop shape in form, tapering to a rounded point. It is difficult to be certain how much, if any, of the blade is missing. It is 67.88mm in length, 28.00mm in width at its widest and weighs 13.55g.The surface has a dark green patina and shows abraded patches. This dagger is perhaps typical of the Penard phase of the Bronze Age (1275 BC to c. 1140 BC). It is very similar to a Grp III rapier, or more likely, a dirk.

The axe head is trapezoidal in shape with a curved broad butt and blade. There is no significant flare to the blade end. The axe had a lenticular cross-section and has signs of wear to both the blade and butt ends. The butt end is 17.7 x 2.6 mm, that widens to 33.58 x 3.37 at the blade. The axe head appears to be of a broad butt type, probably a 'Migdale' type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44).

799061,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-1500,"A cast copper alloy flat axe dating to the Early-Mid Bronze Age (2350 - 1500 BC). The axe is narrow with straight but tapering sides and there are no signs of a stop ridge. The sides of the axe are very slightly thickened, but it does not have flanges.



The metal is dark green in colour with a heavily pitted and corroded patina.



Length: 99.47mm, Width: 35.8mm, Thickness (blade): 2.91mm, Thickness (Mid-section): 9.08mm, Weight: 151.8g.



The axe probably fits into the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC, or slightly later.

The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There is damge to both edges of the blade.



It measures 56.3 mm in length, 13.9 mm wide (base), 5.4 mm wide (tip) and 6.5mm thick. It weighs 9.7 g.



The spear head is a mid green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. This object has lost most of it's diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult. However similar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including SWYOR-1F74C1, SF-C557DC and WMID-270D2F.

The axe is heavily eroded and has breaks across the butt and the side loop. The blade gently flares to the cutting edge; the sides are straight, and in section the blade is rectangular. The cutting edge is abraded and appears to have been reground several times owing to the lack of expanded blade at the edges.The axe has a pronouced stop-ridge on both sides, though on one side it is damaged. Two moulded ridges run away from the stop-ridge down the blade on both sides. These ridges are difficult to see on the side that has suffered the greatest damage. The butt is incomplete.



The surface of the axe is variable. Towards the cutting edge the blade on both sides has a smooth surface with green-brown patina. It is heavily pitted towards the stop-ridge on one side. The butt is heavily pitted on both sides.



The length of the axe is 125mm, and the height across the blade is 39mm. At the stop ridge it is 25mm in height, and 24mm in width.

One side of the chisel has broken away to reveal the socket within, which is 36 mm long and 12 mm wide, but the upper mouth of the socket is missing. The chisel is corroded and pitted but there appears to be no active bronze disease. The blade has a curved edge which is worn, and fragments of the edge have been broken off in the past, but it appears to mainly follow the original edge with no flaring of the tips. There are small scars on both faces that are probably the result of plough damage. The hollow interior is cone-shaped, with the socket ending 20 mm up from the blade. The cross-section of the chisel is sub-rectangular with the walls ranging from 2 to 3 mm in thickness. The chisel is missing its butt end and was probably about 70-80 mm in length originally. The shape and curve of the blade suggest that this might have been a tool for carving wood, with the rounded edge enabling the carver to work with a concave area. The angle of the bevel, at about 20Â°, would have made it ideal for fine work where thin slivers of wood were being removed.

802317,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-850,"A complete cast copper-alloy tanged chisel of Late Bronze Age date. The chisel is in good copndition and appears undamaged, with evidence for use wear on the blade tip and edge. The chisel has a tapering square-sectioned tang, 6.66mm thick, which abutts the round-sectioned, collared handle stop of the chisel blade. The collar is 11.7mm diameter. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in profile and expands to a very thin cutting edge with slightly flared shoulders. The cutting edge is 33.2mm wide. The object is in very good coniditon and has a mid-brown patina across much of its surface.



Tanged chisels, which date from c. 1150-850 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds; complete examples from such contexts are uncommon. Several tanged chisels, or elements of them, are recorded on this database (for example, see BH-49EAD8). Two other complete tanged chisels from Oxfordshire are of almost identical form; on this database an example from South Oxfordshire (see BERK-52E8C3), and another illustrated in Evans (1881:168 no. 193) from Wallingford (formerly Berkshire).

802377,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-2050,"An incomplete copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of the Early Bronze Age, dating from c. BC 2500 - BC 2050



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid in shape. The butt is relatively thin having a flat edge, the butt has been broken. The patina at the break matches with the rest of the axe suggesting the break occurred in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge). However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.5 mm). The sides of the blade expand slightly to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 62.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. The blade facet has been heavily abraded and is virtually no longer visible, however the top and bottom of the blade do slope gently down to the edge. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. 



The object measures 86.2 mm in length. The width at the butt is 45.4 mm, the centre is 51.5 mm wide and the blade is 62.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 6.9 mm, the centre is 9.5 mm thick and the blade is 5.3 mm thick. The axehead weighs 252.1 g. 



The axe is a mid to dark brown in colour with a much abraded or corroded patina. Traces of a light green patina, suggesting corrosion products. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of most of the original surface detail. 



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age (or possibly even the Copper Age). This example fits best into the copper axes and early bronze axes. The form of the axe is comparable to Type Castletown Roche/Pitlochry (outlined by Schmidt and Burgess p 22-23, Plate 1, No 5). These axes fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Similar axeheads have also been recorded on the database including HESH-ACD6C1, HESH-84D8A5 and LANCUM-AA5ED7.

803218,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Two pieces of an incomplete copper-alloy late Bronze Age sword, dating to the period c.1100-800 BC. The two pieces fit together to form a blade that expands outwards from its pointed terminal before narrowing again. Worn breaks are present where the point has broken off, at the line of impact where the two pieces have separated and at the terminal which would have been closest to the grip. Corrosion is present in patches over the surface on both sides and the edges are very worn. The sword has a wide central ridge down its length and a lozengiform cross section which narrows in thickness towards the point. A brown and green patina is present on the surface.



Although most of the diagnostic features have been lost, the 'tongue-like' form of the blade suggests an Ewart Park or Wilburton type (Dot Boughton and Peter Reavill pers comm).

803236,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Incomplete cast copper alloy long-flanged axehead with a crescentic blade that has worn to rounded terminals, dating from the Early Bronze Age. The blade is trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the broken edge. The blade is incomplete and would have expanded to a crescent shape with pointed ends orginally. The blade narrows towards the broken end, which is below where the transverse stop ridge would have been, stopping the haft or handle from sliding down the blade when the axe was being used. There are seven transverse ridges and grooves surviving on one of the faces of the axe, between the flanges and above the crescentic blade, which range in length from 18 mm to 32 mm and are each about 4 mm wide. The surface of both faces is very pitted and there are patches of green corrosion product within some of these pits. 



Flanged axes decorated with transverse grooves and crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig.28, no.87).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar flanged axe with wide transverse grooves on the blade from Staxton in North Yorkshire in plate 33, no.411, which is classified as a Type Arreton long flanged axe and dated from the Arreton metalwork phase.



An example of a local Arreton flanged axe with the area above the crescentic blade decorated with incised transverse bands is illustrated in Pearce (1983) on page 615, pl.54, no.427.



The Arreton metalwork phase now dates from c.1700-1500 BC (Matt Knight pers comm).","Report by Matt Knight:



This is the lower blade of a small axe with the remains of low flanges extending onto the blade and an expanding crescentic cutting edge. There are four transverse grooves separated by five ridges on one face, spread between the flanges close to the break. There are the faint remains of the same decoration on the opposite face. These range in length from 8-32mm and are each about 4mm wide. It has been suggested these are destructive but the regular spacing and fine nature suggests they were decorative. The axe has broken below any possible transverse bevel so it is difficult to definitely identify, but the overall form of the axe is suggestive of Needham's Class 5, dating to the Arreton period.



Due to the corroded nature, it is difficult to identify definite signs of preparation and use. It is likely that the flanges were hammered up and the cutting edge had been worked to shape. The ridge and grooves are consistently patinated indicating these were deliberate decoration.



The axe has broken unevenly in antiquity across the middle of the blade, through the flanges. The break is consistently patinated/corroded and there are at least two macroscopic casting inclusions present in the break, which would have influenced the breakage. The ridge and grooves are situated very close to the break, raising the possibility that this was a deliberately destructive act, with the grooves representing failed strikes. However, it is more likely that the axe may have broken while incising the decoration.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-07-24T23:00:00Z,2016-07-24T23:00:00Z,,,103.4,,,11,58,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Madron,SW4733,From finder,50.1429742,-5.54236741,CORN-183F23,,Sep16finds060.JPG,flanged axe (decorated face),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Sep16finds060.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/582245.jpg

The pin has a globular head with flat, indented top. Below the head is a slightly swollen collar decorated with two circumferential lines of simple incised linear scores of shirt length, arrange vertically around the pin. The shaft of the pin then tapers slowly with a sub-circular section into the almost rectangular terminal, which appears to be missing the very tip. The pin has been bent round and is now penannular; this may have been purposeful and reused as a bracelet. The pin does have similarities with an example of Cool's (1990:170) Class 24 pins of probably second century AD date, however identations on pin heads are seen throughout the Iron Age too. This pin does share similarities to Early and Middle Iron Age 'cup-headed pins' however examples of this period display a deeper cup than seen on the example recorded here. The patina, head style and otherwise simple form and decoration of this pin does suggest an early date - possibly Middle Bronze Age (1400-1250 BC) through to the Middle Iron Age (to c. 400 BC).","Picardy type pins are dated from the early Taunton phase of the Bronze Age and according to the most recent interpretations probably go out of use by the Renard phase, giving a date range of between c.1400 and 1250 BC (Roberts, 2007: 141).

This axehead is broadly sub-rectangular with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt is narrow and rounded and measures 22mm in width and is 3.4mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than cast flanges .The expanded blade measures 43.64mm in width and is 2.4mm thick.



The axe is in good condition although there is some damage to the blade. The object has a green patina and the surface is slightly pitted. A small area of the original cutting surface survives on the central part of the blade but there is some damage towards the peripheries of the cutting edge. The sides of the axe are raised, with distinct but very low flanges extending from the base of the blade to near the butt. There is no evidence of casting seams which would indicate that the axehead has been reworked after casting to produce the raised flanges.



The axehead measures 96.19mm in length, 43.64mm in width (at the blade) is 11.4mm thick and weighs 131.04g.



In HESH-3AFE67 Peter Reavill comments that the axehead is best described as coming from the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 420, 423and 413).

805523,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of five objects.



1. Palstave butt end fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 24.7mm; butt width 23.5mm; max. thickness at break 11.2mm; surviving weight 25.9g.



Small butt end fragment of palstave. In side view, the flanges reach the septum approximately 14mm below the butt end and there is some concavity and change of angle in the upper profile. The butt end is wide and angular, with a slightly convex curved top. On both faces of the upper septum, repeated scratch marks are evident and these look relatively recent. The break appears to have occurred in antiquity. The fragment has a dark grey green patination.



2. Palstave butt end fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 29.7mm; butt width 21.3mm; max. thickness at break 11.8mm; surviving weight 26.8g.



Small butt end fragment of a palstave. In side view, the flanges reach the septum approximately 17mm below the butt end and there is little concavity and change of angle in the upper profile. The butt end tapers noticeably in plan view to approximately 21.3mm. There is some damage to the end profile, although it would appear that the butt end had a slightly convex curved top profile. The break appears to have been made in antiquity. The fragment has a light grey green patination with some surface pitting and corrosion evident.



3. Small blade fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 32.7mm; width at breaks 16.5mm & 17.5mm; max. thickness 4.8mm; surviving weight 10.4g.



Small and narrow blade fragment, whose blade has a rounded centre-section. The blade sides are slightly concave. In side view, there is slight bending of the blade near the upper blade break, suggesting forcible breaking of the blade. Some areas of original blade face surfaces have been eroded, while blade edges have pale green powdering. The break surfaces are worn, suggesting the blade was broken in antiquity. The blade fragment has a green-brown patina.



4. Spearhead lower blade fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 33.0mm; max. surviving width at lower break 26.2mm; maximum thickness at lower break 10.9mm; aperture diameter at lower break 7.5mm; surviving weight 20.7g.



Small lower blade fragment of a spearhead with a rounded midrib. The wide midrib tapers significantly from approximately13mm at lower break to approximately 10mm at the upper break, indicating it is a lower blade fragment. In side-section, there is an oval shaped hollow up the central midrib of the blade (7.6mm wide at lower break and 5.2mm wide at upper break). The blade margins and edges have been eroded away and are absent. In side view, there is pronounced bending towards the upper break, suggesting forcible breaking of the spearhead. Near the lower break on one face, there is a flattening and slight dent, suggesting breakage through impact with an implement of unknown form. The break surfaces are worn, suggesting the spearhead was broken in antiquity. One face is differentially eroded and pitted, with a pale green patina, while the reverse has greater survival of original surfaces and has a dark grey-green patina. The eroded edges are pale green and powdery.



5. Flat plate fragment



Dimensions: Maximum length 23.7mm; maximum width 21.4mm; thickness 4.0mm; surviving weight 8.8g.



Small flat plate fragment. One edge has a bevelled margin, as if it was deliberately shaped and was an upper surface. Very slight, almost imperceptible concavity of the reverse side suggests it may have been an interior surface. On both surfaces, there are slight linear and irregular shaped surface blemishes, showing as slight negative depressions. These are probable irregularities created during the casting process. The break edges of the plate are eroded, suggesting breakage in antiquity. The plate fragment has a dark grey-green patina.



Discussion (by Adam Gwilt)



The two palstave butt fragments (Nos. 1 & 2) may be identified with confidence as either belonging to Transitional palstaves of Middle Bronze Age date or Late palstaves of Late Bronze Age date. The chief discriminating feature between the butts of these two forms is in the shape of the side flange profile. With Transitional palstaves, flanges are highest at the stop and they typically extend in a straight line from stop to butt, to give an elongated lozenge form (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 145-6). Late palstaves, by contrast have short flanges, curving and descending to meet the septum well below the butt (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 158). The distinction however is one of degree: some later Transitional palstaves do have flanges reaching the septum well below the butt, with some concave curvature in the slope evident (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 146). On these two small butt fragments, a clear typological distinction is difficult to make, since both have side flanges which meet the septum some distance below the butt and hinting at a concavity of slope, rather than in a straight line. The wide and square end of one palstave fragment (No. 1) is a tendency more typically viewed on Late palstaves (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, Plates 66-7), however some Transitional palstaves also exhibit similar characteristics. On this morphological evidence, it is difficult to differentiate between later examples of Transitional palstaves or Late palstaves.



The presence of small but deliberately added quantities of lead (1-5%) to the composition of these palstaves is instructive. Metallurgical analysis of Transitional palstaves from Wales and The Marches has indicated a general pattern of unleaded bronze compositions with trace presences (less than 0.1%) of lead in some (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 451-86). By contrast, analyses of Late palstaves from Wales and The Marches show leaded bronze compositions with a range of 1.0-17.5% lead added, and frequently in the range of 1-6% (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 496-545). On this metallurgical evidence, the two palstave butt fragments from Penllyn are consistent with Late palstave compositions and, on a balance of probability, are probably fragments of Late palstaves rather than Transitional palstaves.



Late palstaves were made during the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age and spanning from 1150 to 800 BC (e.g. Savory 1980, 47; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 162-3; Northover unpublished a, 212, 270, 274-7; Davies & Lynch 2000, 180-7 & Fig. 4.15). In Wales, Late palstaves were included within the Guilsfield hoard of late Wilburton date (e.g. Savory 1980, 117-8, Fig. 32) and they have commonly been found in hoards of Ewart Park date (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 275, 281 & 285 & Figs. 31, 42 & 44; Northover unpublished a, Hoards 3, 28, 63, 68, 74, 108, 114, 130, 134).

The small blade fragment (No. 3), though not definitively diagnostic has two diagnostic features, a narrow blade form combined with a blade with rounded centre section. This is sufficient to exclude the possibility of it belonging to a dagger or knife of Early Bronze Age date (e.g. Gerloff 1975), or a sword blade of Middle to Late Bronze Age date (e.g. Colquhoun & Burgess 1988). This leaves two main possibilities: either a blade fragment from a socketed knife of Late Bronze Age date or a rapier blade fragment of Middle Bronze Age date, possibly from a reworked blade.



The unusually narrow blade width is not frequently paralleled amongst the known examples of socketed knives from Wales (Gwilt et al 2005, 54). However a similar blade width and profile with a rounded centre section is seen on a single example of socketed knife from Minera, Wrexham (Savory 1980, 54, 111, Cat. 224a & Fig. 26; Gwilt et al 2005, 54). This has a blade width of approximately 16.5mm, in comparison with the range of 16.5-17.5mm width on this blade fragment. The Minera knife is of Type Thorndon, a type dating to the Late Bronze Age, with a number of associations in the Ewart Park phase dating to between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Hodges 1956; Coles 1959-60, 46; Needham 1993,44-6 & Fig. 33.10; Gwilt et al 2005, 37 & 54-55, Appendix 2).



Alternatively, this combination of blade features most closely matches one of the later types of Group IV rapiers, such as Type Appleby or Type Stuntney (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 74-84). These belong to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age but continued into the Wilburton phase at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the centuries from 1300 to 1000 BC (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 106-109). Group IV rapiers are the most common of the British rapier forms and were commonly reworked later during their use lives, often being found as broken and undiagnostic blade fragments. It is possible therefore, that a rapier made towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age could remain in use and circulation into the Late Bronze Age, only being deposited in a hoard then.



The presence of small but deliberately added quantities of lead (1-5%) to the composition of this blade fragment is however instructive in determining between these two possibilities. Metallurgical analysis of nine examples of Middle Bronze Age Group IV rapiers from Wales and The Marches has so far indicated a pattern of unleaded bronze compositions with trace lead presences (less than 0.5%) in some (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 997-1007). Similar analyses of eleven examples of Late Bronze Age socketed knives and reworked knife blades from Wales and The Marches typically show leaded bronze compositions with a range of 2.0-9.5% lead added (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1353-68). This would be in a range consistent with the composition of the blade fragment, suggesting it is probably from a socketed knife of Late Bronze Age date, and not a blade fragment from a Group IV rapier.



The spearhead fragment (No. 4) is part of a lower blade, as evidenced by the size of the internal aperture (7.5mm) along the central rib of the spear at the lower break. No diagnostic features are preserved on this spearhead fragment, to link it to type and secure date. A spearhead with a prominent rounded mid-rib and circular to oval shaped internal aperture is consistent with deriving from a larger side-looped spearhead or basal looped spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1150BC), or a pegged spearhead of Late Bronze Age date (1150-800 BC) (e.g. Ehrenberg 1977; Davis 2006; 2012). The spearhead contains a small percentage of deliberately added lead (1-5%), which may be compared with the compositions of other spearheads of side-looped, basal-looped and pegged spearheads from Wales and The Marches. The existing compositional data indicates side-looped and basal-looped spearheads of Middle Bronze Age date contain up to 1.5% lead, though most commonly less than 1% lead (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1111-1161). The plain pegged and lozenge sectioned spearheads of the Late Bronze Age contain a range of 0.6-18.6% lead composition, most commonly in the 1.5-10% range (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1164-1267). On the basis of metallurgical composition, this spearhead fragment has a lead content most likely to derive from a Late Bronze Age pegged spearhead form.



The bronze plate fragment (No. 5) proves problematic to identify to a known class of finished artefact of Bronze Age date. While its bevelled edge, slightly convex upper surface and slight concavity of the underside suggest the possibility of once belonging to a cast artefact, it exhibits no diagnostic features. However its bronze composition, with a small added component of lead (1-5%) is the same as the composition of the other artefacts and suggests that this piece is probably of contemporary age. Its similar patination, thickness and cast technology all add to this suggestion. Ingot and plate scrap fragments become recognised raw material components of hoards during the Late Bronze Age. The Guilsfield, Powys hoard contains many fragments cast plate fragments of leaded bronze (Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268, Fig. 38). It is possible therefore, that this plate fragment represents a bi-product of the bronze casting process; a piece of bronze available for recycling and casting into a finished object.



The dating of all the artefact types present in this scatter suggests a probable date during the Wilburton or Ewart Park periods of the Late Bronze Age, spanning from 1150 to 800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Typological attribution has been considerably aided by semi-quantitative analyses of the metallurgical compositions of these artefacts and their comparison with existing quantitative data from known Bronze Age metalwork from Wales and The Marches. Small, but deliberate additions of lead to the bronze in all cases, have tipped identifications of these highly fragmentary pieces in favour of known Late Bronze Age possible types and away from Middle Bronze Age possibilities. These similar compositional signatures are consistent with the artefacts being of contemporary date when deposited.



Given their tight spatial clustering within a 50m area of a field and the presence of multiple artefacts of contemporary date, it is felt that, on a balance of probability and given the evidence available, these artefacts were once probably buried together as a hoard group, and therefore may be regarded as treasure. It is probable that the artefacts had been disturbed in recent times on this shallow soil onto bedrock, possibly through spike harrowing or ploughing of marginal land during the Second World War. The finder reported also discovering modern agricultural harrow spikes of iron within the field where the artefacts were reported. It is possible that further artefacts or artefact fragments remain to be discovered in this field and were also once part of the same hoard. The association of Late palstaves, knife and spearhead in this hoard group and the highly fragmented character of artefacts reported, make its composition and character unusual for south east Wales. Here, most Ewart Park hoards are dominated by socketed axes of the South Wales type (e.g. McNeil 1973; Moore 1978; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), while complete or near complete artefacts are usually present in addition to fragmentary objects.","Metallurgical Analysis (by Mary Davis)



Qualitative surface analysis of the objects within the hoard was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6ÂµA for 100 live seconds. Surface analysis is susceptible to distortions due to the asymmetry of whole objects (rather that flat polished samples). Surface corrosion can lead to the surface enrichment (e.g. tin) and depletion (e.g. zinc) of elements; lead is often unevenly distributed within copper alloys. These factors can affect the quantities of copper and tin, lead and zinc analysed on the surface of an object.



Results



All objects are of bronze with relatively small quantities of lead deliberately added (above 1%, and probably less than 5% lead). The quantities of major elements vary, and the trace elements show different patterns of presence/absence.



The consistent and deliberate addition of small quantities of lead to these tin bronze objects provides evidence in support of their contemporary date. Specifically, it helps to demonstrate that the flat plate fragment (No. 5 above) has a composition consistent with the other artefacts in the group. The deliberate addition of lead to bronze within the casting process is first witnessed during the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Northover 1980; 1982; unpublished a, 205). For these fragmentary artefacts, which are not entirely diagnostic to type and date, this leaded bronze metallurgical composition provides evidence in support of a Late Bronze Age date, rather than a Middle Bronze Age date.

805527,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of six objects.



1. Ribbed socketed axe - South Wales Type socketed axe



Dimensions: surviving length 87.1mm; surviving blade width 44.6mm; surviving weight 156.8g.



This is a socketed axe with a damaged and largely absent mouth and damage to the blade end and lower side caused by erosion, lamination and detachment of the original surfaces from the core. The axe has a narrow and out-splayed mouth moulding, the top too damaged to observe its original shape or evidence for runner stubs. The axe is sub-rectangular in section with rounded face edges. The loop is absent, though two scars indicate the loop was high but descended from beneath the moulding. From the underside of the moulding on both faces, three ribs descend over three quarters of the length of the faces. Though largely parallel with each other, they curve slightly and converge slightly towards the blade end. Casting seams are visible down both sides, though they have been hammered down or filed. The blade end is too damaged to observe whether it was prepared for use. The axe has a brown patination and break edges are unstable and laminating in places.



2. Plain slender socketed axe fragment - unidentifiable to type



Dimensions: surviving length 84.4mm; surviving blade width 34.1mm; surviving weight 112.1g.



This is the blade and body of a plain slender socketed axe, missing its mouth end. The sides are near parallel with no evidence of recurving at the blade end. The surfaces are eroded, however there is no evidence of rib decoration on the upper blade and the face edges are rounded. The axe has a sub-rectangular cross-section. The loop is missing, though a pair of eroded scars are evident on one side. The blade edge, although eroded, exhibits a marked asymmetry, probably through repeated use and re-sharpening. The axe has a brown patination and the mouth breaks are unstable. There is surface cracking evident on one mid-face, suggesting surfaces are unstable and laminating.



3. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - unidentifiable to type



Dimensions: surviving length 76.8mm; surviving blade width 31.2mm; surviving weight 28.0g.



This is a highly eroded blade and side fragment of a slender socketed axe. The side of the axe is near straight and shows no recurving at the blade end. The narrow blade suggests a slender axe and the blade end is slightly assymetric, possibly through use and re-sharpening. The feint projecting line a possible linear rib can just be traced on the eroded axe face, suggesting that this was once a ribbed form of socketed axe. The loop is missing, however one loop scar is evident just beneath the side break, suggesting the axe was originally in the range of 100-110mm long. An apparent gently curved protrusion near the face edge has been created through differential erosion of the axe surfaces, the socket wall behind it being even and undistorted. All faces and breaks are highly eroded and the axe has a green patination.



4. Socketed axe fragment - undiagnostic



Dimensions: surviving length 59.3mm; surviving blade width 37.8mm; surviving weight 65.2g.



This is the highly eroded blade end fragment of a socketed axe. The sides are straight and parallel with no evidence of recurving at the blade end. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section. Insufficient of the axe faces survive to tell whether the axe was plain or had ribbed decoration. On one face, there is evidence of deliberate impact in antiquity with a sharp pointed tool or weapon, which has punctured and deformed the socket wall inwards in two places. The original axe surfaces are largely eroded and removed and the axe has a brown patination.



5. Socketed tool fragment - undiagnostic



Dimensions: surviving length 39.9mm; maximum surviving width 25.2mm; maximum thickness 12.5mm; surviving weight 20.3g.



This is a small highly eroded socket base and face fragment of a socketed tool of uncertain form. In side-section, the faces are tapering towards the blade end. The linear socket base and surviving width of the object suggest a narrow and flat bladed socketed tool - perhaps a socketed knife or a very slender axe. There is no moulding or change of slope evident on the surface to indicate a socket to blade transition. The lower breaks are extremely eroded, while the upper socket wall is laminating. Surface cracking and lamination is evident on one face and side. The artefact has a brown patination.



6. Jet - two runner form



Dimensions: top surface length 27.9mm; top surface width 23.9mm; maximum height 19.6mm; weight 24.6g.



This is an oval shaped jet of conical form. The upper surface is uneven and has a radial cooling pattern. The underside tapers, taking the contours of the top of the clay mould. Two runners extend beyond the base of the reservoir and are elongate oval in shape, (8.8mm long and 4.5mm wide and 6.5 by 3.8mm in size at root). At one point, an irregular bronze protrusion extends sideways, once infilling a small cavity in the top of the mould. The jet has a green patination, although an area of the underside has a dark blue-grey patina. This artefact appears fresh and unworn.



Discussion (by Adam Gwilt)



One of the socketed axes in this group (No. 1) may be confidently identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over thirty hoards now contain at least 140 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



A second axe may be tentatively identified as a ribbed socketed axe (No. 3), but undiagnostic to type. Hoards containing multiple associations of South Wales Type socketed axes are common in south east Wales. Further types of ribbed socketed axes are also known and are also common components within Late Bronze Age hoards of Ewart Park date in Wales. These are variously known as Southern English/Welby Type ribbed axes, Yorkshire Type axes, Croxton Type axes, Llanarth Type axes and Breiddin Type axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-39; Needham 1990, 32-38; Northover unpublished, 267).



The presence of a plain socketed axe of slender form (No. 2) may also be discerned, however the absence of a mouth precludes certain identification to type. However, its slender proportions, lack of facets and sub-rectangular cross-section help to rule out many plain and all faceted types, while tending to point towards the axe belonging to a Class A South-eastern type socketed axe (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 212-7; Needham 1990, 28-31; Northover unpublished, Cats. 624-53). When found in hoards in Britain, they are almost exclusively dated to the Ewart Park/Carp's Tongue phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 216-7; Needham 1990, 30).



The axe blade fragment (No. 4), although not identifiable to type, did belong to a socketed axe. Socketed axes are a diagnostic artefact form of the Late Bronze Age, with the overwhelming majority made and buried at this time. While a few exceptional examples are known in the Middle Bronze Age and certain forms continued to be made and used into the Earliest Iron Age, the vast majority known in Wales and Britain belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. O'Connor 1980, 161 & 225; Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Gwilt 2004; Northover unpublished, 237-90). Therefore, the association of such an undiagnostic blade fragment is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard of Ewart Park date (1000-800 BC).



The socketed tool fragment (No. 5) is not identifiable to artefact type. Its narrow dimensions and narrow, linear socket base suggest either the mid blade fragment of a slender or small socketed axe, or perhaps the socket to upper blade interface of a socketed knife. The seeming absence of a step between the socket and upper blade and the lack of evidence for a perforation through the wall of the socket are factors suggesting that this socket fragment does not have dimensions entirely typical of Type Thorndon or Type Dungiven socketed knives (Hodges 1956; Gwilt et al 2005, 54-5). However, it is possible that this may have belonged to a knife with a particularly long socket or not entirely conforming to typical characteristics. Socketed axes of small size or very slender form, possessing narrow sockets and narrow blade widths do exist within the overall range of sizes and dimensions of socketed axes known in Britain and Ireland (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Pearce 1983; Eogan 2000; Northover unpublished). The width of this socket is particularly slender and implying an axe with a blade width in the range of 25-35mm. Very small or slender socketed axes may be of plain, faceted or ribbed types. It is likely that many had a specialist function, as distinct from the more common and general purpose axes.



The jet of two runner form (No. 6) is the excess reservoir of metal at the top of a mould and a bi-product of the casting process. Jets are commonly incorporated into hoards during the Late Bronze Age, yet are rarely present within hoards of Early and Middle Bronze Age date. Examples with between one and four runners are known. This relatively small example with two runners could have been used to cast a socketed axe, a spearhead or a socketed tool.

The South Wales Type axe (No. 1) and jet (No. 6) are diagnostic artefacts which may be dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age spanning from 1000 BC to 800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). The less diagnostic artefact fragments belong to classes of artefacts that are also consistent with this Ewart Park date. The range of possible artefact types suggested have been found in association with socketed axes of South Wales Type and within hoards of Ewart Park date in Wales.



The account of the discovery indicates that the artefacts were found buried at significant depth beneath the surface and closely clustered together. The artefacts were retrieved from four adjacent and deep detector pits, however no archaeological burial context, such as a pit, was observed by the finder. On the basis of this evidence, a hoard of directly associated artefacts can be confirmed. The finder indicated that the find-spot was within a boggy and uncultivated field, speculating that the hoard may have been buried in an ancient pond or within a river bed. Today, springs do issue into small stream channels in the immediate vicinity of the finds and in this boggy area, although the extent to which drainage patterns may have changed during the post-Medieval period through mining and quarrying is not fully known. This specific watery landscape locality may have been deliberately selected for the deposition of the hoard as a gift to the gods (Gwilt 2004, 121; Gwilt et al 2013, 11).","References

805577,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-800,"A fragment of a copper alloy spearhead dating from the Middle or Late Bronze Age, about 1550 â 800 BC. The fragment comprises a section of the upper part of the spearhead. It is trapezoidal in plan, the blade narrowing sharply towards the tip. A high rounded rib runs longitudinally down the centre of both sides. Each terminal ends in a worn break, and exhibits a lozengiform cross section with a pronounced bulge at the rib. At the lower terminal the cross section reveals the end section of the socket within the rib. A green patina is on the surface. The fragment has lost its diagnostic features and is therefore difficult to classify further, though it is probably comparable with the range of spearheads in Davis Groups 6-11.

1. South Wales Type socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 77.4mm; mouth dimensions 50.1 x 37.7mm (external; surviving weight 203.2g.



This is a large mouth and body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe, whose blade end is entirely missing. The axe has a narrow and out-splayed mouth moulding, with three of four runner stubs visible on the upper mouth surface. The axe is rectangular in section with angled face edges. The loop is complete, descending from beneath the base of the mouth moulding. Three prominent ribs descend from the underside of the moulding on both sides, converging slightly towards the lower blade end. The ribs are discontinuous in places, suggesting imperfections in the mould, possibly through re-use. Prominent casting seams are visible down each side and appear to have been rapidly hammered down. The internal flashes inside the loop remain prominent and unfiled. The axe was poorly cast, possibly within a misaligned or ill-fitting three-part mould, with one side markedly thicker than the other, the wall being very thin on one face and side along the break. The break appears to have been made in antiquity and both faces have been dented near the break through impact with a blunt ended object, thereby narrowing the socket aperture at the break end. The axe has a green patination over undamaged surfaces. Recent damage is evident along the thin walled face and side, which has removed a rib and the upper surface, through a side shearing action with a blade. This has created a hole and fissure in the side wall, while the damaged surfaces have a light green patination.



2. Plain slender socketed axe



Dimensions: length 93.1mm; surviving blade width 39.7mm; external mouth dimensions: side to side 38.6mm, front to back 38.6mm; weight 153.7g.



This is a complete plain and slender socketed axe with a single and flared mouth moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped cross section with rounded face edges. The axe has a deep front to back socket, its mouth being sub-square in shape. A small and wide loop descends from the underside of the mouth flaring. Casting seams are visible down each side, having been partially hammered or filed down, but still projecting in places. The sides of the axe are slightly divergent and concave, flaring slightly at the blade end. The blade edge appears slightly assymetric in shape, deeper at the loop side. Striations parallel with the cutting edge indicate it was sharpened for use. The axes has a green to dark green patination, with small areas of light green powdery surface on damaged blade and around the mouth.



3. Plain socketed axe fragments (6) - Class A, South Eastern Type



Dimensions: surviving length 49.8mm; external mouth dimensions: side to side 41.6mm; combined surviving weight of fragments 63.1g; surviving weight of large fragment 52.2g.



This is a partial mouth end fragment of a plain socketed axe with a double mouth moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped cross section with rounded face edges. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped mouth. It is estimated that the front-back mouth dimension was in the range of 37-40mm, giving it a comparatively deep mouth and socket. A wide loop descends from the lower mouth moulding. The axe appears relatively wide in form, with divergent but straight upper sides, suggesting this was once a sizeable socketed axe. Untrimmed casting seams are visible down both sides. Two small fragments of mouth and lower mouth moulding were discovered pushed into the socket of the axe and these breaks are soil covered and appear to be ancient, suggesting the axe was deliberately damaged in antiquity. It is possible that the reverse face was also damaged in antiquity, as evidenced through a tear and in-turned break. A further three small axe wall fragments were retrieved at the time of discovery. The presence of fresh breaks on these and on one lower face of the larger fragment suggest this damage was caused during recent retrieval from the ground. A casting seam crack is evident on the non-loop side, probably caused by ancient or recent impact and deformation to the axe. The axe has a grey green patination, with small areas of light green powdery patination near breaks and around the top of the mouth.



4. Plain Pegged Spearhead, with elliptical leaf-shaped blade (2 fragments)



Dimensions: combined surviving length of large blade fragment and socket fragment c. 174.0mm; surviving maximum blade width 48.6mm; combined surviving weight (including concretion inside socket)135.5g.



A Plain Pegged spearhead, with a lanceolate leaf-shaped blade, broken below the base of the blade insertion. The spearhead midrib shows a marked angularity or ridge along its central length on both faces, giving its external cross-section a sub-lozengic shape at the break. The blade has a bevel 4-4.5mm wide, though only now surviving near the base of the blade and in one localised place along the upper blade, have been partially worn away over much of its length. The blade surfaces have many longitudinal striations parallel with the line of the midrib, suggesting the blade was prepared and sharpened in antiquity. A socket fragment conjoins on one face with the main blade and exhibits a continuing curved ridge, as witnessed down the midrib. An amorphous copper alloy concretion is wedged inside the socket of the spearhead. The spearhead has a grey green patination over most surfaces, although one face is differentially eroded with patches of light green corrosion evident. The tip and blade edges also have a light green patination along much of their length.



5. Lunate-opening spearhead, with leaf-shaped blade (2 fragments)



Dimensions: combined surviving length of large blade fragment and socket fragment c. 179.0mm; surviving length of blade (tip to base) approx. 117.0mm; surviving blade width 53.8mm; combined surviving weight 118.6g.



This is a leaf-shaped spearhead fragment with lunate-openings, with a missing spear tip and also broken just below the base of the blade insertion. The spearhead has an angled ridge down the centre of the blade, giving a lozenge-sectioned upper blade and hexagonal central cross-section on the lower blade, where the lunate openings occur. The angled ridge extends down the upper socket to give the socket here a sub-lozengic cross-section. The blade appears to have been widest below its mid-point and of probable lanceolate leaf-shaped form. The lunate openings are long and wide, in proportion to the blade length, and the spearhead is hollow-bladed, as best viewed along the upper blade break. The blade itself probably once extended a further 50-60mm to give a total blade length of around 150-170mm. The blade has a bevel 5.0-5.5mm wide near its base, though is heavily eroded along middle and upper blade sections. A small rectangular hole is evident in the inner wall of one of the lunate openings, while there is modern damage on one face near the upper break. A socket fragment conjoins with the large blade fragment, extending the combined surviving length to 179.0mm. A side ridge extends from the base of the blade to the point of the peg-hole, whose edge is 21-22.0mm from the base of the blade. Though incomplete and now eroded, this peg-hole appears to have been 5-6mm in diameter and there is a similar concave edge curvature at the same level on the opposing side of the socket. The spearhead has a grey green patination, with localised areas of light green corrosion at blade edges and breaks.



6. Small spearhead socket fragment (probably part of lunate-opening spearhead 5)



Dimensions: maximum surviving length 18.0mm; maximum surviving width 11.7mm; wall thickness 0.9-1.2mm; surviving weight 0.8g.



This is a small socket fragment, found within the backfill of the detector pit, when the find-spot was subsequently investigated. Its thickness and curvature is consistent with the incomplete sockets of the two spearheads in the hoard. The breaks are soil covered and not apparently freshly made. Attempts to re-fit the fragment have not yielded a certain clean join, however it is very probable that this fragment once belonged to the socket of the lunate opening spearhead (No. 5 above). On one side of this fragment is an even concave curve, suggesting part of the aperture of a peg-hole. This is consistent with a peg-hole of 6mm in size, similar to that observed on the conjoining socket fragment of the lunate-opening spearhead. The fragment has a grey-green patination.



7. 'Copper alloy' amorphous drib fragment



Dimensions: maximum length 37.5mm; maximum width 12.9mm; maximum height 11.6mm; weight 5.6g.



This is a small amorphous 'copper alloy' drib fragment, exhibiting no sign of shaping into an artefact form. It is possible that this represents the excess bi-product of a casting or metalworking event, or alternatively, was once an artefact that was heated to a very high temperature and molten state. The possible underside of the fragment has a very uneven surface, taking the contours of the uneven surface on which it lay or landed on. One end of the reverse face has a rounded convex and smooth surface, with two small protrusions, indicating cooling and solidifying from molten state. At the opposite end of the upper surface, there is a thickening of the metal, which projects upwards unevenly. Here, the metal contains holes or vesicles, suggesting bubbling when the metal cooled and solidified.




Metallurgical Analysis of the copper alloy fragment (Mary Davis)



Qualitative surface analysis of the copper alloy fragment (No. 6 above) was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. There was no surface preparation of the artefacts; the relatively high kV setting deployed would have allowed penetration of the X-rays through corrosion layers, and resulting spectra could be compared with those from similar artefacts, but would not allow for the production of quantitative data.



Results



The 'copper alloy' fragment was revealed to be a zinc alloy, containing at least 90% zinc, plus a small amount of copper. Alloys containing significant quantities of zinc are not found in Britain until the Late Iron Age, when brass containing up to c. 27% zinc was first introduced as a copper-zinc alloy (Bayley 1998, 13). Metallic zinc was not isolated in Europe until the post-medieval period; the composition of this piece strongly suggests a date within the last 100-200 years. It could be the bi-product of a metal casting event or the result of the heating of a zinc artefact (melting point 420oC), causing it to become molten and lose its original form.



Identification and Discussion (Adam Gwilt, Mark Lodwick & Mary Davis)



One of the socketed axes in this group (No. 1) may be confidently identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, approaching forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



The plain slender socketed axe (No. 2) is difficult to identify to a widespread type, although the absence of any mouth moulding or collar precludes many recognised types. In combination, the slender form with flaring mouth, sub-rectangular section and deep mouth plan, with slightly concave divergent sides and modest blade expansion, are most closely paralleled with Class 5 plain socketed axes from Ireland (Eogan 2000, 42-5, Cats. 201-25 & Pls. 11-12) or the miscellaneous slender socketed axes with rectangular bodies provisionally grouped together within Scotland and northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 217-8, Cats. 1295-1303, Pl. 86). They have been found associated within hoards of Ewart Park / Dowris date (1000-800 BC) in Britain and Ireland, although an earlier origin within the preceding Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-950 BC) is suspected but remains unproven (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 218; Eogan 2000, 45). In Wales, a plain socketed axe of similar form has been found within a hoard at Margam Beach, Neath-Port Talbot, beside two other plain socketed axes and a South Wales type ribbed socketed axe (Wear unpublished; Northover unpublished, Hoard 76). This hoard is dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC).



The mouth fragment and accompanying small fragments of the second plain socketed axe (No. 3) may be confidently identified as of Class A - South-eastern Type (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 212-7; Needham 1990, 28-31; Northover unpublished, Cats. 624-53). This form is characterised by a double mouth-moulding, of which the upper moulding is the more prominent, with the lower giving rise to the loop on one side, with a sub-rectangular body section, squarish mouth and plain non-faceted faces. When found in hoards in Britain, they are almost exclusively dated to the Ewart Park/Carp's Tongue phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 216-7; Needham 1990, 30). In south-east Wales, Class A - South-eastern Type socketed axes are repeated presences within hoards of this same date, with single examples present in the Tal-y-garn (1&2) (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Margam Beach (Neath-Port Talbot), Llantwit Major, Pendoylan (both Vale of Glamorgan), Glascoed (Monmouthshire) and Myddfai (Carmarthenshire) hoards (e.g. Storrie 1887; GGAT 1977-8; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, 121, Cat. 281 & Fig. 42; 1984, 441; Briggs & Williams 1995;Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1. 3; Northover unpublished, H 38,74, 76, 79; Wear unpublished).



One of the spearheads (No. 4) may be identified as a Plain Pegged Spearhead with a leaf shaped blade. Pegged spearheads, as an artefact class, generally span from the second half of the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard (Swansea), Guilsfield (Powys) and Princetown (Blaenau Gwent) hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150 BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920 BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800 BC. In Wales, there are currently thirteen other known hoards of Ewart Park date which include Plain Pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen, Manorbier (both Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (both Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llantarnam (Torfaen), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick 2011; unpublished; Gwilt et al, 2011a; 2011b). The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age dating to between 1000 BC and 800 BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3; Needham et al 1997, 93-8).



The second spearhead (No. 5) may be identified as a leaf-shaped Pegged Spearhead with Lunate-openings. This artefact class was first developed during the second half of the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1050-950 BC), being present within hoards of this date from Wilburton (Cambridgeshire), Blackmoor (Hampshire) and Guilsfield (Powys) (Burgess et al 1972, 214; Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Figs. 32-8). However, they flourished within the later Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC), becoming one of the type fossils within the Broadward Complex of large spearhead dominated warrior hoards whose distribution extends across the Marches, into south-west England, across central southern England and into East Anglia and Yorkshire (Burgess et al 1972, 221, 230-5, Fig. 1c; Northover unpublished, 247).



In looking at the overall composition of the hoard, the combination of spearheads and axes suggests an intermediate position between the spearhead dominated warrior hoards of the Broadward tradition and the axes, tools and casting bi-products defining most Late Bronze Age hoards of the Llantwit-Stogursey tradition across south-east Wales and the Carp's Tongue tradition across southern England. Metalwork with Broadward Complex affinities is not abundant in Wales, the evidence currently comprising the Pant-y-Maen (Pembrokeshire) spearhead hoard (Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 232 & 240), the Princetown (Blaenau Gwent) spearhead pair (Savory 1972; 1980, 119 & 188, Cat. 272, Fig. 40; Green & Northover 1981; Gwilt 2004, 115-6, Appendix 1.2, Fig. 5.1) and a single barbed spearhead, now lost from Pendoylan (Burgess et al 1972, 232; Savory 1984, 441; Northover unpublished 251).



The amorphous 'copper alloy' (No. 7) was analysed and discovered to be a zinc alloy, comprising over 90% zinc and a small amount of copper. Technologically it cannot be of Late Bronze Age date and it very probably dates to recent times, and is certainly post-medieval or later. Therefore, it cannot be deemed to be directly associated with and buried beside the other five Late Bronze Age artefacts in this hoard.","References

1. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 118.3mm; surviving blade width 63.7mm; surviving weight 266.7g.



This is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and very slightly divergent towards the blade end and the sides curve out suddenly to a widely expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The butt end is damaged, making it impossible to tell whether it was straight ended or arched. Approximately 57mm from the butt end, there is a low stopridge across both faces. The flanges, although now damaged, would have risen approximately 3mm above the septum on each face. The blade edge is damaged and fragile, making it difficult to accurately determine the original blade width. On one face, just below the stopridge, the feint traces of decorative hammer marks can be observed, forming three or four linear zones parallel with the stopridge. Hammer marks are also evident along the sides of the axe, though forming no distinct faceting or patterning. On the recurving side of one blade edge, a number of impact marks are present, suggesting use wear. On one upper septum face, there is a patch of green corrosion product. The overall patination is green, although the damaged blade edge, flanges, butt end and stop-ridge have a blue green colouration. These edges are fragile and powdery.



2. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 119.0mm; surviving blade width 68.1mm; surviving weight 223.0g.



This is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and near parallel, the lower sides curving out to a cutting edge that is widely expanded and with a crescentic blade edge. The butt end is damaged, however there is curvature in the remaining edge, suggesting the butt was originally arched. Approximately 51mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges, though partly damaged, rise approximately 2.0mm above the septum on both sides. The blade edge is damaged and fragile and the surviving blade width is less than the original blade width. The sides are hammer faceted into three facets, with cable hammer decoration evident. The overall patination is green-brown in colour, while damaged blade edge, butt end and flanges have a lighter blue-green colouration. The damaged surfaces are fragile and powdery.



3. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 113.5mm; surviving blade width 57.5mm; surviving weight 199.8g.



This is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and slightly divergent towards the blade end, the lower sides curving out to a cutting edge that is widely expanded and with a crescentic blade edge. The butt end is damaged, making it impossible to determine whether the butt end was arched. Approximately 47.5mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges, though damaged, are estimated to have risen approximately 2.0mm above the septum on both sides. The blade edge is damaged and fragile, making it difficult to determine the original blade width. The sides are hammer faceted into three facets. On one side, feint cable hammer decoration can still be observed within the middle facet. It is probable that similar decoration, originally on the other side, has now worn away. On one face, a large patch of blue corrosion can be observed. The axe has a green brown coloured patination, while the damaged blade edge, butt end, flanges and corrosion patches on one face have a lighter blue-green colouration. The damaged surfaces are fragile and powdery.



Identification and Discussion (Adam Gwilt)



These three axes may all be identified as Class 5 long-flanged axes belonging to the Arreton - Ebnal-Inch Island/Gavel Moss phase (Period 4, Metalwork Assemblage VI) of the Early Bronze Age (e.g. Northover unpublished, 104-13; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-5; Needham et al 1985, iii; Needham 1996, 132-3; Rohl & Needham 1998, 91-2). They are contemporary with the Wessex 2 rich grave tradition and Camerton-Snowshill dagger and knife series across southern Britain, now independently radiocarbon dated to 1750/1700-1500 BC (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 179-80; Needham & Woodward 2008, 7, Fig. 3; Needham et al 2010, 364-5 & Table 1; Woodward & Hunter 2015, 462).



One of the flanged axes (No. 1 above) is typologically slightly different to the other two, having a stopridge, rather than a median bevel, being notably thicker in casting and having more prominent cast flanges. Unfortunately, the butt end is damaged, making it impossible to tell whether the butt end was originally straight, as predicted for this type. This shows similarities with Type Balbirnie long-flanged axes of Scotland and with some of the axes included within Type Derryniggin flanged axes of Ireland (e.g. Harbison 1969, 55-66, Pls. 69-78; Burgess & Cowen 1972, 178-9; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-2, Cats. 396-407A; Northover unpublished, 112). This flanged axe would seem to exhibit characteristics more similar to the Inch Island / Gavel Moss metalworking tradition of Ireland and Scotland (e.g. Burgess 1980, 122; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 71-2), although it would also fit within the metrical parameters of a Class 5Da axe (Needham 1983, 198-250). Its more pronounced flanges (RHF of 0.0314) suggest that it could be typologically slightly more developed than the other two flanged axes in the hoard.



Two flanged axes (Nos. 2 & 3 above) exhibit very similar attributes: a more slender form, with median bevels, low cast flanges, hammer faceting and hammer cable decoration on their sides. These best correlate with Type Arreton long-flanged axes most densely distributed across southern, eastern and south-western England (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 176-8, Figs. 6 & 7; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 72-5, Cats. 408-25B; Needham 1985; Needham et al 1985, iii; Northover unpublished Cats. 95-108). When the critical measurements for these flanged axes are applied within Needham's metrical classification of Class 5 axes for central and southern Britain (Needham 1983, 198-250), both appear to fit within the parameters of Class 5Da axes, while their relative flange heights, at 0.0216 and 0.0225, sit within the lower range for true Class 5 flanged axes (Needham 1983, 65-6 & 198, Figs. 72-6).



In Wales and The Marches, two published hoards of broadly comparable date and containing Arreton type, Class 5 long-flanged axes are the Menai Bridge, Anglesey and Ebnal, Shropshire hoards (Chitty 1940; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Savory 1946; 1980, 115, Cats. 259-60 & Figs. 18 & 29; Needham 1983, 300-13, Fig. 48.1; Lynch 1991, 218-21 & Fig. 60; Northover unpublished, 106-8, H. 7 & 164). Unfortunately, in each case, many of the artefacts reported in the hoards, both discovered during the nineteenth century, have been lost: there are only three of eight axes surviving in the Menai Bridge hoard (single axes now at Bangor Museum, Amgueddfa Cymru and The British Museum) while only one of three axes originally in the Ebnal hoard survives (Savory 1980, 115 & Cat. 260.3, Fig. 29). A further Arreton hoard with flanged axe fragments has very recently been reported from Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (Treasure Case 15.03), but has yet to be studied and reported upon in detail.



Two of the flanged axes (Nos. 2 & 3) were found in direct association, while the third was found approximately 3-4m away from the other two. The discovery of all three axes at significant depths of approximately 0.46m beneath the surface is unusual, especially if one is to interpret that the three axes were originally buried together in direct association as a hoard, but dispersed through recent agricultural activity. Commonly, dispersed hoards are discovered at shallower depths, with dispersed artefacts found within shallower ploughsoil, rather than at depth. A number of tenable possibilities can be offered, to explain this. Firstly, it is possible that the hoard was disturbed in antiquity, only to be covered by deep clay soil deposits. Secondly, the hoard may have been disturbed in recent times, only to be recently covered during depression infilling events by the landowner with overlying soil deposit. Thirdly, it is possible that the hoard could have been disturbed at depth by the cutting of deep drainage channels, with one axe being dragged and moved along the line of the drain.



Finally, it is possible that tentative attempts may have been made to deep plough this area of marginal land, leading to disturbance of the hoard. In addition, it has been shown that the three flanged axes all date to exactly the same Arreton phase of the Early Bronze Age, and could all have been used and deposited at the same time. These axes are relatively rare discoveries in Wales, with only around twenty examples known to date from hoards and as single finds (e.g. Needham 1983, Figs. 224-31; Northover unpublished, 105, Cats. 95-108). It seems unlikely that a third example of closely similar form and date would be buried separately and as a single find at the same place. Therefore, overall, and on a balance of probability given the available evidence, it is felt probable that the third flanged axe was once buried in direct association with the other two and as part of a single hoard group.","References

806523,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"Dr Peter Chowne writes: a complete cast copper-alloy developed side-looped spearhead that can be assigned to Davis Group 6A (Davis, 2012). The terminology used below follows that of Davis. Although complete there is some damage to the blade both ancient and modern, probably the result of agricultural activity. Surface colour is predominantly dark brown some of the damaged areas have green corrosion. The tip of a wooden shaft survives within the socket. Length: 125 mm, Width: 26 mm, D; 72 mm, Weight: 67.1 g. The blade is flame-shaped with a low (25%) 'Position of Maximum Width' and slightly concave blade edges. The blade surface is flat with a distinct bevel to the blade edges. It has a long midrib with a circular cross-section. The socket base aperture is 19 mm at the widest point. Loop plates have been modified after casting and are lozenge-shaped. Grooves left by sharpening are visible on the bevels and edges of the blade. There are clear indications of working around the loops in the form of striations made by an abrasive tool such as a file.



Type 6A have a number of distribution concentrations the main ones being the Thames Valley and East Anglian fenland. There is a secondary distribution in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Northumberland and eastern Scotland. Spearheads of this type have been found in Lincolnshire at Digby (Daubney 2010), Temple Bruer (Vine, 1987) and Tetford (Davey, 1973). The Digby example most closely resembles this spearhead from Woolsthorpe by Belvoir. There is a similar example on display in Yorkshire Museum. The provenance is 'Yorks"" and it is slightly larger and heavier than the Woolsthorpe spearhead (Davis, 2012, 16 no. 224; Radley, 1967).



Group 6 spearheads are most likely to date to the Taunton metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1250 cal BC) although the earliest examples may date to the late stages of the preceding Acton Park phase. Dating is based primarily on hoard associations.

812323,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Cast copper alloy casting jet with two conical sprues or flashes that is ovate in plan, with two conical projections that are triangular in profile. The casting jet was formed during the casting of a socketed axe in a two-part mould, where the molten bronze was poured into the entrance of the mould around the gate piece which had two conical apertures that the bronze then solidified in once it had filled the mould for the axe. Socketed axes of this type date from the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC).



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar casting jet with conical sprues from Lelant in Cornwall, which was found associated with swords fragments that are from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) on page 571, pl.10, no.82e.

The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to dark brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety.

813624,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete copper alloy Socketed Axehead of probably the Late Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1000 - BC 800.



Around 50% of the axehead is present, consisting of the body and part of the blade. Some of the blade and the top, and handle of the object are missing presumed lost in antiquity.



The object is broadly rectangular in plan and rectangular in section. The top has been broken and object has been pinched or squashed together, giving a concave appearance on both sides of the axe. The object is hollow. The remains of a loop are present on the left side of the object at the top and it appears there is a join where the handle meets the body. The object may have some decoration in the form of two U shaped grooves towards the top of the axe, however this is difficult to see clearly and could possibly be post depositional damage. The sides of the object taper in, forming an arc on either side, then flare slightly to form the cutting edge or blade. The blade is damaged and part is missing, the blade tapers to a point at the base of the object. This has been damaged, and a distinct cutting edge is missing.



The object measures 51.7 mm in length and is 38.7 mm wide at the top of the object and the blade is 35.6 mm wide. It has a maximum thickness, at the top of the object of 9.9 mm. Where the axe has been pinched the thickness is 5.2 mm and the blade is 5.8 mm thick. It weighs 66.3 g.



The object is a mid green in colour with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Broadly similar axes have been recorded in Schmidt (1981), Plate 72 - 75, however diagnostics are difficult due to damage.



EDIT:



Peter Reavill suggests that this is possibly a worn and damged Irish imported, Faceted Axe, type Gillespie sometimes known as 'baggy axe'. It has been discovered in associated with the late Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase XI) and the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-700 CAL. BC. For an example see HESH-05A063. 



From HESH-05A063: This axe is an unusual find in Shropshire whose known distribution focuses on ribbed axes. This type of faceted axe is therefore rare and its presence important. This axe is of a type which is known as Type Gillespie, which Burgess and Schmidt suggest is associated with later Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). They are also discovered in Oreland and are associated with the Dowris tradition. It has been suggested that this form of facet axe continues production into the Llyn Fawr tradition (which is the transitional period between the metalwork of the Bronze and Iron Ages. Similar axes have been illustrated in Burgess and Schmidt and the best parallels are cat no 1109 Grahams Mount, Midlothian, 1112 Hatton, Angus, and 1121 Stanton Quarry, Furness, Lancs. A more local example can be see in the Savory Welsh catalogue from a small hoard of axes discovered at Llandaff, Glamorganshire (cat no 282). This final Welsh axe had been analysed and the metal content was comparable with axes from the second phase of the Late Bronze Age (LBA II) which Savory dates 750-600 BCbut would actually be better described as Ewart Park 950-750 BC).

Less than 25% of the socketed axehead is present, and consists of part of the mouth and body. The rest is missing, presumed lost in antiquity,



The mouth may have originally been square in shape, as the fragment exhibits an almost right angle bend. The mouth has a rolled rim. The start of two ribs are present on the body.

The socketed axehead fragment is mostly a dark green colour, with the odd light green patch. These lighter areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occuring, which exhibitis as a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the fragment should be stored in a sealed airtight dry box (such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal), with plenty of silica gel.

The axe has a shield shaped pattern below a very slight stop ridge, and raised flange facets. The blade of the object expands outwards to a crescentic cutting edge. The cutting edge measures 1mm thick. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the start of the flanges) is 37mm in length.



At the top of the blade below the flanges on each face of the object is an incised U-shaped groove which is probably an area of decoration typically described as shield shaped. The rear part of the axe (from the slight stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The flanges are worn and turn slightly inwards towards the septum where the handle would have been hafted.



The object has a dark black-brown patina and is heavily pitted in places with the pitting maintaining the same patina.



Many short flanged axes of this type are very narrow and they are probably a specialist tool / chisel. They evolve into palstaves when the stop ridges fuse with the side flanges

816882,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"A fragment of a copper alloy spearhead, dating to the middle or late Bronze Age (1200-800BC). Only the tip of the spearhead remains, which is triangular in shape, and lozenge in cross section with a worn midrib. The break is worn and irregular, on one side it has been broken higher up the tip revealing the circular hollow socket. An insufficient amount of the spear remains to prove diagnostic, therefore a specific type cannot be attributed. The tip has a light green patina, inside the hollow socket is orange corrosion. The fragment measures 24.9mm in length, 11.3mm in width, and 5.6mm in thickness.

816960,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete copper alloy palstave with raised flange facets dating from the Middle Bronze Age (1500 BC - 1150 BC).



The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and an incomplete convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The sides of the blade are convex in shape. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the stop ridge) is 75.4 mm long and the width of cutting edge is 55.3 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 7.0 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 17.4 mm (measured at thickest part below the stop ridge, the width at this point is 28.8 mm).



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 64.1 mm long, 24.2 mm wide, and 12.9 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving two rounded corners with a gap between. The butt is 27.1 mm wide and 58.7 mm thick.



The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by.



In total the palstave measures 134.8 mm in length, 55.3 mm wide (maximum) and 22.7 mm thick. It weighs 168.3 g.



The palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface. 



XRF analysis on this palstave was carried out at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery conservation laboratory, using a Mistral Tabletop XRF machine. The results are below:

817257,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-900,"Copper alloy Middle Bronze Age side looped and socketed spearhead, recently broken into two pieces. The blade is leaf-shaped with a lozengiform sectioned midrib. It exhibits a hollow socket and cast side loops. The spearhead measures 126mm total length, 20.8mm maximum width, 1.6mm minimum width. The mouth has a diameter of 17.1mm. It weighs 42.3g.



The tip of the blade exhibits some chipping and the edges of the blade are incomplete due to old breakages. The blade measures 73.8mm in length. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering lozenge shaped midrib which expands into the socket of the spear. The socket mouth is circular in shape and exhibits old breakages around the circumference. The socket is filled with soil. Just below the bottom of the blade, the spear has suffered a recent break across the socket, probably as a result of agricultural activity. The mouth of the socket is filled with soil. At the break point there are traces of wood visible.



The loops are positioned on either side of the socket, just below the break, approximately opposite one another. The loops measure c.16.5mm in length, 6.1mm in width and project 2.5mm from the socket. Casting ribs are visible running along both sides of the body from the mouth to the point at which the blade commences and appear to have been filed.



The spearhead has a mottled dark brown patina with patches of green.



Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).
