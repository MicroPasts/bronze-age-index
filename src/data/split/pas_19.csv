1021386,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1600,40,"A complete cast copper-alloy unidentified 'moustache-shaped' object of probable middle Bronze Age to Iron Age date. The centre of the object is narrowed with a convexly curved upper edge and is rounded and hollow underneath. A vertically aligned circular perforation extends through it. To either side is a tapering tear-dropped shaped element that is D-shape in cross-section and has rounded edges and pointed ends, one of which is broken with an old uneven break. These elements are flat on the underside and are attached to the central section via a step-down. The pronouncedly curved upper surface of the elements are decorated with a series of grooved striations along their length.



The object is 24mm long, 22mm wide and weighs 10 grams.



There is little dating evidence available for these enigmatic objects. An example was found with the Salisbury Hoard, indicating a Bronze or Iron Age date; the style might suggest an Iron Age date.



Such objects are of uncertain date but comparable objects recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database include NMS-A0C513, NARC-6A4546, LVPL-B000C6, HAMP-6F4C45, PUBLIC-E9E1C5, NARC-925E14, WILT-616785, KENT-77A0BF and SF-722CF5.",Recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic with information and images provided by the finder.,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-09-30T23:00:00Z,2019-10-31T00:00:00Z,,,10,,,,24,1,Dot Boughton,Matthew Fittock,Eastern,Hertfordshire,East Hertfordshire,Walkern,TL2925,From finder,51.9086067,-0.12611729,BH-BD3AFC,,BHBD3AFC.jpg,Bronze Age to Iron Age unidentified object,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BHBD3AFC.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1141830.jpg
1021395,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy Middle Bronze Age socketed spearhead dating to the period 1500-1150 BC.



The spearhead has a leaf-shaped blade that tapers towards the rounded tip, with a raised cross-sectional rib from tip to base. The wings are bevelled and gradually expand before tapering inwards at the narrowest point of the shaft. The wing edges are very worn and damaged in several places. 



The shaft is broadly sub-conical and circular in cross-section. It increases in diameter from the narrowest point to the open-ended socket. Small loops project part way along the shaft either side.



The surfaces of the spearhead have mid green patination with several areas of lamination revealing mid brown underneath. Pits and abrasions are evident across all surfaces.



The spearhead measures 70mm in length and 13mm wide. It weighs 14.05 grams.



This spearhead is part of the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions and is dated to the Middle Bronze Age, between c. 1500 - 1150 BC. Several similar spearheads of this type are recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database.

1021454,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Early Bronze Age fragmentary bronze flat axe of uncertain type perhaps contemporary with Type Migdale axes  as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 35-44)[1], of Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham’s (1996)[2] Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 – 1,900BC.



The axe comprises a worn blade fragment (with a surviving length of 39.7mm and a weight of 63.6g). The break has occurs in antiquity across the thickest surviving part of the axe (where the axe has a width of 27mm and a thickness of 7.3mm). The sides are worn and corroded but appear to have been straight and divergent but widening more sharply at the blade. The blade tips have been lost (giving the blade a surviving width of 40.8mm). Both blade faces are gently convex across their width and flat across their lengths, before narrowing more sharply at a poorly defined blade facet. The original blade edge has been lost but now has a comparatively deep curve. The surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-green patina with areas of bright-green active corrosion. 





The fragmentary state of the object makes any definite identification difficult and typological identification more problematic. The general form, with a lack of developed features and straight, divergent sides are broadly consistent with Type Migdale axes, dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2200 – 1900BC). Metallurgical Analysis was undertaken by Mary Davis[3], with three readings taken from a micro-sample and analysed by Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy; minor and trace element analysis is included; although possibly inaccurate, particularly when below 0.1%, but give an indication of presence and absence, which researchers are finding significant for analyses of Early Bronze Age material. The results indicate a tin-bronze with significant trace elements of zinc and lead. The measured percentage results are:

1021611,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-750,-600,"Copper alloy fragment, probably a blade edge fragment from a Bronze Age axe of undetermined type and date but possibly a fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe



The axe is fragmentary, represented by a side fragment of a blade edge only (with a surviving width of 17.1mm, a surviving length of 25.5mm, a maximum surviving may possibly have broken across the base of a socket, possibly suggested by a depression on the break. Only a very short part of the blade edge survives (7mm). The casting seam is evident on the surviving side, with the suggestion that the sides are angled to the centre. The side is slightly convex across its surviving length. Both face are slightly convex across their lengths with no discernible blade facet or ribs surviving. The surface is corroded with some surviving dark green patina.





The fragmentary state of the object makes identification difficult and typological identification indeterminate. Although it is possible to tentatively suggest the base of a socket on the fragment and together with angled sides, indicating a hexagonal body section may indicate a socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date, c. 750 – 600BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,,,,,25.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9775,,51.4645671,-3.48411224,NMGW-155FEB,,2015512.jpg,Bronze age axehead fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2015512.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1131695.jpg

Flanking both faces of the axe is a wide, flat based channel that emanates from the tips of the blade.  Running the length of the axe, each channel gently expanding to the rear collar and gives the axe an overall hexagonal cross-section. Further decoration can be found on both sides where six transverse grooved lines are positioned before the collar. The Collar is undecorated and gently curves out at its base to form an expanded flanged terminal. 



On the side of the axe is a loop that is made from a rectangular arched band that has two channels running its length.  These loops are normally positioned to run lengthways down the axe; however, this example has the loop positioned transversely across the axe.

1022391,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-750,"Late Bronze Age bronze ‘Late’ Palstave of Type Isleham as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 158-163)[1], dated to late Wilburton or Ewart Park metalworking industries (ibid.) and dated to perhaps 1100 – 750BC



The palstave is near-complete, with some peripheral damage to the flanges (with a length of 136.6mm, and a weight of 304.1g). The butt is straight and like the septum, is thick (with a width of 19.6mm and a thickness of 6.5mm). The sides are straight and gently divergent as far as the stop (where it has a width of 25.1mm). The loop begins before the stop and continues on to the side of the blade (with a length of 26.0mm, a width of 8.8mm, a height of 9.1mm and giving an overall width of 29.7mm). The palstave narrows slightly to the blade (at 19.5mm), after which the sides are gradually divergent and produce a slightly expanded blade edge, with some damage and loss to the blade tips (with a blade edge width of 33.6mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and have been neatly finished but are more-finished and barely discernible on the sides of the blade. The flanges rise from well below the butt (13mm) and rise linearly to reach their maximum depth (of 31.1mm) at the stop.  The stop is comparatively straight and is perpendicular to the septum (with a height of 9.6mm). The thick septum is enhanced on both faces with three parallel ribs, beginning at the stop and ending before the flanges start (with a length of 34mm). Both blade faces are decorated with three short, parallel ribs (19.1mm long) beginning beneath the stop. The stop is raised above the blade (3.2mm high) with a near-perpendicular bevel to the blade faces. The blade faces are straight and convergent, before converging more sharply to the blade edge but with a subtle but discernible blade facet. Hammer facets are evident on the blade and occasional striations, possibly from sharpening. The surface has a mid to dark green and black patina with areas of bright green corrosion. 



The palstave has many of the characteristic attributes of ‘Late’ palstaves and the ribbed blade decoration with nipped-in waist under the stop, suggests Type Isleham. The continuation of the ribs on the septum is an unusual feature and is difficult to parallel. The ribbed septum would have helped to eliminate rotational movement when hafted.

The axe is fragmentary, represented by a mouth and upper face and side fragment (with a surviving length of 27.1mm, a surviving width of 23.5mm, a surviving depth of 8mm and a weight of 13.5g) with all of the breaks occurring in antiquity. The mouth is rounded (6.5mm thick and 8mm long) with no casting runner stubs present on the mouth.  Beneath the collar is a horizontal moulding on the mouth and side. The face (with a thickness of 4mm) has the top of two of the three ribs descending from the moulding and continuing to the break. The face is flat across its width and its length, beneath the collar. The side has a slight angle, perhaps suggesting a hexagonal body section on the axe. There is no evidence for a loop on the side. The socket is flat across both its length and width.  





The fragmentary condition of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The horizontal moulding beneath the collar indicates that the axe was not of South Wales Type but may be of Type Welby, Type Yorkshire or other similar types of Ewart Park metalworking but also may possibly of Sompting or allied types of Llyn Fawr metalworking.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,13.5,,,8,27.1,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Wenvoe,ST1373,,51.44927745,-3.25335867,NMGW-3D42CC,,20151043.jpg,Bronze age socketed axe fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/20151043.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1134177.jpg
1022532,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"Middle Bronze Age bronze socketed spearhead of Davis’ (2012)[1] Group 6: Developed side-looped, unclassified (Greenwell and Brewis (1909)[2] Class IV (or socket -looped)) spearheads and of later Arreton, Acton Park, Taunton or early Wilburton metalworking (c. 1500 – 1100BC), of Needham’s (1996)[3] Periods 4-5



The spearhead is incomplete missing both most of blade and the socket mouth (with a surviving length of 70.2mm and a weight of 28.5g). The socket was circular, with a small fragment of the simple rim surviving (with a maximum surviving internal diameter of 14.0mm and an external diameter of 16.7mm). The socket continues to the break across the blade. The sides of the socket are near-straight and gradually convergent. One of the loops is complete and is flat-topped of linear form (20mm long by 3mm wide), which begin 20mm from the socket mouth. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval (4.0-5mm long and 2mm high). Both sides have a ridge, running between the mouth and the base of the loop. Between the top of the loop and the base of the blade are five to six short horizontal incised lines, perhaps referencing or accommodating the binding. Only a small part of the blade survives (with a surviving length of 18.6mm and maximum surviving width of 45.6mm) but the gentle curve may suggest a leaf-shaped blade. The damaged blade edge with a blade facet is evident and survives on one side. Above the loop, the socket becomes increasingly oval-sectioned and defines a prominent midrib along the blade, as far as the break (with a thickness at the break of 9.5mm). The break occurred in antiquity and the socket (4.9mm diameter) is off-centre at the break (with a minimum thickness of 0.4mm). The spearhead has been neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is partially-preserved with a dark brown patina. Sharpening striations are evident beneath the patina running along the blade on the better preserved face. 





Group 6, side-looped spearheads have a long-lived production, spanning the end of Arreton in the Early Bronze Age to Wilburton at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. A side-looped spearhead of Davis’ (2012) Group 6, Type A was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London[4], and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving. The shaft was radiocarbon dated by Needham et al (1997, DOB 31)[5] to 1680 – 1400BC (with 95% confidence). A Group 6, Type D spearhead from Tormarton, Gloucestershire has two radiocarbon dates (1390 – 1010BC and 1310-1057BC) (Davis 2012, ibid. p 7). Most Group 6 spearheads however are likely to date from Acton Park and Taunton industries.

1022877,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-1050,"A complete Bronze Age cast copper-alloy spearhead of basal-looped triangular form, 106.35mm in length. The blade is triangular, with a pair of small loops at the junction between the lower blade edge and the socket. The root of the blade juts out at right angles from these loops. The socket is conical, continuing along the blade as a broad rib with circular cross section, with the flat blade projecting to either side. There are possibly small ribs running along the blade from the ends of the loops which are aligned with the midrib, however the condition of the object makes these very difficult to see clearly. The patina is dark, with pale patches of corrosion / encrustation typical of long exposure to a riverine environment. This spearhead is likely to date from circa 1200 to 1050 BC.","The style can potentially be identified as Davis Type 9c (also identifiable as Greenwell and Brewis IIIa) and is seen as an indigenous development from earlier leaf-shaped Middle Bronze Age forms which is associated with the Penard industry. This dates to the transition from the middle to late Bronze Age. This is a relatively rare tradition, with finds typically concentrated in the lower Thames Valley (Pearce, 1984: 41; Ehrenberg, 1977: 11), as with this example, which was a foreshore find from the Thames and may have originally comprised a votive deposit in the river. Similar examples from the upper Thames valley are published in Ehrenberg (1977: Fig 17) and more generally in Langmaid (1976, 52; 18a/b). This is an unusually small example of the type.

1023130,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,1150,600,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy leaf shaped spearhead, probably of Davis (2017) Group 7, dating from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (1150 BC-600 BC).



The surviving portion is a length of the hollow leaf-shaped blade with tapering edges and a rounded tip. At the opposite end there is one surviving shoulder, which terminates in an uneven worn break, revealing the hollowed interior, which extends right through to the tip. The external edges of the blade are uneven in form and are all worn and rounded, as is the tip. 



On one side the body is significantly damaged with a large portion of the once conical socket compressed and collapsed in several places with several portions missing, revealing the hollow interior within. The junctures between the socket and blade are also cracked in several places along the length of the blade either side of the compressed and collapsed areas.



The opposite face remains intact but is likewise compressed along the central axis of the blade, with subsequent cracking in several areas either side.



The form of the spearhead suggests that it is probably a conical spearhead variant. The shape of the blade resembles the leaf-shaped spearheads of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage (1000-800 BC) and is probably a Davis Group 7 type missing its more diagnostic side-loop and decorative features. Peter Reavill and Dot Boughton note that as it is missing these features, the earliest to which it could date is 1150 BC during the late Penard metalworking phase.

The blade is narrow and triangular with a pronounced, broad mid rib, on both sides extending to the tip of the spear which tapers in to a point. In cross section the object is lozenge shaped. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. There are multiple abrasions and missing portions of the edges. The fragment terminates in an old abraded transverse break. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing and the retained portions has a shallow concave aspect expose by the break.



The metal is a dark-brown in colour with areas of green and light brown corrosion and a pitted and corroded patina.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1500-c. 800 cal BC).

1023946,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"An incomplete cast copper alloy Bronze Age axe (1150 BC-800 BC). The axe is a plain long socketed type and slender in form. 

The axehead has been damaged and is incomplete missing the mouth and the loop (with a surviving length of 72.6mm and weight of 95.13g). The break is from old damage (where the axe has a maximum surviving width of 29.5mm, thickness of 21.1mm and socket depth of 43.1mm) and has a sub-rectangular section at the break with the end of the bottom loop on one side just before the break. The loop end is corroded and is represented by a small raised stub. The sides of the fragment are bevel slightly to the casting seams (which are smooth, probably hammer-finished) each running the length of the blade on the top and bottom. The sides diverge gently before flaring slightly towards the blade edge (with a blade width of 36.6mm). Towards the blade edge (11.5mm from blade edge) a darker gradient possibly indicates usewear. The blade edge itself is damaged with the original surface having been broken/eroded away through time. 

The faces of the blade are plain with no evidence of ribs. The faces are flat and gradually convergent to the blade edge. Sharpening striations are discernible running along the blade edge. The surface is smooth with a medium green patina with areas near the break on one face and on the top side lost to damage, likely from deposition environment, exposing a rough light green subsurface. Traces of shiny black are visible on one side and inside the socket, possibly from tenorite as seen on other contemporary axes.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,95.13,,,21.1,72.6,1,,Adelle Bricking,Wales,Powys,Powys,Glyn Tarell,SN9827,,51.93213301,-3.48494732,NMGW-219CA8,,202152.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dellbricking/202152.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1138360.jpg
1023967,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-700,"An incomplete cast copper alloy spearhead probably of late Bronze Age date (c.1500-700 BC). The spearhead is fragmentary, missing the basal end of the blade and base of the socket with only the top end with tip surviving. The spearhead has broken through the central socket, which is solid, with a diameter of 14.2mm x 12mm). The position of the socket is marked by a prominent, rounded midrib with a width of 12.1 at the break, height of 3.3mm on one side and 4.3 on the other, and maximum surrounding overall depth of 12.2 just before the break. The midrib tapers gradually towards the tip (0.7mm in width and 3.2mm overall depth at the point). Faint lines run parallel to the midrib from the break and appear to terminate c.7.6mm from the point, though they could have run up to the tip and have since been eroded away from surface damage. The surviving blade edges suggest the blade end is triangular in plan and widens just before the break (39.3mm), so was possibly leaf-shaped. The spearhead is slightly bent towards the break (as seen in section) suggesting the object was intentionally bent and broken prior to deposition. One side of the spear has been struck, possibly by plough, with a diagonal groove running from the midrib to the edge of the blade. 



The absence of the socket makes typological identification uncertain. The more commonly–recovered types consistent with the form of the fragmentary spearhead are pegged, of Davis’ generic Group 11 (2015)[1], or possibly of a side-looped type, Davis’ (ibid) Group 6. Socketed Spearheads of Davis’ Generic Group 11 can be dated to the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age, dated by Needham et al (1996)[2] to c. 1200 – 900BC.



The spearhead is an uneven grey patina with patches of bright green, dark grey/black possible tenorite, and orangey brown. The object has a max length of 85.3mm, width of 39.3mm, thickness 14.2mm and weighs 48.72g.

This corresponds with the Acton Park II, and Taunton metalworking Assemblages, that correspond with Needham Period 4 or 5. 



The axe has a narrow, convex butt. The septum and upper blade are of the same thickness and there is no stop-ridge present. The flanges are cast and are a wide pointed oval shape in profile, nearly lozenge shaped. The blade has suggestions of a central ridge or arris on both faces. The sides flare out moderately to form the cutting edge which is convex, but the blade is fairly narrow overall when compared with the larger corpus of similar axes. Part of the original smooth patina survives in the septum, but most of the surface is pitted, corroded and lumpy, obscuring any decoration or facets.

1024893,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1700,"A copper alloy flat axehead of Needham Class 4, dating to the Early Bronze Age period, c. 1900-1700 BC. 



The axehead is lenticular in profile, with slightly flattened edges, and a broadly flaring cutting edge. It is comparatively small with a markedly slender butt, which nonetheless thickens at the septum. This is possibly a proto-stop ridge, as there is a particular horizontal thickening in this area. Both faces show signs of pitting, with some circular areas a deeper green than the consistently dark green surface elsewhere. There is a shallow U-shaped depression in the cutting edge which may have occurred during use. 



Similar examples, albeit with a slightly longer butt, include SOM-90B762 (from the south west), KENT-A2BA81 and NMGW-084887, the latter of which has slightly more exaggerated bevelling.  DEV-987893 is a further local fragmentary example. The record for SOM-90B762 provides an extended interpretation:



This is a low flanged axe of Early Bronze Age date. The lack of developed stop ridge suggests it most likely dates to the later stages of the Early Bronze Age. Needham (1983, 2017) has produced a typology of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age flat and flanged axeheads that defines them based on the ratios of their physical form (Needham 2017, 4, Table 1). This axe meets all the criteria for a Type 4e Axehead and most closely corresponds to a Type 4E Withington form (Needham, 2017, 27-29, 55-56). Needham places the date of this type of axe to between the 20th and 18th centuries cal BC c. 1900-1700 cal BC (ibid 45, fig 16).

1025204,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1500,1300,"A cast copper alloy (bronze) early / primary looped palstave, group I - shield patterned type - of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1300 BC). This palstave axe fits best within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both of which conform to Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.



The palstave is incomplete (recovered in two pieces); when recombined the overall length of the axehead is approximately 160mm. Width is 66.2mm measured across the blade tips and 22.3mm at the butt-end. The width measured across the upper and lower flanges is approximately 28mm. The casting seams are present on one edge only (loop side), but have been removed / trimmed and hammered flat / flush. The cutting edge is crescentic and relatively unworn; the blade bevels are well formed and the tips of the blade show little sign of wear or resharpening. On the upper blade on both the front and reverse faces is a cast / moulded shield-shape pattern. A cast central mid-rib is present that divides the shield evenly in half - it descends from the mid-point of the stop and tapers to an indistinct terminal on the lower blade. The arris also features for a short distance in the centre of the septum where it meets the stops. The loop is relatively small and low; it bisects the stop being broken on the upper / butt side. The two slide flanges are well cast and conjoin with the stop forming a single entity on both edges. In section this is H shaped. The septum is smooth and undecorated. The butt is rectangular and is incomplete; a small fragment of the butt-end is missing; it is most likely lost due to an old patinated casting defect at this point. The axehead has a thick mid-green brown coloured patina which covers all surfaces. There are areas where this is lost a pitted light green coloured corrosion product is present. 



As stated the axehead is in two pieces, having broken transversely across the butt-side of the stops, through the H-section the septum forms with the flanges, and on through the loop. A failure at this location could easily have occurred in use, particularly because the haft termination and sudden reduction of the load bearing cross-section at this point would concentrate the stresses locally. Metallurgically the fracture surface is granular and brittle and although detail is vague could well have contained a casting defect, the propagation of which during use may have caused a fatigue failure;- so explaining the lack of any plastic deformation. An excess of tin in the alloy would also make the axehead overly brittle and prone to failure of this kind. Alternatively given the nature of the landscape in which the axehead was found, it may have been intentionally destroyed in a ritual votive fashion. Bronze Age material is often discovered votively broken, but otherwise well preserved, in deposits close to water around the Fen edge and other similar landscapes in Norfolk.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2019-11-22T00:00:00Z,,,375,,,,160,1,Garry Crace,Garry Crace,Eastern,Norfolk,Breckland,North Tuddenham,TG0514,From finder,52.68488403,1.03148402,NMS-C8BC70,,HERC8BC70_MBA_Palstave.JPG,Middle Bronze Age Palstave,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/norfolkarcher1/HERC8BC70_MBA_Palstave.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1140571.jpg

The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There is damage to both edges of the blade.



It measures 53.0 mm in length, 11.9 mm wide (base), 3.9 mm wide (tip) and 8.3 mm thick. It weighs 10.2 g.

1026963,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A complete copper alloy spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1550-1250 BC). The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval/leaf-shaped blade, with a pronounced mid-rib on both faces. The mid-rib is lozenge shaped and tapers from the tip of the spearhead into the socket of the spear. The socket is hollow and has cast side loops roughly half way up the socketed end on opposing sides. The socketed end is slightly chipped but overall the object shows few signs of wear. The object has a smooth dark brown to dark green patina, which is pitted in places.



This form of spearhead can be classified as Davis Group 6 (Davis 2017). Davis (2017) suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He thus dates these types to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, circa 1550-1250 BC. As such this example has been similarly dated.

The leaf shaped blade is lenticular in cross-section. One surface is almost flat and the other slightly convex possibly with the remains of a midrib. The tang is also lenticular  in cross section with opposing convex surfaces. The surface extending from the flat side of the blade steeply convex and the opposing side extending from the midrib side is gently convex and almost flat. The tang measures12.44mm at the base of the blade tapering to a point. It thickens from 7.68mm tapering to 1.75mm at the tip. The side profile of the tang terminates in a curve with a sharply upturned tip.The object is covered in pale green corrosion, but is a bright copper underneath. 



Measurements: length: 91.86mm; width: 32.78mm; thickness of blade: 7.31mm and weight: 51.75g. 



Discussion: The upturned tang would have held the original wood, bone or antler handle in place. Other similar examples on the database include: LANCUM-0FBC03; LEIC-081BB1; SF5067. See also Watson, P. 1993 no. 76, a razor metal detected in 1986 in Bewdley Worcestershire and now in Birmingham museum (1987.A218.).

1028233,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1300,"A cast copper-alloy flanged axe dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1600-1300 BC. It is probably from Needham Period 4-5; the Arreton, Acton or Taunton metalwork assemblage. There is a lozenge shaped flange on each side of the butt end. The blade tip is crescent shaped but no bevels are visible. The sides of the blade flare towards the cutting edge, and are curved. There is no stop ridge for the handle to butt against, but the blade is thicker than the septum. There is a raised curved line at the haft end of the blade - a shield pattern - on both faces, and within the shield is a central arris running along the axe towards the septum. The surfaces inside the flanges are smooth and deep green, but the more exposed surfaces are extensively pitted. The butt end is damaged, so it is not clear if it was notched (concave) or not. The object weighs 446g, has a length of 151.7mm, a width of 29.7mm and has a thickness of 29mm.

1028545,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A complete but chipped copper alloy spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1550-1250 cal BC) consisting of a circular socket with side loops above which is a leaf shaped blade. 



The spearhead's blade is broadly leaf shaped in plan with a point of maximum width (PMW) placed 14.5mm along its 43.2mm length. Below the PMW the blade edges first narrow in a convex arc before abruptly becoming straight diagonal lines to meet the haft of the object. Above the PMW they narrow smoothly in a convex arc to the blades' point. Both blades have irregular chips missing possibly from damage in the soil, although there are at least two (maybe three) V-shaped chips in one blade near the tip of the spear that may be from use or an act of deliberate damage.  The mid-rib  is pronounced, runs the length of the blade and is lozenge shaped in cross section. the blade is flat beyond the midrib with no evidence of a bevel.



The socket is circular in cross section with a maximum diameter of 14.3mm at its base. The socket contain concreted soil within it. The spear's has cast side loops placed roughly half way up the socketed end on opposing sides. each loop is c. 10.9mm long, thin (2.0mm wide) and has a sub-oval hole. They do not appear to have been hammered after casting having a stringy appearance. Two casting seem run the length of the socket along lines that include each of the side loops. These are most pronounced between the side loops and blade.



The spear has a mostly thick dark green patina that is chipped to reveal a lighter green patina below. There are some lighter bronze scratches possibly from recent damage by the plough.



The spearhead is 87.0mm long, 14.3mm thick at the socket narrowing to c.2.3mm thick at the blade tip and weighs 22.31 grams.  



Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis'  (1909) Class IV which they date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Davis (2012) has recently provided a more thorough typology of Bronze Age spearheads in Britain within this typology this form most closely matches his type 6E (leaf shaped) with a point of maximum width placed c. 34% along the blades length and convex blade edges. While the lower blade edge is somewhat angular similar to those seen on Kite shaped spearheads, these may be warped and are illustrated on further leaf shaped spearheads illustrated by Davis (2012: pl. 34, Nos. 570, 584. 587 and 590). Davis (2012: 108-9) argues side looped forms to The Acton Park Phase (1550-1400 cal BC) with the suggestion that in some areas this use may be extended slightly into the Taunton Phase (1400-1250 cal BC).  A date of c. 1550 to 1250 cal BC is most appropriate (following Needham et al. 1997) this would match Needham's (1996) period 5.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-04-23T23:00:00Z,2021-04-23T23:00:00Z,,,22.31,,,14.3,87,1,Edward Caswell,Edward Caswell,South East,Buckinghamshire,Aylesbury Vale,Steeple Claydon,SP6827,From finder,51.93736093,-1.01228172,OXON-0CE8E2,,OXON0CE8E2.jpg,Middle Bronze Age spearhead,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/edwardcaswelloxon/OXON0CE8E2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1145626.jpg

The fragmentary cast axe is represented by a blade fragment (with a surviving length of 42.3mm, a maximum thickness of 12.2mm and a weight of 65.5g). The axe has broken in antiquity across one face and through the base of the socket on the other face. The socket is rectangular (33.4mm wide). The sides appear to be straight and gradually divergent to the blade edge. Corrosion has removed any casting seam on the sides. The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded (with a width of 42.0mm) but is near-straight and shallow (with a surviving depth of 5mm). The blade faces are slightly convex across their widths but near-flat across the length of the more complete face. There is no surviving evidence for ribs on the face but the surface is very heavily corroded. Traces of a mid to dark green patina are evident but much of the surface has a pale-green active corrosion.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification uncertain. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.

It is also possible that the fragment is from a dirk or rapier. The blade is lentoid in cross-section with edge bevels on both faces. Both ends are broken and the damage does not appear to be recent. The breaks are patinated but not worn. The fragment tapers and has straight edges. The surface has been recently slightly damaged in the centre where the patina is missing. There appears to be post depositional bending in the centre, causing cracks in the patina, which is a blue-green colour where it is undisturbed. The fragment is 103.1mm long; 36.3mm wide narrowing to 27.3mm; 6.3mm thick, and it weighs 117.5g.



See https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/swords. This fragment is probably most likely to be from a Wilburton or Ewart Park type sword but could also be from the Taunton or Penard style phases. Compare WMID-871F5F and YORYM-17D783.



The location of the findspot in the Aire Valley, fairly near to the burial mounds and henge at Ferrybridge, may be significant, and could suggest intentional deposition in a riverine environment, perhpas after being deliberately broken.","
Bronze Age swords are not common finds in North Yorkshire, so it has been made a find of note.

1031192,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"A late bronze age socketed axehead which retains a portion of wood within the socket. The axehead is of a late Bronze Age type probably attributable to the Ewart Park Metalworking Industry, (c. 1000-700BC) with a single sideloop near the socket and three moulded ridges to each side of the blade which run half way down to the cutting edge. There is corrosion damage to the socket end on one side which has resulted in three fragments breaking away; they are however retained (2nd image). The socket is 37.3mm by 44mm and of sub rectangular form with a circumferential ridge around the opening. The blade edge is damaged from corrosion but flares slightly and tapers to a thickness of around 7mm. There are casting spurs along the seams on the sides.



The wood in the socket is soft and fibrous and a light tan / brown in colour. It appears to completely fill the hollow centre of the axehead (3rd image).","
The retention of wood within the socket of this axehead is exceptionally rare and made possibly only by localised anaerobic preservation in a waterlogged context (possibly a ditch fill). These conditions have further resulted in poor preservation of the metal.

At the top of the fragment is the base of the socket of sub-rectangular form (26.7mm x 5.5mm and with a maximum surviving depth of 2.4mm), broken in antiquity. A small length of the sides survive (24-5mm), which appear slightly bevelled towards a raised central ridge, which comprises the finished casting seams. The surviving sides are near-straight and slightly divergent to the blade tips (with a surviving blade edge width of 40.0mm). The original edge blade edge has been lost and is eroded but has a slight curved edge (with a surviving depth of 5mm). The surviving blade faces are very slightly convex across both their lengths and widths. There are no ribs evident on the surviving faces. The surfaces are corroded with a partially preserved dark-green patina and elsewhere has a pale green corrosion.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe, c. 1,150 – 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries.

1031609,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-800,"A copper alloy penannular ring or ring core of probable Bronze Age date (c. 1300-800BC). The ring is made from a circular sectioned loop. The original surface is missing, and green and brown copper corrosion products cover the ring. The blue corrosion product is likely azurite. Objects such as this are often termed “ring money” or “hair rings” but are most likely a form of personal adornment worn on the nose or ears.  Typically dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, it is suggested in NMGW-04216C that they in fact originate in the Middle bronze age and continue in use until the end of the Bronze Age. This means a wider date range of c. 1300-800BC must be given for this object. 



It is possible that this object is a core onto which sheet gold or gold/silver alloy would have been fixed. The XRF results may support this as a trace quantity of gold and silver was detected.



The finder was kind enough to take an XRF scan of this object. While this will not give precise readings of the metal composition it does give indication as to the elements present.

1031731,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"Incomplete Late Bronze Age copper-alloy socketed axehead. The mouth of the socket has become squashed and broken (and the breaks worn). Approximately half of the mouth is missing to a depth of 16 to 20mm. Another quarter of similar depth is detached but extant, while the fourth quarter is in-situ and integral. The detached fragment fits back onto the axehead well, in a position opposite and squashed against the integral quarter. Both parts are thickened at the rim and their shape indicates that the mouth was originally oval.



The axehead is sub-rectangular in transverse cross-section (rounded corners and slightly convex faces). In width, it tapers concavely from the mouth to the centre and then expands concavely to the lateral tips of the curved cutting edge.  In thickness, it expands convexly from the mouth to a point about a third of the way along of its length (mainly or wholly due to having been squashed) and then tapers convexly from there until it terminates in a point at the cutting edge.



The two narrow faces each bear a longitudinal casting seam, and one bears a loop, which is biconvex in cross-section and situated close to the mouth. A small fragment of the cutting edge has been lost from a worn break near its centre. The whole object is patinated bright green. 10th to 8th century BC

Possibly of Arreton type dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 BC.



Description: The axehead survives in two heavily corroded pieces. the blade end has snapped just about 3 cms past the shallow proto stop ridge. It has flanged parallel sides which run from the edge of the blade along the body towards the butt. The flanges appears to be cast rather than hammered out. The blade itself is a wide crescent shape with slightly upturned corners. The flanges narrow slightly towards the centre of the body and widen back towards the edge they are also shallower at each end. The axehead's surface is heavily patinated and pitted with some abrasion along the edges. The break are heavily abraded and likely having occured while in the ground. The corrosion is very advanced



Measurements: 172mm long, 69mm wide, 31mm thick (at thickest) and 500g in weight



Discussion: The axehead superficially seems to fit with the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (Burgess and Schmidt, 1981. 65 - 75). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.

1034706,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1500,500,"Copper alloy (bronze) casting waste of uncertain date; most probably Mid - Late Bronze Age (1500-700 BC). However, due to the lack of context and the continuation of casting styles this artefact could be dated from Bronze Age - Roman period (c. 1500 BC - 450 AD). This fragment is from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould. The casting waste is conical; being oval in plan and D shaped in cross section. In profile the edges of the waste taper relatively evenly. The base of the casting waste is irregular with the remains of two runners / casting jets being present. These jets / runners are heavily abraded. The sides show no evidence of casting seams although they are also similarly abraded. The upper surface is pitted and rough, although heavily patinated: at the centre of the upper surface is a slight depression. This surface is commonly seen where the metal is poured into the neck of the mould and shrinks on cooling. The casting waste is a mid green colour with a slight mid grey coloured corrosion product present in several areas. Casting waste is very hard to date in isolation but the patina and form might suggest a Bronze Age - Roman date. The fact that this mould comes to an oval broken edge may suggest that it was for casting a palstave or possibly a tool; it is most likely to date from the Middle Bronze Age. A direct comparison has not been found. The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting.

1037997,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"A complete copper alloy unlooped and unfinished palstave axehead of middle Bronze Age date (c.1400-1100 BC), possibl of 'South Western type'. Rowlands 'Class 3 Group 2'.



Description:  The axhead has a solidly rectilinear butt which proceeds to flare outwards to the cutting edge. There is a distinct central mid-rib on the blade. Extended raised lines on both sides of the flaring flanges adjacent to the stop appear to be casting marks, which were not removed before deposition. The butt also has a swell on one side perhaps a casting fault which was not cleaned or prepared before use/deposition. The blade itself is triangular and incomplete. The axehead is heavily patinated and pitted due to corrossion. It has a mid - dark green colouraiton with some dark brown patches and speckles.



Discussion: This palstave appears to be an example of the South Western type, which is commonly found across the South West of England in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset. Multiple single examples have been recorded by the PAS, including DEV-01DDC5 (Shipley 2018), DEV-054D5E (Shipley 2020) and SOM-F224AB (Caswell 2019). Pearce (1983: 432-3) illustrates a number of comparable examples in her study of metalwork from the region. 



They are also comparable to those palstaves placed within Rowlands 'Class 3 Group 2' (see Rowlands 1976: pl 2 85 no.3, and p. 247). Rowlands Class 3 is characterised by a U-shaped septum profile, low triangular or slightly convex flanges, a straight sided triangular or crinoline blade and a triangular depression or ribbed motif beneath the stop-ridge (Rowlands 1976: 32-33). Group 1 and 2 within Class 3 are divided based on blade width, being 7-8cm and 5-6cm respectively. This group, having blades less than 6cm in width therefore fit in Group 2. This class is associated with Needham (1996)’s Period 5.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-09-17T23:00:00Z,,,,428,,,27.5,169,1,Mr David Clarke,Mr David Clarke,South East,Kent,Dover,Ash,TR3059,GPS (from the finder),51.28367611,1.29683732,PUBLIC-8AA4E8,,misc3831.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/stuff8472/misc3831.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1154294.jpg

The blade projects from the hilt with a width of c.19.3mm after which its sides narrow gradullay in a straight line to c.15.9mm mm from where it ends in a transverse break which is patinated. The blade is vesica (pointed oval) shape in cross section with a sligthly flattened midrib from which it narrows more sharply to an edge that now has many chips along it.



The surviving portion of the hilt is oval in plan but its unlikely to represent its original from. It is divided from the blade by two narrow contractions.



The object has a medium green patina.



The fragment of the object is 67mm long, 19.3mm wide, and is 4.0mm thick. It weighs 26.42 grams.



Without the entirety of the blade the type of weapon must be general. It can be classed as one of Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group IV: Notched butt weapons with reworked butts, e.g. Nos. 898-950 (Burgess and Gerloff 1981: Plate 110) although other type II and type IV rapiers show modification to become similar to this example. These probably date slightly later than the original weapons, so a date in the later Middle Bronze Age or earlier Late Bronze Age seem feasible. Similar examples exist on the database such as.

Diminutive axes are often associated with Roman votive offerings. However, the axe recorded here is clearly of a Bronze Age form. Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are becoming established. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function. Other examples of diminutive axes can be seen in Needham (unpublished; figures 77, 82 and 91). Other examples can also be seen in Needham 1988, 'Selective deposition in the British Early Bronze Age', World Archaeology, volume 20, number 2, figure 4.

There is a casting flaw leaving a hole in one face of the lower blade. Most of the blade has broken off and is missing, and the break is patinated. The midrib has a lozenge shaped cross-section.

The bracelet is composed of a cylindrical bar (c.5.2mm diameter) that has been curved to become a sub-oval shape in plan. It may have originally been more circular in plan. The terminals of the bar are slightly expanded (c.8.1mm diameter) and are sub-circular in section.  The bracelet is mostly a light green patina although has darker green patches near its terminal.



The bracelet is 68.1mm long, 38.5mm wide, and 8.1mm thick at the terminals. it weighs 20.64 grams



Several bracelets with expanded terminals made of gold have been recorded on the database such as BUC-26FC86, NARC-10B4B1, HAMP-5E48D1 and IOW-65AD93 argued to be Bronze Age based on excavated examples in hoards.

1039519,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"An incomplete cast copper alloy looped palstave of possible South Western type dating to the Taunton/Penard metalworking phase (c. 1400-1100 BC).



The palstave has an incomplete length of 130.3mm and a weight of 394.5g. A transverse break at the butt end of the flanges means that the butt is missing but can be assumed to have been relatively narrow- the width at the break is 23.1mm, tapering slightly from the maximum width at the flanges of 28.1mm (not including the side loop). The sides are slightly convex as far as the high point of the stop and are then straight and slightly faceted before flaring out to the expanded blade. The roughly ovoid/flame shaped flanges are relatively high, being 32.6mm at their point of maximum breadth, reaching this point above the stops. The flanges can be assumed to have been slightly higher originally, as the edges show damage. The septum is c. 5.2mm thick and somewhat concave, ending in rounded stops. The broken loop is very slight, being a maximum of only 5.3mm thick and 18.2mm long. It extends from just above to just below the stops. The blade projects seamlessly from the flanges, with the sides smoothly narrowing down from the above the stops before. The length from the stops to the middle of the blade edge is 85.7mm. The blade is decorated with a single broad, poorly defined midrib on each face which extends from the stops to the top of the blade facet. The expanded blade has an incomplete width of 57.8mm, with one of the blade tips, and some of the edge missing. The blade has a maximum thickness below the stop of 27mm and thins to 11.1mm at the blade facet. The maximum length of the blade facet is c. 14mm. Some possible sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge are visible, although the corrosion and abrasion damage on this part of the palstave can make it difficult to be certain.  File marks, presumably from removing casting flashing, are visible on both sides of the blade.  A single casting flaw is visible on one face of the septum, consisting of a cavity that extends through the stop wall and into the body of the palstave.



The palstave is in relatively good condition, with the majority of the original metal surface remaining, which bears a dark green, brown and black patina. There is corrosion pitting and grazes over much of the surface, some of which expose the metallic core.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,394.5,,,32.6,130.3,1,George Whatley,George Whatley,South West,Wiltshire,Wiltshire,Avebury,SU1071,,51.43791016,-1.85752363,NMGW-F1155E,,2021331.jpg,Bronze Age Palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/gwhatley/2021331.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1156354.jpg

The palstave has an incomplete length of 125mm from butt to blade edge, and a weight of 293.1g. The butt ends in a transverse break at around the point where the flanges meet the septum, the width at this point is 21.5mm. The flanges are badly damaged and the original shape is uncertain. The septum is largely straight, with a very slight taper towards the butt, and is 5.6mm thick. The Flanges form a straight rectangular stop ridge, which projects above the maximum surviving height of the flanges (24.6mm). The palstave originally had a side loop on one side overlapping the stop ridge, now only visible as attachment scars.



The blade is fairly broad with concave edges expanding to flared tips (now damaged, one missing entirely) and a curved blade edge. A slight blade bevel is just visible, being roughly ??mm. A slight raised area running down the centre of the blade from the stop on both faces suggests that the axe had a poorly defined, now almost imperceptible midrib. No other decoration is visible. 



The palstave’s surface is pitted with green to brown patchy colouring- the original surface is missing from the entire palstave with the exception of inside the flanges and on the septum, where it has a green patina. The flanges are very badly damaged, being almost entirely gone on one side, and showing fresh bronze, presumably from recovery damage.

The object is markedly petite, rectangular in shape, and an extremely flattened pointed oval in section, not bulbous enough to be described as lenticular. The object flares very slightly from the butt to the cutting edge, but this is extremely subtle and not characteristic of broad flared axeheads. There are slightly raised flanges present, but these are only present on one surface, and can only be felt rather than seen. There is a suggestion of a slight nick at the butt but it is otherwise complete. The surface is pitted and a mixture of typical green patinisation, soil staining in the pits, and flecks of the original high shine surface. 



The object's slender size implies it could potentially be a deliberately manufactured miniature object, with parallels including SWYOR-6E7AE7, which references the similar HAMP-710DC5, and presents a nuanced discussion of the designation of these objects as chisels, axeheads, or miniature objects. NLM-E45686, recorded as a chisel, is a potentially close parallel, although that record (in spite of the diminutive size of the object) denies that these artefacts are likely of Bronze Age date and suggests a broader range. This may be due to the lack of a tang, typical of Bronze Age chisel forms. Delicate, rather than miniature, flanged axeheads are discussed at length in the record for HESH-FBF348, but this example is distinctly truncated in comparison. For this example, a designation as Flat Axehead is considered to be most appropriate.

Description: The butt end has rounded is rounded. The flanges begin about a third of the way along the butt's length. The cleft between the flanges is raltively smother perhaps from use. There is a significant casting fault in one side of the butt, rectangular in shape. The casting seem is visible along the sides of the axehead, though some effort to reduce it appears to have taken place. The stop is pronounced and overhangs a little which accentuates the wasting effect of the blade's flare. The stop has right-angled corners with the flanges. The loop is on one side which arcs over the position on the stop. The blade is long, thin and narrow and extends extensively before flaring out at the blade end. there is a slight ridge down the centre of each wide face of the blade.



The axehead is has a heaivly modttled patination. Within the flanges it has a dark grey-green patination, towards the butt end and along the flanges it has a much lighter green-white corrosion cause by wear and corrosion. The blade end is a medium mid green colour. There are some areas of historic damage across the blade indicated by their patination.



Total Measurements: 157mm long, 39.27mm wide at the loop (26.20mm wide at stop-ridge without loop, 43.92mm wide at blade edge and 500g in weight

The axehead has high side flanges which are rounded rectangular in profile stepped at the stop ridges. The tops of the flanges on both sides are tall and the same height as the stop ridge. The flanges taper to the rear ans do not extend into the butt. The stop ridges are rounded at the top, and curved. On one side the stop is undercut with a ‘blowhole’ like casting flaw. The butt of the axe head is the most corroded part, but it appears to taper into a straight edge. On one side, cast on the midline of the flange and with the lower attachment point ibeyond the stop ridge, is a low-arched side loop with a sub-circular aperture in line with the stop ridge. The broad blade is a triangular wedge-shape; it flares from below the stop and terminates in a wide, crescent-shaped cutting edge. The front and rear faces of the blade have a low midrib extending centrally from below the stop ridge to about three quarters of the way down the blade; it is more visible on one side than the other due to surface corrosion. There are traces of the casting lines along both sides from the flanges and down the sides of the blade which have been trimmed and hammered flat when the axe was prepared for use. The object has not been cleaned and there are still areas with soil adhereing.

1043972,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axe head of indeterminate type and of Late Bronze Age date, probably of the Ewart Park metalworking phase (c. 1000-800BC). The axe is incomplete, missing large parts of the mouth moulding, the side loop, the entire blade edge, and any potential blade tips. This lack of key diagnostic features makes it hard to place this axe into a typology, but it shows similarities to the South Eastern Type.

The mouth moulding is a simple raised band c. 10mm wide in its surviving areas. The mouth is 28.2mm thick at the mouth moulding and 33.3mm wide, with internal dimensions of 24.65mm wide and 19.8mm wide. Most of the mouth moulding has delaminated from the metallic core and is lost, so the external measurements are incomplete. This loss of material makes the external profile of the mouth hard to judge, but seems to have been angular, potentially sub rectangular. The internal mouth profile is uneven and somewhat rectangular. Both faces are undecorated and smooth.

The loop sprang from the bottom of the mouth moulding, and had a length of c. 19mm, now only surviving as indistinct attachment scars. The sides of the axe are very slightly concave, and can be seen to start to expand just before the sides end at the break where the blade has detached. The width at the point of the break is 31mm. A surviving core of the blade, including the original surface of one face, projects below this point but gives little clue to the blade&rsquo;s original form or dimensions, being largely a metallic core covered in powdery blue copper alloy corrosion. Both of the sides have prominent casting seams/flashings running from the mouth moulding to the break.

The axe retains most of its original surface, which has an uneven green to brown patina. The broken areas are covered by active baby blue powdery copper alloy corrosion. 

While this axe is difficult to firmly place as a South Eastern type axe, it certainly shows typological affinities to examples such as No. 1300 in Schmidt &amp; Burgess (1981). Mark Lodwick comments: South Eastern type axes are often associated with the Carp&#39;s Tongue complex of North West France (Schmidt &amp; Burgess, 1981, p 217), which heavily influences hoard composition in Lowland England. The type is also well represented throughout Britain and is present in the Llantwit tradition of south east Wales, represented within the eponymous hoard and elsewhere.

1044031,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,MODERN,-2350,2000,"Unidentified cast copper-alloy object of uncertain date. It is a solid and heavy bar with four long narrow faces, one of which is divided into two gently sloping facets by a central longitudinal ridge, which may be a casting seam. The end faces and the cross-sectional form are pentagonal, but nearly square: the three unfaceted sides are at approximately right-angles to each other and of similar widths. All faces and facets are generally flat (even the sloping ones). Both ends of the bar splay slightly on all sides, suggesting that they may have been subject to a compressive hammering force.



One of the two sloping facets is raised a little higher than its counterpart. That is to say it slopes directly from the ridge, whereas the latter steps down a fraction of a millimetre before sloping away. This is most obvious at the centre of the ridge; the difference in level gradually diminishes towards the ends until it is imperceptible, perhaps because of the hammering. The higher facet is additionally distinguished from the other facet and all the other faces in that its surface is completely covered in fine grooves, which appear to be file-marks. It also has a single oblique ridge running across it, not centrally, which looks like another casting seam. The file marks on the shorter side of the oblique ridge are finer and equally oblique. Those on the long side are coarser and transverse. Close inspection of the file marks reveals the coarser ones to be composed of two rows of opposed and interspersing long and narrow triangular ridges, with a zig-zag groove running between them. The finer marks are continuous (unbroken from side to side) and near parallel grooves and ridges. There are further fine transverse and oblique file marks visible here and there alongside one of the long edges on the face directly opposite the ridged face.



There are some scratches on one of the other long faces that appear accidental. The patina on all surfaces is dark green. There is no evidence of any breaks.

The spearhead is 90% complete; an irregular tear is present along the mid-rib socket between the two blades. The overall shape of the spearhead is broadly leaf shaped, with a 'flame shaped' blade. Two circular peg holes are present, one on either side of the socket. These have an internal diameter of 6.1 mm. The base of the socket is circular and has a depth of 123.7 mm. Blade facets are visible along the edge of the blades on the undamaged side. The spearhead is a dark brown to mid green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion has caused the original surface to flake away in a few areas, these are dark green in colour. This type of spearhead is consistent with that of the Ewart park phase and a parallel can be found in the Shropshire Marches VII hoard. It is consistent with dating between 950 BC and 750 BC.

1045239,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1000,"An incomplete copper-alloy dagger, probably of Middle Bronze Age or early Late Bronze Age date, c1500 and c1100 BC.



Description: The blade has a narrow lozenge cross-sectioned, thickening only slightly towards the hilt end. The point is missing but it appears likely to have been pointed rather than rounded. The blade is a rough narrow triangle in plan flaring slightly towards the hilt end. There is a slightly raised mid-rib along the blades length. At the hilt end are the remains of two semi-circular or rivet holes, these have broken cross their width, one side has broken more extensively than the other. This leave the hilt end as a rectangular tab below the blade. The hilt end would likely have fitted an organic holt was attached via the two now missing rivets. It has a heavily patinated surface with some copper-alloy corrosion in progress. It remains a mottled mid-light green colour.



Measurements: 68.2mm long, 22.5mm wide, 1.5mm thick (at thickest remaining) and 13g in weight.



Discussion: Due to the incomplete and worn nature of the dagger it is uncertain as to which type or metalwork phase it belongs.

All faces of the head and beak are intentionally slightly convex, one of the faces set at 90 degrees to the spike has a sub-circular rough divot in alignment to the arris on top, this is very likely to be the remains of a second beak/spike that has broken in antiquity, presumably through use. The remaining original surfaces are dark chocolate brown with the recent losses to the surface now mid-green. There are some inconsistencies with the casting on the head, mostly to the side with the missing projection, the other work surfaces are cleaned up a little after casting, but the the angled top of the head has had more attention, it is neatly finished with slight angled scratches to the surfaces from abrasion, presumably from grinding and polishing with some sort of fine-grained stone, there are at least four impressions from a fine semi-circular punch to the larger work surface of the angled head, there appears to be a much deeper punch mark of the same type just below and to one side of the missing beak.

The three biconical gold beads from the Burton, Wrexham, hoard are similar in form, size and weight to the Salthouse bead (PAS-5B1745; Gwilt et al. in Barton 2011). The Burton hoard comprised of several typo-chronologically distinctive artefacts (including bronze palstaves) that allow it to be dated to c.1300-1150 BC (Ibid.).

1046996,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1140,-700,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed axe head of Late Bronze Age date, likely dating from the Wilburton-Wallington metalworking phase to the Llyn Fawr Phase (c. 1140 to 700 BC).



The fragment consists solely of part of the blade nearest to one blade tip, one side and face of the axe, and part of the very bottom of the socket of the axe. The cutting edge of the blade is missing, but enough remains of the side and blade to see that the blade curved down from a now missing projecting blade tip. The fragment measures 24.9mm from the broken tip to the break perpendicular to the blade edge.



The base of the socket is a maximum of 17.2mm from the broken blade edge, and measures 14.9mm in length from the side to the break. A fragment of one face survives projecting 8.9mm up from the base of the socket. The face wall is 4.6mm thick, while the remaining scar from the other wall is 3mm across, although possibly incomplete. 



Only 10.6mm of one side remains, with possible flashing remaining, and a visible expansion to form the blade tip.



The extremely fragmentary nature of the object leaves too few diagnostic features to place it comfortably into a precise type, but a socketed axe like this likely dates to between Wilburton-Wallington and Llyn Fawr metalworking phases. Most socketed axes from South Wales date to the Ewart Park metalworking phase. The way in which this axe has been broken suggests intentional destruction.

1047773,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 11.9 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 21.1 mm (thickness 2.5 mm).



It measures 46.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 21.1 mm, width at the butt is 11.9 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 23.5 grams.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

1048149,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete Middle Bronze unlooped palstave axehead dating to c. 1500-1150 cal BC. It is missing the majority of its blade to an abraded transverse break placed 14mm below the stopridge.



The butt of the axe is c.20.2mm wide, c.3.9mm thick and has a diagonal edge that is straight but worn.  The septum measures c.66.9mm in length and is mostly consistent in thickness along its length narrowing very slightly at the stop ridge due to two small casting flaws on each side. The flanges of this axe begin 11mm after the butt and widen in a slightly convex curve reaching their tallest point (c.26mm) 9mm before the stop ridge from which they are a consistent height. The stop ridge is a very shallow crescent shape.



The blade extends 14mm beyond the stop ridge before ending in an abraded break over which distance it is straight sided. It is thinner than the stop ridge being c.9.9mm thick creating a slight ledge marked by a concave curve. It narrows slightly along its length. The flanges continue along the outside edges of the axe creating two raised borders (flange extensions) which flank a pronounced a central raised midrib.



 Shallow but clear casting seams can be seen running along the middle of the axe down its length.



The axe has a dark orange brown patina that has been chipped in a few spots revealing light green colour underneath. There are some concreted iron pan deposits around the septum suggesting it was, at some point placed within waterlogged conditions.



The palstave is 89.7mm long, 25.5mm wide, 26mm thick if including the flanges and weighs 181 grams



The characteristic features of this palstave are the relatively straight stop ridge (rather than curved), convex and then stepped flanges which begin after the butt and which rise higher than the the stop ridge, and raised flange continuations flanking a midrib decorating the blade. The lack of a blade shape prevents a certain identification however these features are all shared by Primary phase palstaves of the Oxford type examples of which are illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981: pl.58 Nos 788-799).

The object is trapezoidal in plan and wedge-shaped in cross-section with a flaring cutting edge and narrowed shaft. The sides descend from the butt almost vertically then fan out in a smooth curve to form the, now chipped, cutting edge. 



For a comparable example see PAS record LIN-9CD5CA. According to Brundle (2021) 'diminutive axes are often associated with Roman votive offerings. However, the axe recorded here is clearly of a Bronze Age form. Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are becoming established. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III)', 



The object measures 42mm in length and weighs 7g.

The surviving element consists of the cutting edge which is crescentic, and sharply flaring. The surviving fragment has a hollow centre, representing the beginning of a socket. The front and rear surfaces of the axe are slightly concave with multiple sub-oval indentations and there are raised casting seams remaining along each side.  The blade edge is worn, and the tips irregular through use.  while the breaks on the body are also old and worn. The exterior surfaces of the axehead have a mid-green patina. 



Not enough of the artefact is extant in order to determine further typological designation, but socketed axes generally date from the Middle to Late Bronze Age through to the Early Iron Age (circa BC 1300-BC 800). It is possibly of Southern Eastern type, which date c. 900-600 BC.

1048956,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy Bronze Age blade fragment from a spear or dagger. The fragment is broadly rectangular in shape and lentoid in cross-section, with gradually tapering sides. The long edges are worn and uneven, being damaged in several places. The breaks at each end are old, worn and patinated, suggesting they occurred in antiquity. Both faces of the blade have etched decoration along the long edges in the form of four or five linear grooves. The area of the blade between this decoration is undecorated and plain in appearance.



The blade fragment is very worn and abraded. The surfaces are pitted and rough, with some lamination in places.



The patina is mid-green in colour and evenly distributed, with small sparse patches of mid-brown across the surfaces.



The blade fragment measures 33.08mm in length, a maximum of 20.94mm in width and a maximum of 5.56mm in thickness. It weighs 14.70 grams.



Peter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer for Shropshire, suggests that the blade is most likely the tip of a Late Bronze Age (c. 1100-800 BC) spearhead decorated with grooves, or possibly, based on the decoration, a fragment from an earlier object - such as an arreton / Snowshill dagger of the Early Bronze Age III (c. 1600-1400 BC), though these are very rare and thus more unlikely (e.g. HAMP-C13678).","The finder reports that this was found within a few feet of BH-C4785A, which may or may not be related.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-09-01T23:00:00Z,2021-09-01T23:00:00Z,,,14.7,,,5.56,33.08,1,Matthew Fittock,Matthew Fittock,Eastern,Hertfordshire,Dacorum,"Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield",TL0206,GPS (from the finder),51.7434283,-0.5240518,BH-6F439A,,BH6F439A.jpg,Middle to Late Bronze Age cblade fragment,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mfittock/BH6F439A.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1166378.jpg

The object has moderately concave sides and flares from a width of 6mm at the butt to 56mm at the blade. The side profile lacks a lenticular profile and the cross section appears entirely flat; this may be due to the extensive corrosion loss which has also removed any blade edges and sides. A stop bevel may be present, this has again been corroded to the extent where it is difficult to see.

1051152,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1400,"An incomplete cast copper alloy side-looped spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date. Probably of Davis’ (2012) Group 5 A (Wide Blade) of the Acton Park metalworking phase (1550-1400 BC).



At its mouth, the socket has a diameter of 2mm and an aperture diameter of 17.4mm, as well as an aperture depth greater than 43mm (the very end of the shaft aperture is still filled by soil to an unknown depth). Both side loops are present but damaged, sited 14.4mm to 12.7mm above the socket mouth, measuring 17.2mm long by 6.4mm wide and 17.7mm long by 5.6mm wide respectively. The shape of the loop plates is altered by damage and may originally have been oval or lozenge shaped. The loops are cast in line with the blade, and casting flashing is visible between the socket mouth, the loops and the blade. Much of the flashing appears to have been removed by hammering or possibly filing. Two small (one <0.5mm, the other c. 0.8mm) holes are present in each flashing line 12.7-11.9mm below the blade base respectively. The smaller hole enters the socket at an oblique angle and is partially covered by flashing. The size and positioning make it likely that these holes are chaplet holes, remnants of the casting process. 



The socket tapers into the blade until at c.26.5mm above the bade base becomes a lozenge sectioned midrib that continues as far as the tip. Damage to the blade edges has made it hard to ascertain the blade shape, which is best described as transitional between leaf and flame shaped. It has a blade length of 68.8mm and a 35.4mm wide PMW (Point of Maximum Width) at 32.84% up the full blade length (22.6mm from the blade base). The width of the blade as a percentage of its length is 51.45%. The blade is broad based and curves smoothly from the base to the blade edge. The single intact blade has a small concave “step” from the PMW to the blade edge, after which the blade runs straight to the tip. It is unclear if this is merely damage, or is reworking during the spears’ lifetime. The other blade edge is badly damaged, with 36mm of blade edge destroyed above the PMW and a large chunk 12.7mm long by 8.3mm deep gouged out of the blade just prior to or during recovery. The blades are flat and slightly beveled at the edges.



The identification of this spearhead as Davis’ (2012) Group 5 A (Wide Blade) is not certain, but is most likely based on general morphology, especially width of the blade being equivalent to 51.45% of blade length.

1053687,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"An incomplete copper alloy miniature palstave axehead of probable Middle Bronze Age date (c. 1500-1300 cal BC, Acton Park). It is most similar to a primary shield type and the form is similar on both faces of the axehead. The rounded butt is incomplete with one side more rounded the other indicating an area of loss. It widens to form the septum (23mm at widest point). The flanges are high (c.10mm) and rise steeply from part away (approx. 8.5mm) along the septum before terminating at a prominent stop ridge (19.6mm wide, 21mm thick). From the abrupt slope stop the blade narrows slightly (18.5mm) before broadening outwards to the blade tip (32.9mm), and then turns downwards and curves to form the blade which has a rounded cutting edge. The sides of the flanges are plain and without evidence for side loops. The whole surface is corroded and much of the original surface is missing, but it is possible to see the remains of a shield beneath the stop ridge. The top of one flange is torn with a portion pushed inwards and a small area of loss, most likely caused by plough damage.



This is a rare item with only one other comparable find recorded in the PAS database (WMID-EFD2EE). Both examples have clear stop ridges, visible cutting edges, and no evidence for side loops. Other miniature palstaves recorded with the PAS are of different form or material including BERK-602025, HAMP-0FD867 (copper alloy side loop) and SUR-1C249A (lead side loop). This latter is recorded as an Iron Age or Roman item, which accords with the likely date of the many miniature socketed axeheads recorded with the PAS. For an extensive discussion and typology of these miniature socketed axeheads please see Bliss 2020. For this find, the precision of the form and the condition of the metal suggests it is of Bronze Age date rather than a later imitation, which accords with the tentative dating of WMID-EFD2EE. These miniature palstaves merit further research to identify their likely date and use.

The object is comprised of a sub-rectangular tang (28mm long) with notched terminal and single circular rivet hole (6mm in diameter) placed in the centre. The base of the tang widens producing sloped shoulders that have a width of 22mm which then narrow to form the blade.

That artefact is now bent in the middle at about an 80 degree angle. It is unlikely that this could have happened post-deposition or as a result of agricultural machine activity, but rather could be a deliberate act of deforming this object at deposition.

1054399,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1900,100,"Corroded and worn copper alloy axehead-shaped object. Sub-triangular in plan with the corners of the widest end radiused to a curve, with the opposite end terminating in a sharp point. The mid-section of the sides are symmetrically chamfered. Two thirds of the way towards the pointed end, on one face only, is a blind circular hole. It is unclear if this is by design or a defect from the casting process. The form is very reminiscent of a miniature un-hafted axehead coping an early Bronze Age flat axe. However, the sharp point, chamfered sides and rounded coroners at the blade end are atypical, but the cross-section is classically lenticular for an axehead and the degree of corrosion and patination are commensurate with an early date. Miniature axeheads similar to this object can be seen at NARC-B0797B and YORYM-F02231 on the PAS database. However, on account of the aforementioned atypical features the identity is not conclusive. For example if the sharp end of this object was a worn break it could have originally continued to a loop and perhaps functioned as a hanger in a harness pendant. There is scant evidence for being more definitive.  Diminutive axeheads are often assigned a Roman date, but those copying earlier Bronze Age types are also thought by some scholars to be of their own period.  



A record of a miniature axehead that also has a Bronze Age form (see ESS-819206), when contrasting them with diminutive axeheads found in the Roman period, concludes a preference for the BA type having a ritual use in the Bronze Age, and mentions that other examples of diminutive axes ""can also be seen in Needham (unpublished; figures 77, 82 and 91). Other examples can also be seen in Needham 1988, 'Selective deposition in the British Early Bronze Age', World Archaeology, volume 20, number 2, figure 4. These all illustrate the range in size and form of Bronze Age diminutive axes, enhancing the possibility that these objects are in fact of Bronze Age date."" :

1054874,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete cast copper alloy long flanged axehead (developed flat axe) dating from the final phase of the Early to the earliest Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000 - 1700 BC). The axehead is most probably of the axe type Arreton which is dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.



The object has straight sides, a worn butt end and a flared cutting edge with concave shoulders. The cutting edge is broad and crescentic in plan and measures 38.36mm in width. The very edge is worn and incomplete in places The axe has low raised flanges on both faces. The object has a dark brown patina with patches of bright green and light brown corrosion.



Dimensions: Length 85.03mm; width 19.18mm; thickness 10.06mm; weight 83.51g



The axehead is best described as coming from the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 415, 422 and 425). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England.



Similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c.1750 - 1600 BC. A similar example which can be found on the database is NMGW-FDBB88.



Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, ""...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembellished faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature.

1054894,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-950,"A very worn and incomplete cast copper alloy palstave axehead with possible side loop of middle to late Bronze Age date from the period c.1050-950 BC.



The blade of the palstave is sub-oval or tongue shaped in plan. The cutting edge measures 26.39mm in width and is 5.2mm thick. The cutting edge is blunt and damaged. In profile the blade is sub-rectangular and narrow slightly before the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge where ribs might be expected is no visible decoration. The surface of the opposite face is 'clean' and shows no indications of decoration.



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The butt end measures 21.46mm in width and is 3.4mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) measures 45.56mm in length. For one face the septum is prominent with a wide flange. The opposit face has a flat septum and no flange. The flanges may have been misscast or more likely have been lost due to abrasion. It is unclear if a side loop is present due to extreme wear and corrosion.



The object has a light green patina and has arough and pitted surface.



patches of a dark brown surface but most of the axe has a mid-green patina that is roughly abraded and pitted.



Dimensions: Length 109.11mm; width 24.68mm; thickness 13.99m; weight 163.22g



This object is similar to the Type Nettleham axeheads illustrated in Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), plate 67, no 902, espeically if undecorated, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 - BC 950.

1054901,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"A cast copper alloy socketed axe fragment of indeterminate type, probably of Wiburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries and of Bronze Age date (c.1150-600 BC). The axe is represented by a blade fragment only with surviving dimensions of 27.7mm long, &nbsp;max 54mm wide and 12.3mm thick and weighs 62.82g. The top of the fragment has traces of the base socket, broken in old damage. The blade faces are flat across the width and gradually convergent with no traces of ribbing surviving. The remaining portion of the surviving side of the blade is flat, creating a sub-rectangular section at the break. The blade gently flares to the slightly curved edge, which is damaged and missing its original surface.

The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification indeterminate. The presence of a socket base indicates a Late Bronze Age date for the axe,&nbsp;c. 1150 &ndash; 600BC, probably of Wilburton-Wallington, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking industries. The fragment is comparatively heavy, possibly suggesting a leaded bronze, consistent with late Bronze Age and particularly Ewart Park metalwork.

The object is a light green mottled patina with areas of bronze corrosion particularly on/near the blade edge and the break.

The cutting edge of the blade is very slightly concave in plan with rounded ends that slope from a slightly convex top edge. The overall length is 69.2mm and max width is 25.4mm. An irrelgular long notch (11.8mm long by 3.5mm thick) along the top edge may be the point at which a tang or hafted handle had attached, but is now missing in old damage. The notch is off-centre measuring 32.2mm from one end, 39.2mm from the other. (A similar notch is seen on NMGW-B18276). The blade is thickest at the centre (5.3mm thick) and thins to the edges, except at the irregular notch. The opposite face is mostly flat with a slight taper towards the cutting edge and a few striations run along the blade, possibly from sharpening. 



The object weighs 30.06g and the metal is smooth with a mid-green patina. Patches of black possible tenorite coating preserves the top edge. The reverse has some spots of bright green bronze corrosion.

The chisel is in good condition and appears undamaged, with evidence for use wear on the blade edge. The chisel has a tapering rectangular-sectioned tang (50.17mm long), which abuts the collared handle stop. The oval collar measures 12.55 mm x 9.65mm. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in cross-section and flares in width to a thin, crescentic cutting edge 31.08 mm wide. The blade sides are slightly concave. The cutting edge is 27.5 mm wide. The object is in very good condition and has a dark brown patina across much of its surface.

The awl is slightly curved and rectangular in cross-section along most of its length. It is widest at 5.43mm approximately 1/3 along its length, the shorter side narrowing to a circular cross-section and terminating in a sharp point. The longer side maintains its rectangular cross-section and curves slightly downwards, although this may be due to damage rather than design. The shorter, rounded section appears much more worn suggesting that the rectangular sectioned element may have been a tang for a handle . The surface is undecorated and has a mid-green patina.



Measurements: Length, 57.45mm; width, 5.92mm; thickness, 5.48mm and weight: 6.79g



Discussion: Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). Plain copper alloy awls are hard to date precisely but examples of this form are thought to have been introduced in the Bronze Age (2150-800 BC) with most being Late Bronze Age in date (1150-800 BC).

1055260,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,100,"A cast copper alloy 'moustache-shaped' object of late Bronze Age or Iron Age date. The object has a narrowed body with two sweeping swollen drop shaped ends which taper towards pointed terminals. There are five panels of linear grooves on each rounded side, with medial bands running down the middle, flanked by two panels of oblique lines and then two outer peripheral panels of lines running roughly parallel to those along the centre. The tapering lower projections are undecorated. There is a sub rectangular hollow between the projections suggesting the object fitted to something.



A number of these so called 'moustache' shaped objects of have now been recovered, with distinct variants identifiable. They are thought to date from the middle Bronze Age to the late Iron Age. Their function is uncertain, although recess in the body of this example (and in many of the others known) suggests that they were mounted on something, possibly a dagger handle or on the end of a scabbard; however the absence of evidence makes this entirely conjectural.



One example was found in the Salisbury Hoard which contained Bronze Age material but was buried in the Iron Age (Stead, 1998, no.117). Another example was found in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35).","

A fragment of copper alloy socketed axehead of Late Bronze Age date. The find comprises a portion of the mouth, the complete loop, and a portion of the body with traces of three moulded ribs. The 'inside' of the axe has a rough appearance. Apart from the mouth all edges are heavily abraded and patinated in the same dark green as the other surfaces. In places this patination is now missing to reveal a paler light green surface. This is most evident on the reverse break of the body, perhaps suggesting more recent damage by plough or at the time of discovery. It is possible that this item was deliberately broken prior to deposition.

1056499,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed axe head of the south-eastern type (plain A1) of Late Bronze Age date (1000-800 BC).



The socketed axe is sub rectangular in shape, with a curved cutting edge. A slight horizontal collar is present on a couple of faces. There is a single loop on one side of the axehead. The loop measures 18.1 mm in length, and 6.6 mm thick. The blade is wide and crescentic with some damage to the cutting edge. The casting seam is visible down both sides externally but is not visible within. Three domed protrusions are visible inside the socket. The mouth of the socket is square. Internally the socket measures 22.8 mm by 21.8 mm.  The socket tapers down to where the crescentic edge of the blade begins. It is 52.2 mm deep.



The axehead measures 65.4 mm in length. The cutting edge is 38.6 mm wide and 4.7 mm thick. The socket is 30.4 mm wide by 31.9 mm thick. The metal is 3.3 mm thick. The axehead weighs 116.3 grams.



This axehead has suffered little damage and is in very good condition with a dark green patina. There is a wide scar across one surface, it was probably struck by the plough whilst in the plough soil.



Several similar socketed axeheads have been recorded on the PAS database. These include: LIN-C61E83; WREX-5806C1; BERK-2B2982; NMS-5A0D4E and WAW-9DBD6B.",The 3D model has been generated using the mobile phone scanning application Qlone,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,116.3,,,31.9,65.4,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,South East,Oxfordshire,West Oxfordshire,Over Norton,SP3228,,51.94957886,-1.53581513,WMID-5EA8F2,,WMID5EA8F2.jpg,Late Bronze Age: Complete South Eastern type socketed axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID5EA8F2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1174336.jpg
1057538,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-2050,"A complete copper alloy flat axehead dating to the Early Bronze Age (2500-2050BC).



The axehead is sub-triangular in plan and profile, narrowing towards the butt creating a typical lentoid shape.  The parallel sides are relatively straight, expanding towards a curved shaped blade that has a width of 32.04mm.The sides have been slightly flattened to enable the blade to be fixed to a wooden shaft. Both ends have been worked to produce a sharp cutting surface. The surafce of the metal is slightly corroded and pitted with a dull pale brown patina with some pale green patches.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and thus one of the earliest phases of metalworking in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, corresponding to Needham's (1996)  Period 1-3 c.2500-2050 cal.BC, or slightly later.



Similar examples on the PAS database have been recorded under various types, including miniature object e.g. YORYM-CE8933 (59.01 mm), flat axe e.g. KENT-CF6F79 (80.6 mm) and YORYM-D53C89, chisel e.g. SUSS-9B7F13 (65.17 mm) and flat axehead e.g. LVPL-03D15C (61.5 mm).

The spear has a lozenge shaped cross- section with a high mid-rib which tapers towards from the tip toward the break. The socket is conical and incomplete with part of the reverse section being broken (presumably in antiquity). The surviving socket depth is 67.1 mm. The socket has a circular external as well as internal section. The blade extends at the head of the socket and the overal shape is lost due to abrasion all that remains are shallow crescentic fragments. There is no evidence of side loops, although these may well have been lost through movement in the soil. The socket has two circular peg holes, with an internal diameter of 3.4 mm, one positioned on either side of the socket, beneath the blades. 



It measures 96.9 mm in length, 17.7 mm wide and is 18.8 mm thick. The metal is 2.2 mm thick. It weighs 47.5 g.



The spearhead is a mid green to brown colour. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



The fragment is probably too damaged to be specifically attributed to a specific type - however it shares many attributes of the side looped spearheads (of the Acton Park II phase / assemblage) of the Middle Bronze Age as we as that of the pegged spearheads (Penard phases) of the early Late Bronze Age.",The 3D model has been generated using mobile phone scanning application Qlone.,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2021-03-27T00:00:00Z,2021-03-27T00:00:00Z,,,47.5,,,18.8,96.9,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Stowe-by-Chartley,SK0329,From finder,52.85848251,-1.9568877,WMID-0A11D2,,WMID0A11D2.JPG,Middle Bronze Age: Incomplete spearhead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID0A11D2.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1182569.jpg

Copper alloy mount or fitting of uncertain function and date, probably of Late Bronze Age or Iron Age date and possibly a scabbard chape.



The possible cast mount is complete. The mount is of bulbous bi-lobed form with a curving point projecting from each lobe. At the centre is a shallow rounded groove, widest at the base. Both lobes are decorated with prominent ribbing defined by grooves. The lobes terminate in gently curving points of rounded D-shaped section, slightly flattened on their interiors. The points are not decorated and the interior, near the centre is less finished than the rest of the mount. At the centre is an irregular, sub-circular depression or hollowing. The interior is not finished and would not have been seen. The surface has dark green patina.
","See NMGW-AF1FCC for similar. The object, often referred to as a 'moustache' is recognised object form but poorly understood in terms of its function and date. The object form is quite consistent, being bi-lobed and rounded, often with ribbed decoration and with projecting prongs. An example of the type was found with the Salisbury Hoard and indicates a Bronze or Iron Age date although the style would suggest a Late Bronze to Iron Age date. It has been suggested that the mount may have been used on Iron Age weapons and it seems possible that the pronged form may be consistent with its use as a scabbard chape, although this remains a conjectural identification.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,12.43,,,10.5,32.2,1,Philip Smither,Philip Smither,South East,West Berkshire,West Berkshire,Inkpen,SU3563,,51.36499206,-1.49865433,BERK-4644A3,,BERK4644A3.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/pipsmither/BERK4644A3.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1176333.jpg

In database record SOM-D46055 Ed Caswell comments: The missing mouth makes typological identification difficult, Savory (1980, p 55) suggests that the earliest socketed gouges such as those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings, whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).
