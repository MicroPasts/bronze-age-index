1. Spearhead blade fragment. The upper part of a probable leaf-shaped blade with convex edges. The break is corroded. The midrib is round in section, but none of the socket survives. The hollowed edge bevels are fairly broad. Length: 73 mm; width: 33 mm; thickness: 13.5 mm; weight 41.9 g.











2. Bugle-shaped fitting. Complete, two-part bugle-shaped fitting, the two parts being fused together by corrosion. Component A is a D-shaped loop of thick round section with a thinner rectangular staple appended to the flat side. The staple is slotted into component B, a spool-shaped piece with slots in opposing sides and a perforation at just one end. The last is blocked by soil, or possibly clay-core remnant, which can also be seen adhering to the interior either side of the slot. Extremely desiccated traces of organic material, possibly leather are visible through the slot and probably derive from a strap threaded round the staple. Length: 39 mm; width: 35 mm; breadth (excluding corrosion) 13.5 mm; width of loop 9.2 mm; breadth of loop 9.8 mm; weight: 28.4 g.











3. Ring. Complete oval ring, unequal in thickness from one side to the other. Hoop section is also oval. Diameter: 31.5 x 29.3 mm; thickness of hoop 1.7 - 3.0 mm; breadth of hoop 1.4 - 2.3 mm; weight: 2.2 g.











4. Ring. Complete circular ring, unequal in both thickness and breadth from one side to the other. The hoop is of oval to lenticular section. It is fractured across the hoop at a point where there is a radial rectangular perforation, approximately 4 x 1.5 mm; this lies one-third around the circuit from the thinnest part. Diameter: 24.5 mm; thickness 2.5 - 4.2 mm; breadth 2.1 - 3.3 mm; weight: 3.9 g.











5. Amber bead. Yellowy-orange, semi-translucent amber, slightly damaged with chips mainly along one edge revealing fresher surface. Patches of bronze corrosion products are attached. Bun-shaped with faces ground flat or slightly convex and a bowed outer edge. Central near-cylindrical perforation. The outer edge thins on two opposite sides, possibly the result of wear from threads. Diameter: 17.3 - 17.5 mm; breadth 6.2 mm; diameter perforation: 4.2 mm; thickness 6.0 - 6.9 mm; weight: 1.2 g.











6. Amber bead. Light orange, semi-translucent amber, complete with no damage. Spots of bronze corrosion adhere. Distinctly wedge-shaped in profile, the thinnest side also being the narrowest in plan. The offset perforation is slightly oval. Both inner and outer sides are well bowed leaving narrow flat facets on the faces. Diameter: 10.6 - 10.9 mm; breadth 2.0 - 4.5 mm; thickness: 1.7 - 3.4 mm; diameter perforation: 4.4 - 5.3 mm; weight: 0.2 g.











7. Amber bead. Light orange, semi-translucent amber, complete with minor cracks and spalls partially polished out. Spots of bronze corrosion adhere. Near disc form, but of variable breadth and unequal thickness. Near cylindrical perforation, flattish faces and bowed exterior.

Note - Peter Reavill - 18/5/21.



Thanks are extended to Dr Brendan O'Connor who has suggested that this axe form is now better understood after the recent publication of Stuart Needham 2017: The Classification of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age Copper and Bronze Axe-head from Souther Britain.



O'Connor notes: This axe previously suggested as a possible Type Migdale is highly unlikely and although extensive corrosion makes it difficult to be certain where in Needham's Class 4 to place it I believe that it should probably be later rather than earlier c. 2000-1800 BC",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2006-05-31T23:00:00Z,,,,111,,,9,100,1,Jeff Spencer,Rod Trevaskus,North West,Cheshire West and Chester,Cheshire West and Chester,Dodleston,SJ3660,From finder,53.133298,-2.95804,CPAT-5F0B55,,2487-0005.jpg,Bronze Age Flat Axehead,Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/jspencer/2487-0005.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/153804.jpg

The butt has two clear rivet holes both damaged and incomplete but with sufficient to indicate a rivet diameter of 5mm. The tip and butt are both damaged and while much of the original surface survives with a dark brown patina, patches have been lost to corrosion. The dagger is similar in form to a dirk or rapier but its length (127mm) defines it as a dagger. It has similarities to daggers of the 'Camerton-Snowshill' tradition.","

198299,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"An incomplete Early Bronze Age cast copper alloy developed flat axe.  The axehead is 102.23 mm long, with a rounded butt and a body which expands in width towards the blade.  There is no butt stop or transverse bevel visible on the body of the axehead, although the original surface has been removed by corrosion.  The axehead has gentle flanges at the edges of the body, which are concave in profile and are cast or hammered.  In section, one flange is noticeably narrower than the other (the width being a maximum of 10.02mm compared to 11.97mm). It is unclear if this is a consequence of wear or corrosion, or whether this difference was generated in the manufacture of the axehead. The blade is heavily splayed and has a curved cutting edge with a maximum width of 42.41mm.  One end of the blade is worn or corroded away.  The axehead weighs 153.12 grams.  The heavily pitted surface of the axehead has a dark brown patina, and light green corrosion products are also visible on the surface. There is a small amount of recent damage on the more pronounced flanges. No decoration is visible on the axehead.

Cast copper alloy shield-pattern palstave with broken blade and butt ends and a damaged left flange. There is a raised edge, in the form of a shield, from the stop ridge below onto the top of the blade. The right side of the palstave, from the butt end to the blade end, retains the raised casting seam, but the left side is more corroded and has been marked with an incision, parallel to the remains of the casting seam, running the length of the side of the flange. The shiny surface within this etched line suggests that it is more recent damage that the palstave has sustained. The casting seams are off-centre, like the other palstave found nearby, but the shield shape is longer and more pointed, suggesting that the palstaves were made in different moulds. The surface of the palstave is quite pitted and has many raised circular lumps, which suggests that it has been in a suitably wet or corrosive environment to develop such areas of bronze disease.

The axe-head is complete, with an overall length of 105.4mm and a weight of 344.0g. The mouth of the axe is sub-rectangular, with internal dimensions of 31.1mm (depth) by 25.9mm (width). The sub-triangular socket has a depth of 75.4mm. No casting stubs are evident on the mouth but there are broken areas above each face, where the casting stubs may have been removed. Below the mouth (6.2mm beneath) is a prominent and well-defined mouth-moulding giving the axe a maximum depth of 43.5mm and width of 39.0mm. Beneath the moulding is a plain concave collar ending in a poorly-defined moulding, which appears as a slight step on the looped side. The loop begins immediately above the lower moulding and is of D-shaped section (5.6mm thick) with a width of 10.6mm, a length of 29.0mm and has a height of 11.6mm. The casting seams are clearly visible and have been neatly finished, but appear less well-finished above the loop. The sides are straight before they expand rapidly at the blade to produce a crescentric blade edge with a width of 52.3mm. Little of the original blade edge survives but the blade does not appear to be much worn. The axe has a rectangular body section, where the sides are slightly convex across their width. Both faces of the axe are decorated with three parallel ribs beginning at the lower moulding and continuing for 45mm. The face sides are also slightly enhanced to suggested further ribs.

One face has a recent mark running as far as the blade which cuts the patina and was likely to have been caused during excavation.

The axe-head is near-complete and has an overall length of 126.9mm and has a weight of 422.0g. The relatively broad butt appears slightly damaged and is convex with rounded shoulders and has a width of 34.2mm. The sides are straight across the thickness of the axe, giving the axe a rectangular body section. Across its length, the sides are concave and slightly curved. The blade is damaged and the blade tip to blade edge only survives on one side, and suggests a moderately-expanded blade edge. There is the suggestion of a poorly-preserved blade facet, beginning 4mm from the current blade edge. The axe has a maximum thickness of 14.2mm at a point 75mm from the butt. The axe has poor surface preservation and is heavily pitted with a mid-green patina. Where the surface is damaged the axe surface has a pale green colour and has areas of purple, where the damage is deepest. Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefacts was carried out using aCamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The objects were examined whole within the specimen chamber and were analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. All the results presented are semi-quantitative. The results demonstrated that the axe is pure copper, with no other elements detected. The axe has relatively advanced features within the copper axe sequence; the relatively broad butt and the axe being thicker nearer the blade, suggests affinities to Type Dunnottar (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 31), which are some of the earliest tin-bronze axes. The axe form suggests a chronological position towards the end of copper axe types, perhaps dated to approximately 2,200 - 2,00BC.",,4,Copper,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,422,,,14.2,126.9,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Powys,Powys,Yscir,SO0029,From a paper map,51.950472,-3.456451,NMGW-C55A71,,20079.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/20079.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629404.jpg

The palstave belongs to the Acton Park metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. The palstave is complete and is comparatively short with a length of only 119.3mm and a weight of 301.2g. The butt is slightly concave and has a width of 22.8mm. The sides are straight and parallel as far as the stop, with a width at the stop of 28.5mm. The flanges begin from the septum and below the butt. The flanges are rounded across their length and reach a maximum height of 28.4mm before the stop (46mm from the butt). The sides are slightly concave across their height, turning inwards at the flange tops. The septum is straight and has a thickness of 9.3mm. The interior of the flanges and the stop are right angled to the septum. The axe has a thickness of 24.7mm at the stop and the stops have a depth of 8.8mm above the septum. While the flanged area of the axe is of normal length, the blade portion of the axe is unusually short with a length of 51mm. The sides of the blade diverge gently, before out-turning sharply at the blade tips and producing a curved blade edge with a width of 48.7mm. The original blade edge has been lost. The flanges continue along the blade face, forming short ribs (15mm long). The blade face has a central, poorly-defined rib, which is less deep than the height of the stop. Either side of the central rib are rounded depressions against the stop. The central rib forms a central bevel on the face and produces a convex profile across the width of the blade face. There is no discernible blade facet. The axe has poor surface survival and is pitted. Small areas of the original surface survive with a dark green patina, notably at the blade and over the septum. At the blade, sharpening striations are evident running perpendicular to the blade. The axe has recently been coated in an oily substance. It is now unclear whether the short blade is the result of deliberate manufacture, possibly for a specialised function or less likely, is the result of prolonged use and wear.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,301.2,,,24.7,119.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Sian Williams,,,,Llanharan,,,,,NMGW-D73AD4,,2007211.jpg,Bronze Age palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/2007211.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629544.jpg

The axehead is complete but has eroded considerably, and has an overall length of 122.7mm and a weight of 289.4g. The butt is straight and has a width of 23.0mm. The flanges begin from the septum, 11mm from the butt. The flanges are irregular, probably because of erosion, but are oval to lozenge in shape and appear higher on one face than the other. On one face, the flanges have a height of only 2.7mm and would suggest a developed flat axe; while the other face has flanges 6.4mm high indicating cast flanges. The flanges have a maximum depth of 20.4mm and are convex across the thickness of the axe. The sides are parallel and straight or slightly concave for the majority of the septum and begin to diverge at the position of the median bevel. There is no stopridge on the septum, but the septum gradually becomes thicker to a maximum of 12.7mm at 60mm from the butt at a barely discernible median bevel. The sides of the blade are divergent and produce a maximum surviving width at the blade edge of 48.7mm. It is now uncertain whether the irregular blade shape is because of wear or erosion. Both blade tips and the blade edge have been lost, but one side has the suggestion of a recurved blade. A blade facet is discernible on one of the faces, beginning a maximum of 13mm from the current blade edge. The surface of the axe appears poorly preserved with a pale to dark green colour and has recently been coated in a lacquer or vanish. The high flanges on one side indicate the axe to be cast-flanged, the absence of a stopridge suggest the axe is early in the development of this form and suggest Type Balbirnie as an earliest or transitional type of cast-flanged axe.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,289.4,,,12.7,122.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Sian Williams,Wales,Bridgend,Bridgend,Newcastle Higher,SS8883,From a paper map,51.53475898,-3.61615949,NMGW-E927F3,,200734.jpg,Bronze Age flanged axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/200734.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/629545.jpg

202726,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"A copper alloy low flanged (broad blade) palstave dating from the Middle Bronze Age (1500-1150).  The transverse butt is slightly uneven and incomplete.  The septum is flat on both sides of the palstave. Flanges surround the septum, except at the butt.  These flanges increase in height towards the blade, with the zenith at the curved stop.  The protruding stop is positioned over a third of the way down the palstave.  There is a loop between the stop and the blade on one of the sides of the palstave.  There is some visible evidence of casting flashes running down the centre of both sides, but this is rather indistinct.  Below the stop the blade flares outwards towards the curved blade tips which are splayed. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge.  Below the butt, and running approximately half way down the blade, is a decoration formed by a raised “V” with a raised sub-triangular design nested within. This points towards the blade.

The palstave has a dark brown patina. It is in very good condition other than a number of pitted areas of the surface, an incision on one side of the blade, and some damage to the cutting edge, blade tip, and butt.  The maximum dimensions of the Palstave are 138.5mm long, 66.6 mm wide at the blade, and 34.9mm wide across the butt. It is above the maximum weight of the scales used.

Building on work by Smith (1959), Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p128) identify a group of palstaves as Early Palstaves Group III: Low Flanged (Broad Blade) Palstaves.  These always have a broad blade, splaying to a fan shape, and wide at the edge.  The palstave described in this record appears to fit most closely within this category.  Furthermore, within Group III, this palstave appears to most closely fit into the Type Carleton.  These are looped low flanged palstaves with an expanded edge and protruding blade tips.  The decoration is usually a version of the trident pattern, either an all ribbed trident or a long rib bisecting a shield.  A similar example to the palstave described in this record is catalogue reference 829, in Schmidt and Burgess (1981, plate 60), although this has a more distinct midrib than the example described in this record.

Schmidt and Burgess (1981) argue that the Low Flanged (Broad Blade) palstaves were a logical development from the shield pattern and early midribbed palstaves which preceeded them. They also suggest that, based on evidence of hoards, the type were superseded by Smith’s (1959) transitional form.

The axe head is complete, with an overall length of 22.1mm and a weight of 4.4g. The butt is sub-rectangular and convex (8.2mm x 4.9mm), at the centre is a small oval depression (3.9mm long, 1.9mm wide, 0.9mm deep) representing the socket of a socketed axe, similar to Late Bronze Age forms. The unlooped side is slightly concave and is rounded across its thickness. The loped side is more concave. The loop begins 4.6mm from the butt and end 9.4mm from the butt. The loop has a circular internal perforation with a diameter of 2.0mm. The loop is of D-shaped section with a thickness of 1.8mm and a width of 3.2mm. It was possible that the axe was suspended from the loop as a pendant or similar. The blade edge is straight with rounded blade tips. The axe has a wedge-shaped profile and both faces are plain. The surface is well preserved with pale to dark green patina.","Metallurgical analysis was attempted using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). This object has a fine, even patination, and it was not possible to analyse the underlying metal. The results show a leaded bronze, which would be consistent with LBA compositions, but a Roman date could not be rules out by the analysis. Miniature axes have a largely south west England distribution with a concentration in Wiltshire; Robinson catalogues 36 examples from the county (ibid). The axes are problematic to date because of a lack of reliable contextual information. The creation of a cast socket would seem to suggest a Late Bronze Age date and miniature axes have been found near midden sites such as Whitchurch in Warwickshire (Waddington pers comm.) and from Potterne in Wiltshire.

206933,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a socketed spearhead, probably from the middle bronze age (1500BC to 1150BC).



The fragment has lozenge-section midrib which tapers towards the tip, which is missing. The fragment is also broken across the socket, with a maximum remaining socket depth of approximately 7.5mm. In section the thin wings are triangular rather than being entirely flat. The wings terminate towards the base of the fragment, approximately where the socket ends. In plan the wings are broadly leaf shaped, although it must be emphasised that they are incomplete and the cutting edges are missing.



The maximum dimensions of the fragment are 69.6mm long, 20.0mm wide, and 12.7mm thick. It weighs 27.06g.



The fragment has a well developed brown patina, and where this is missing, particularly on the edges of the fragment, the surface has a more dull green/brown appearance.



Ehrenberg (1977, p4) states that bronze spearheads first seem to occur in Britain in the final phase of the Early Bronze Age, when three forms were current: the tanged spearhead; the pegged early socketed spearhead; and the end-looped spearhead. The fragment recorded here is unlikely to fit into one of these categories. The tanged spearhead is not socketed unlike the fragment recorded here. The pegged early socketed and end-looped spearheads have a socket divided from the blade by the curving or V-shaped line of the base of the blade moulding (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p4). The most common and widespread form of spearhead from the late bronze age is the plain pegged spearhead (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p13-15). In most cases the socket has a circular external as well as internal section, unlike the example recorded here. The barbed spearhead, also of the late BA tends to have a narrow ovate midrib, again, unlike the fragment recorded here (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p15). Rather, this fragment is most likely to represent one of the main types of spearhead current in the middle bronze age - kite bladed, side-looped, or basal looped (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p6-12). These types may have lozenge midrib sections, as in the fragment recorded here, with the socket extending beyond the blade. However, as the majority of the object is missing, which would have the diagnostic features, the identification and dating cannot be narrowed down further.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-07-31T23:00:00Z,2007-07-31T23:00:00Z,,,27.06,,,12.7,69.6,1,Duncan Slarke,Duncan Slarke,West Midlands,Staffordshire,South Staffordshire,"Lapley, Stretton and Wheaton Aston",SJ8713,From a paper map,52.714499,-2.193876,WMID-50CAF3,,Lyon BA spear 2 jan 08 copy.jpg,"Bronze Age spear (front, profile, reverse)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/Lyon BA spear 2 jan 08 copy.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/162737.jpg

There is a circular rivet hole in the tang, approximately 4mm in diameter, which is also incomplete. There are striations across one side of the tang, transverse to the orientation of the blade. In profile, the tang expands in thickness towards the blade. There are curved incisions at the edges of the knife, between the tang and the blade, visible when the object is viewed in plan. A midrib runs down both sides of the blade, flanked by shallow and uneven voids. The blade is broadly lozenge shaped in section, becoming more lentoid towards the broken tip. The blade surface is rather uneven with depressions, particularly at either side of the midrib, which are probably hammer marks. There are also narrow shallow striations. The cutting edges and the blade tip are missing. The maximum dimensions of the knife are 53.2mm long, 18.9mm wide and 3.4mm thick (just above the break on the blade). The knife weighs 11.72g.

207765,Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-2150,42,"Cast copper alloy ring, probably a harness or suspension loop. The ring is circular in section and decorated with two transverse grooves of the outside. The remains of a casting seam can be seen on the inside, but this has mostly been polished away. It has a external diameter of 15.8mm and an internal diameter of 8.7mm. The hole is slightly off centre and the wider side is also thicker; at the maximum point the side is 4.5mm wide by 4.8mm thick and at the minimum point it is 2.6mm wide by 3.3mm thick. It weighs 3.4 grams.
Although Bronze Age-Roman cast copper alloy beads with similar transverse grooves are known the distinct and apparently deliberate difference between the two sides may suggest this is a suspension or harness loop rather than a bead. The dark green patina supports a late Bronze Age - late Iron Age date range.

It weighs 62.5g and measures 59.7mm long and 34.56mm wide. 

The date is uncertain, but the turquoise/blue corrosion product has been seen only on Bronze Age material from this area, so is perhaps of a Bronze Age date.

208910,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1275,"Prehistoric bronze metalwork fragments. These items were considered under the Treasure Act (1996). Please see the Treasure report below for further details.


A Middle Bronze Age base-metal group from Ottery St Mary, Devon Treasure case: 2006 T36. Three objects of prehistoric bronze metalwork were found dispersed over a small area measuring approximately 15 x 10m. In addition, a further artefact was discovered in an adjoining field and was reported as part of this potential treasure case.


1. Looped palstave, fragment. Complete blade with part of loop. The blade expands progressively towards the convex cutting edge. Defined edge bevels on both faces, 11-12.2mm from current cutting edge. Broad central single rib on either face. The loop is incomplete, areas of the flange are missing close to the junction with the blade and the end of the butt is damaged. The blade edge is corrosion damaged and there is a small, semi-circular piece missing from the centre of the blade edge. The lower blade is slightly pocked and has patches of pale green corrosion. Mid-green, dull patina. L: 90.6mm; W. blade edge: 58.7mm; Wt: 263.9g.


2. Looped palstave, fragment. Butt end, joins with no.1, above. Trace of looped handle. Casting flashes removed. Dull dark grown patina with patches of iron corrosion and a white concretion inside the flange on one side. Incomplete at butt end and corrosion-reduced flange crests. L: 63.65mm; W: 24.95mm; L. septum: 56.8mm; D. flanges: 35.95mm; Wt: 94.3g. Flange sides are short and would originally have been petal-shaped with a flat edge level with the butt.


3. Casting jet, copper-alloy. In plan, at the top it is sub-lenticular with one pointed end and the other slightly distorted and with a rounded extension. Casting seams on two sides. There is an oblong 'scar' left from the runner (18.4mm long and 6.35mm wide). Upper surface has a constriction on surface and a slight concavity with a copper-alloy concretion at the centre. Dull, dark almost black patina, with small patches of green, copper alloy corrosion. L: 41mm; W: 27.5mm; Th: 22.48mm; Wt: 83.4g. Dimensions (millimetres/grams) L: length W: width B: breadth Th: thickness D: diameter Wt: weight


Discussion The palstave, represented by the joining fragments (nos. 1-2) is of a standard type for the Middle Bronze Age and specifically the Taunton phase, circa 1400 - 1275 BC which is widely distributed from sites in the South-West . No. 3 is of particular interest since casting jets dating to the Middle Bronze Age are unusual finds.


Conclusion The Middle Bronze Age scatter of bronze/copper metalwork represented by the palstave and casting was found over an area of approximately 15 x 10m. A single original deposit or hoard dispersed through the actions of the plough seems very likely. This material is eligible as Treasure under the new Treasure Order (2002) being a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects. This hoard constitutes an important addition to our knowledge of the Middle Bronze Age period in the south-west of Britain. Additional find, also reported: Tanged knife, fragment. Flat, thin-walled blade with corrosion damage on all edges. At base of the handle there are two short, linear mouldings projecting from either side. Part of edge bevel is evident on one side. L: 87.28mm; W: 6.2-17.9mm; Th: 2.35-3.3mm; Wt: 14.3g. The tanged knife fragment is datable to the Late Bronze Age and specifically the Ewart Park phase, 1000-800 BC. As such, and as the tanged knife fragment (no.4) was found approximately 50m from the group represented by nos. 1-3, it can not be considered as part of the group of Middle Bronze Age artefacts (nos. 1-3).

The awl has a weight of 17.0g and has a distorted length of 77.6mm, originally having been approximately 98mm long. The tang had an undistorted length of 62mm and is of rectangular section (8.7mm x 5.8mm at the base of the tang) and gradually tapers to a point. There is no collar or moulding between the tang and the point. The point of the awl has a length of 36.2mm and is of circular section (11.1mm diameter at the apex), gradually thinning to the point. The awl has generally poor surface preservation with a pale to mid-green patina. The awl is difficult to date on form, the patina may suggest some age to the tool although the form is difficult to closely parallel with later Bronze Age types which tend to be slighter and have square sectioned points. Iron Age and later awls are generally made in iron.

209600,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-700,"Late Bronze Age copper alloy tanged and collared chisel, c.1150-700 BC.



The chisel is likely to have a broken tang and has a surviving length of 53.2mm and weighs 36.6g. The tang has a surviving length of 15.6mm and is of rectangular section, which diverges towards the prominent collar (12 x 9mm at the collar). At the collar the chisel has a width of 19.9mm and a thickness of 12.2mm. The chisel blade thins and narrows below the collar, to a minimum width of 16.4mm. The sides of the blade are concave to produce an expanded blade edge with a surviving width of 35.0mm. The chisel has a pale green to brown patina with some surface survival and has active bronze corrosion. Deep surface striations on one face appear to be beneath the patina and may have occurred in antiquity.","Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess 1968, 19, fig 7,2; Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC).



Tanged and collared chisels have a broad distribution across northern France, Britain and Ireland (see Coffyn et al. 1981, 202-203, Carte 7), though there are relatively few examples from western England and Wales. A very similar example with a thick collar and triangular blade can be seen in the large Ewart Park phase Nottingham Hill hoard, Gloucestershire (Gingell 1974, 308, fig 4,22), as well as a single find from Leigh Woods, Bristol (MacGregor 1987, 109, 11.65).

The chisel is fragmentary and eroded, represented by the blade and the remnants of the tang, with a surviving length of 37.2mm and weighs 7.5g. The tang has a surviving length of 15mm and is eroded, but is likely to originally have been of rectangular section with straight sides. The chisel has a maximum thickness at the top of the blade of 5.3mm. No lugs or collar are discernible between the blade and tang.

210639,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"An incomplete Early Bronze Age cast copper alloy developed flat axe. The axehead is 107.8 mm long, with a transverse butt, approximately 21mm wide, and a body which gently expands in width towards the blade. There is a broadly straight transverse bevel visible approximately half way down one side of the axehead. The other side has a less complete surface, and no bevel is visible. The axehead has gentle pointed-oval shaped flanges at the edges of the body, which are concave in section, and are cast or hammered. The flanges are slightly thicker than the body of the axe, and are a maximum of 13.7mm thick approximately half way down body of the axehead. In section, the axehead has broadly flat sides which curve up at the edges towards the concave flanges. The blade is splayed, one side more markedly than the other, with a maximum width of 51.5mm. The blade has a curved cutting edge. The axehead weighs 213g. The surface of the axehead has a dark brown patina, but this is incomplete in parts. Where the dark brown patina is incomplete, there is a light green pitted surface. No decoration is visible on the axehead. Schmidt and Burgess (1981, p.59) trace the development of the flat axe in Britain and Ireland. They identify the trend, ""...from broad, simple, triangular forms with splaying sides and flat, even slightly convex, unembelleshed faces, to increasingly narrow forms, with ever-straighter sides that diverge less and less, approaching and even attaining, the parallel sided form typical of flanged axes. The trend is towards slightly dished faces, the edges of the faces are worked up into slight flanges, and a median bevel is an increasingly common feature. Decoration...becomes a commonplace..."" Schmidt and Burgess (ibid.) explain that these developments were in part a function of changing hafting methods - the knee handle, with forked angled end required a narrower shape to fit snugly between the prongs of the fork. Furthermore, dished faces and raised edges made the seating more secure, and the median bevel reduced the tendency of the axe to be driven up into the fork. The axehead described in this record is similar to axe reference 361 identified by Schmidt and Burgess (ibid. plate 31 and p66). This is a developed flat axe of type Bandon. Schmidt and Burgess (ibid, p65) state that: ""Bandon axes are notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm in length. They have straight, parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge. The butt tends to be fairly straight often with square corners. Raised edges or dished faces are usually present...A median bevel is usual..."" They add that decoration is characteristic of Irish examples in particular, and they show a trend towards proportionately thicker and shorter forms, having much in common with true flanged axes. The developed flat axe is within Needham's (1996) period 3 (2050-1700BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2007-06-25T23:00:00Z,,,,213,,,13.7,107.8,1,Duncan Slarke,Duncan Slarke,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Cannock Chase,Norton Canes,SK0304,From a paper map,52.633744,-1.957108,WMID-143A14,,Flat axe copy 31 1 08.jpg,"Bronze Age Developed Flat Axe (front, profile, reverse)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/Flat axe copy 31 1 08.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/166410.jpg

The axe is of uncertain type, probably of faceted type (Type Meldreth (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 204-5) ). The axe is incomplete, missing the mouth and upper body (with a surviving length of 66.1mm and a weight of 77.3g). The body of the axe is slender (with a minimum surviving width at the break of 24.2mm). The sides of the axe are concave and expand at the blade to produce a moderately curved blade. The loop is not present on the incomplete axe. The casting flashes on the sides are not discernible and the axe is well-finished. The sides of the faces have weak, rounded facets producing a sub-octagonal body profile (with a maximum surviving thickness of 12.9mm). The blade edge and the blade tips have been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 42.2mm). Both faces of the axe are plain and slightly convex across their lengths. One of the faces has been crushed against the other, closing the socket. The damage was done by a bladed tool or weapon, as evidenced by a linear scar (6.8mm long) at the base of a V-shaped indentation.

212529,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"The two artefacts considered here were found in June 2006 in plough soil by Heritage Writtle about 40 metres from an archaeological excavation, as part of that archaeological investigation. The individual(s) who found the items are not recorded because in the case of potential treasure found in the course of a bona fide archaeological excavation, it is the practice to give only the name of the organisation.


The socketed artefact was found on 16 June and the sword blade fragment on 21 June. The discovery was reported to the Essex Finds Liaison Officer at Colchester Museums, Caroline A. McDonald, on 1 December 2006. The finds are Treasure Number 2006 T606.


Items Discovered 1. The sword blade fragment is a short length of blade weighing 11.52 grammes; the lentoid midrib is demarcated by two grooves. Analysis of the metal indicates that it is bronze. Swords like this are known as Carp's Tongue swords because the shape of the blade tip is said to resemble the tongue of that fish. Few complete Carp's Tongue swords are known in Britain. Most specimens consist of scrap fragments imported in that form from the mainland of Europe (Sealey 19915,7 with refs). They were current in the Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age dated c.1020-800 BC (Needham et al. 1998,93,98). 2. Analysis of the metal of the socketed artefact shows it to be brass (an alloy of copper and zinc), not bronze (an alloy of copper and tin). Brass is not found in Britain until the 2nd century BC when it was used to decorate an Iron Age sword blade from the river Thames at Isleworth (Craddock et al. 2004). It remained rare until the Roman period. This object is unidentified and undateable, but it is certainly not Bronze Age and could be well be post-medieval or modern. The Status of the Hoard as Potential Treasure The items in the hoard are of two different dates. The sword blade is late Bronze Age but the socketed artefact is much more recent, and could be modern. It is inconceivable therefore that both items were buried at the same time. Although the Bronze Age sword fragment is ancient, two or more items more than 300 years old are required for the find to qualify as Treasure (as defined in law).

The palstave was broken into two pieces from an old break but the pieces were found within 10 metres of each other and fit together perfectly. The looped palstave measures 166mm in length by 63.6mm (width across cutting edge) by 28.5mm and weighs 449g. The cutting edge is crescentic with a wide edge bevel and is considerably damaged from old breaks. There is a single central linear moulding on both sides of the blade which starts 18.2mm from the cutting edge and ends close to the stop ridge. The stop is squared and the side flanges are high, although one side is more worn that the other. There is a faint casting seam along the centre of the sides of the blade and flange. Behind the stop are three liniar mouldings running from the stop to the butt on both sides. The loop starts level with the stop and is 23.1mm long, the top of it is broken from an old break. The palstave belongs to the Taunton phase of metalworking, dating from c. 1500-1250BC. It has a pale green patina, parts of the surface are pitted and some of the edges are damaged.

The dirk has a damaged butt and is eroded (with a surviving length of 87.7mm and a weight of 22.5g). The butt has been formed by hammering to thin the end (with a minimum thickness of 1.5mm) and to define a sub-triangular facet, with hammer-marks discernible on both faces. The sides of the butt have been hammered from the sides (giving a width of 16.7mm) and therefore the shoulders widen slightly to the blade (with a width of 19.6mm). There is no surviving evidence for any rivet-holes on the butt. The blade is of rounded, low-oval section (with a maximum thickness of 4.0mm before the butt). There is the suggestion of a weak mid-rib, discernible only on one face. The blade sides are convex (giving a maximum surviving width of 19.9mm). Concave blade facets (with a surviving width of 3.7mm) are evident and the blade edges have been lost. The dirk has good surface preservation with a mid to dark-brown patina.

The date of the awl is uncertain. Awls can date to the Bronze Age. Needham (in Longley, D. & Needham, S 1980 ‘Runnymede Bridge 1976: Excavations on the site of a Late Bronze Age settlement’, Surrey Archaeological Society Volume 6, page 19.) discusses awls and comments they cannot be dated with accuracy within the Bronze Age period as they are found in Early Bronze Age contexts, such as graves as well as Middle and Late Bronze Age hoards. Barber (Barber, M. 2003 Bronze and the Bronze Age: Metalwork and Society in Britain c. 2500 – 800 BC. Tempus) comments that awls are commonly found in graves and their function may not just have been utilitarian. Coombs (Coombs, 2001 in Pryor, F. The Flag Fen Basin: Archaeology and Environment of a Fenland Landscape English Heritage: Swindon p. 287-288) comments that they may represent varying stages of a craftsperson’s apprenticeship or skill. However this awl has not developed the heavy patina associated with Bronze Age awls.

213429,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,42,"Cast copper-alloy unidentified object of a known type usually referred to as 'moustache-like' or 'moustache shaped'. These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material.

The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper part. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the base, which come to a halt about half way along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end. Other hollow examples include: WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. The opening is a maximum of 7.5mm in diameter. Like this object WILT-0C9A63 and NMS-0F4645 also have two rivet holes, one each side of the opening; on this piece they are 1.7mm in diameter. These holes are not seen on complete examples and may suggest repairs or a variation in design.

Due to the surface corrosion it is not possible to be certain that this item is incomplete, the opening has a rough surface but that could be due to casting rather than an old break. Based on other known examples (e.g. SF-520513) it would appear that this item actually represents under half of the original. The whole should comprise of two of these pointed ovals bridged in the middle with a hole through the centre of this bridge. This form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings. The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion. 

This item measures 29.6mm in length, has a maximum width of 11.8mm and a thickness of 11.2mm.

213510,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"Small looped copper alloy palstave with a plain blade, curved cutting edge and pronounced square stop-ridge. This example was found using a metal detector.

The palstave is complete, although it has been eroded around the edges, and the full extent of the cutting edge has worn away.  Patches of the original surface remain, although the majority of this appears to have flaked away, leaving a more rough-textured surface c. 1mm below.  The patina is largely greenish in colour, although the remaining sections of original surface have a more brownish tinge.  The current appearance of the patina differs with the initial photographs of the find taken at the time of discovery, and this is probably connected to the apparent application of a waxy substance to the surface of the palstave.  Where the rough-textured surface has also been lost, around the cutting edge, the loop and the butt, the inner material of the palstave is an orange-brown colour.  It appears that it has been subject to some surface abrasion, in places, revealing the bronze colour beneath.  

The palstave was cast-in-one, as evidenced by a line visible around the sides, showing the junction of the two moulds.  The sides run roughly parallel until the blade begins to flare out roughly two thirds of the way along from the butt, although the stop-ridge causes a slight protrusion on either side (excluding the loop).

Although it is also reminiscent of the Guilsfield type, the palstave appears to belong to the Wilburton phase of metalworking, also known as Needham’s period 6 (1150-950 BC), due to the way in which the flanges run into the septum before the butt.  Savory notes that “At the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, the north Wales industry seems to have specialised in neatly cast, plain-bladed implements with a straight or curving stop-ridge…”. This palstave forms part of this tradition.

Similar (albeit larger) examples were found as part of the Guilsfield hoard (Savory, 1980, fig 32, no 268.2), and also more recently at Pen yr Ole Wen, Gwynedd, in 2005 (GAT PRN 24018;PAS ID GAT-C5BC97)",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2006-11-02T00:00:00Z,,,,221.9,,,26.5,100,1,Nina Steele,Nina Steele,Wales,Conwy,Conwy,Caerhun,SH7773,From a paper map,53.239735,-3.844521,GAT-9006E0,,PRN_24117-002.JPG,Looped Palstave,Gwynedd Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/nsteele/PRN_24117-002.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/169382.jpg

216838,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed spearhead, probably from the middle bronze age (1500BC to 1150BC).



The fragment has lozenge-section midrib which tapers towards the tip, which is missing. The fragment is also broken across the socket, which has a circular internal section, and tapers to a point approximately 35mm from the broken base of the socket. In section the thin wings are triangular rather than being entirely flat. The wings terminate towards the base of the fragment, but the damage to the surface of the spearhead means that it is unclear if this is due to loss of material. In plan the wings are broadly leaf shaped, although it must be emphasised that they are incomplete and the cutting edges are missing.



The maximum dimensions of the fragment are 70.5mm long, 17.8mm wide, and 10.3mm thick. It weighs 21.49g.



The fragment has a well developed green patina, and on the substantial areas where the original surface is missing, particularly on the edges of the fragment, there is has a duller green/light green pitted appearance.



There are distinct shallow grooves running down all of the original surfaces of the spearhead. These are patinated suggesting that these were not made recently. Ehrenberg (1977, p4) states that bronze spearheads first seem to occur in Britain in the final phase of the Early Bronze Age, when three forms were current: the tanged spearhead; the pegged early socketed spearhead; and the end-looped spearhead. The fragment recorded here is unlikely to fit into one of these categories. The tanged spearhead is not socketed unlike the fragment recorded here. The pegged early socketed and end-looped spearheads have a socket divided from the blade by the curving or V-shaped line of the base of the blade moulding (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p4). The most common and widespread form of spearhead from the late bronze age is the plain pegged spearhead (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p13-15). In most cases the socket has a circular external as well as internal section, unlike the example recorded here. The barbed spearhead, also of the late BA tends to have a narrow ovate midrib, again, unlike the fragment recorded here (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p15). Rather, this fragment is most likely to represent one of the main types of spearhead current in the middle bronze age - kite bladed, side-looped, or basal looped (see Ehrenberg, 1977, p6-12). These types may have lozenge midrib sections, as in the fragment recorded here, with the socket extending beyond the blade. However, as the majority of the object is missing, which would have the diagnostic features, the identification and dating cannot be narrowed down further.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,2008-02-01T00:00:00Z,,,21.49,,,10.3,70.5,1,Duncan Slarke,Duncan Slarke,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Huntington,SJ9613,From a paper map,52.714643,-2.06065,WMID-103158,,Palmer BA spear copy2.jpg,"Bronze Age spear (front, profile, reverse)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dslarke/Palmer BA spear copy2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/172721.jpg

221126,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,,,"This is an interesting example of an Iron Age Socketed Axehead in copper alloy from cica 750 – 600 BC.  In style, it fits with the characteristics of the Sompting type and the Llyn Fawr Phase.  The axe is wedge shaped in both plan and profile view, with an ovoid socket.  There is a marked single strengthening collar to the mouth of the socket with the attachment loop being just below that collar, on the side seam of the axe. 

There are pronounced moulding seams running from the mouth to the blade tips on each side.  The blade tips are slightly flared.  There is also a slight ‘chamfer', noticeable to each corner from the socket mouth, tapering down toward the blade.

The overall condition of the axe is poor, with considerable loss of the original surface, that which is left has a dull brown patina.  One side of the axe has been damaged and split, presumably in antiquity, that damage reveals how thin the walls of this axe are.  The apparent fragility of this moulding might explain the lightness of this axe at just 175 gms.

Another interesting feature of this axe is the internal moulding, which extends into the flare of the axe head.  That in turn, might suggest the possibility of reducing the metal content to a minimum, in conjunction with the thin walls.  Could this type of manufacture, with its lack of overall mass, indicate a more 'votive' aspect, than a practical tool?",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2008-01-19T00:00:00Z,,,,175,,,37,106,1,Rod Trevaskus,Rod Trevaskus,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Wem Rural,SJ4631,From finder,52.873748,-2.803734,CPAT-79CD04,,2456-0054r.jpg,"Iron Age, Socketed Axe Head, ",Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2456-0054r.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/177654.jpg

225265,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-800,"A complete cast copper-alloy socketed axehead dating from the late bronze age. In plan, the axe has concave sides, a convex cutting edge and a mouth with a rounded collar with a single moulding below it. The end of the mouth is not flat; there are two crests at about the central point on either face. There is a loop on the haft end of one side of the body. When viewed in profile, the axe can be seen to be broadly triangular in shape, with the front and reverse faces being slightly convex. The mouth of the axe is sub-square with rounded corners, almost circular, although towards the cutting edge the socket and the axe are rectangular in section. The socket extends approximately 62mm into the axe. There is a plug of earth within the socket which can be freely removed. Two ridges run down the upper portion of the socket, at about the centre of the front and reverse of the axe. A casting seam runs down both sides of the axe. There are some slightly raised areas on the surface of the axe with a lustrous smooth brown patina. But generally the axe has a slightly pitted brown surface, with a few small areas where green corrosion products are visible. There are transverse grooves/striations and some crazing visible on the surface of the lower blade, particularly on one face of the axe. There is a slight depression on both faces on the body of the axe. The cutting edge is complete and remains sharp. There is a small amount of recent damage on the collar and edge of one face where the surface has been removed revealing the yellow/gold colour of the metal. The axe is in excellent condition overall. The axe is 98.9mm long. The cutting edge is 39.8mm wide and the mouth is 36.6mm from side to side, and 35.3mmm from front to back (maximum external dimensions). The axe has a mass of 183.8g excluding the plug of soil in the socket. The axe recorded here is similar to south-eastern socketed axes identified by Scmidt and Burgess (1981, p. 212-6, and plate 85), particularly axes 1275-1279 which are Variant Bilton (described as Variant Worthing on Plate 85). Schmidt and Burgess (ibid, p. 212) comment that the south-eastern type of socketed axehead is, ""...characterized by a fairly slender, square to rectangular-sectioned body with a squarish mouth.""

225556,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1400,"The tip only of a copper alloy spear dating from the Middle Bronze Age, circa 1500-1400BC. The fragment is triangular with a sharp point at the tip. It is 63.8mm long, 27mm wide and 7.9mm thick. There is a central ridge along the blade which is slightly rounded. The section is thus a vertical oval with tapering side flanges rather than a lozenge shape. Near the break there are grooves on the central ridge forming an arrow pointing towards the tip. These are on both sides. These mouldings are quite unusual. Similar decoration is known on some Bronze Age and Iron Age transition pieces. An example with similar mouldings is from the Melksham Hoard and is held by Devizes Museum, but a middle Bronze Age date is considered to be the most likely for this example.. The broken end does not have a good a patina as the rest of the object, but the break does not seem to be recent. The rest of the object has a glossy golden brown patina with a few pits of corrosion.

226015,Wedge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An unusual cast copper alloy / bronze wedge or possibly chisel formed from the recycled lower (blade) section of a looped palstave possibly decorated with a central rib. The palstave would date from the middle Bronze Age; however, it is difficult to say when it was made into a wedge. It is likely that this was done during either the later Middle Bronze Age or Late Bronze Age (1500-800 BC). The blade has been broken or deliberately trimmed at the junction point between the blade and the raised flanged stop ridge. It is difficult to ascertain more detail as the broken end has been repeatedly hammered and damaged through use as a 'cold?' chisel. In Plan the wedge is broadly sub-rectangular and is sub-triangular in cross section. The wedge measures 70.6mm length, has a maximum width of 33mm and maximum thickness of 18.1mm. It weighs 149.78 grams.






The blade of wedge extends from a relatively narrow point, just below the break (stop ridge), and expands with regular straight sides to a much worn convex cutting edge. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the break. The thickness of the blade tip is 4.1mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 16.6mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 18.1mm). Beneath the break, is slight evidence of a raised tapering central rib. This rib is very slight and only shows in oblique light, it has been much eroded on both faces. The convex cutting edge is asymmetric and heavily worn with almost all the original blade bevel being lost. It seems that the cutting edge has been reset as the shape of the blade is very flat (by this I mean that the angle the two blade facets make is very low meaning that the two edges have been heavily worn and reshaped). The broken end of the wedge has been repeatedly struck with a blunt tool (hammer) which has flattened the metal, distorting the break and spreading the bronze laterally to form flared surface. To one side is a small sub-circular projection, which has been hammered / flattened. This is the remains of a side loop which would have projected from below the stop ridge and extended to a point on the mid -point of the axe. The loop would have aided hafting. The stub measures 7.9mm length, 7.1mm width.






The wedge is a mid green brown colour with an even but abraded patina which covers all surfaces. There is some evidence of erosion caused by movement in the ploughsoil; however, this is limited and minor. There is no evidence of active corrosion on wedge and all surfaces seem stable. A direct parallel for this sort of recycling / re-use have not been found, however, it is likely that this type of recycling is not uncommon. The majority of broken tools would have been recycled for their metal contact and so this may be a rare example of this form of temporary reuse which was at one point common place. The age of the reuse is difficult to ascertain, however it is likely to date from the period the axe was made or shortly thereafter. A broad period of Middle - Late Bronze Age is suggested 1500-800 BC, however it is most like to date from the period (1400-1000BC)",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,,,,,149.78,,,18.1,70.6,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Cockshutt,SJ4330,,52.86444918,-2.84812465,HESH-098032,,HESH-098032_detail6.jpg,Bronze Age: Wedge or possible chisel formed from reused looped palstave,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-098032_detail6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/277737.jpg

This suggests that it wasn't made particularly well as the clay moulding placed at the centre of the cast wasn't central when the bronze was poured, resulting in a lopsided socket and one side being thicker. Viewed from the side, the blade is a steep 'V'-shape. The blade surface consists of a number of scratches on one side, where the other side is far too patinated to assess. The surfaces are generally covered in a thick mid-brown patina, with one side still showing the copper alloy surface. It measures 34.90mm x 39.83mm x 14.46mm, weighing 55.76g.

Hoard Content: spear blade tip and socketed axe blade.











Hoard Catalogue











1. The socketed axe fragment is the blade end of the tool. It has expanded blade tips and the casting seams are still apparent along the sides. The blade itself is blunt and there is a profusion of scratches (some of them deep) on the pitted surface. Length 38 millimetres; width 45.5 millimetres; weight 60.18 grams.











2. The spear blade tip has a deep and prominent midrib; both sides of the blade are still present. What might conceivably be the start of the socket is visible at the lower (broken) end of the midrib. The edges of the blades are blunt, having been completed destroyed by corrosion. The rest of the surface is pitted with many scratches. Length 26.3 millimetres; width 13 millimetres; weight 3.78 grams.











Hoard Weight











63.96 grams (before conservation).











Date











There is nothing chronologically sensitive about the hoard components. Socketed axes appear in the middle Bronze Age Taunton phase (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 172-3), which began c. 1500 BC (Needham et al. 1998, 85). But they are not found in any numbers in Essex until later when find numbers peak in the c. 1020-800 BC Ewart Park phase of the late Bronze Age. Theoretically the axe might belong to the c. 800-600 BC Llyn Fawr phase but metalwork of that period is almost unheard of in the county (Cuddeford and Sealey 2000, 15; O'Connor 2007, 64). The only Llyn Fawr axe known to the writer from Essex is a solitary bronze Sompting axe from Walthamstow published as a drawing in the frontispiece to Hatley (1933). Technically therefore the High Laver 2 hoard should be assigned to the broad period c. 1500-600 BC, although the likelihood is that it belongs to the c. 1020-800 BC Ewart Park phase.











An Interpretation of the Finds and Their Status as Potential Treasure











The items catalogued here are bronze or copper-alloy (although no scientific metallurgical analyses of the finds have been undertaken) and were found together the same field. Bearing in mind their date and the fact that both items were found together in direct association and therefore constitute a hoard, there is a prima facie case for considering the find to be treasure, as defined in law.

One end narrows to a diagonal blade, the other is broken (the break is patinated) but is also narrowing to a blade or curved end. 
Many Bronze Age awls have been found in excavations and by detectorists, they tend to have a square section in the middle but normally narrow more sharply than this example and have circular sectioned terminals, or one circular sectioned end to allow them to be turned during use (see, for example, the selection published in Piggott (1964), p.113). It is not clear this example would work as an awl without that circular section but it could be some other woodworking or engraving tool of Bronze Age or later date.

These artefacts therefore represent additions to the original hoard. The biconical bead is of identical form and similar dimensions to three other examples within the hoard. In Britain and France, good parallels may be found in Middle Bronze Age contexts (1400-1100BC). The gold wire was found attached to the biconical bead, the flattened hook terminal being held inside the interior of the bead. This object is hard to parallel, however its terminals resemble hook and clasp terminals on cuff armlets and ribbon torcs of gold, which date to between 1600-1300BC.

The sheet strip has been carefully folded over, to give an oval shaped cross-section, the internal edges around the interior diameter being separated by a gap of 1-1.5mm.

This ring finds parallel with both penannular gold rings and 'hair-rings' of the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1400-800BC), which are now generally thought to be either hair or ear adornments. Rings of twisted bar or circular rod construction tend to date to the Middle Bronze Age, while 'hair rings' covered with gold foil, electrum wire or plating are most common during the Late Bronze Age. This example may represent the transition between solid gold and foil construction, therefore as a potentially early example of a 'hair-ring', could date to as early as the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC). Semi-quantitative analysis of the ring indicates a very high gold composition, with a small percentage of silver and 1% copper.

Description of object



1. Twisted gold penannular gold bracelet fragment. The bracelet is made on a rectangular-sectioned (4.1mm x 3.1mm) bar and has a plain unexpanded terminal. The edges and corners of the terminal are sub-rounded. The bracelet is twisted, giving the body of the bracelet a (concave-sided) lozenge-shaped profile. The bracelet has a comparatively loose twist (of 180 degrees on the fragment) and approximately one-third of the original length is represented. The break would appear to have been cut through a little over half the thickness and bent or twisted through the remainder. The curvature on the bracelet fragment is likely to be similar to the original.



Length - 40.0mm (Approximate straightened length - 58mm); Width- 4mm;Thickness - 3.1mm; Wt. 10.2g



Discussion



The penannular bracelet is of bar-twisted type characteristic dating to c. 1300-1100 BC known in Ireland and Britain. Eogan (1994, p50) classifies the form of bar bracelet as type iii. The bracelet fragment can be closely paralleled with two complete examples found at Saintjohns, Co. Kildare (Eogan, 1994, p 63, fig 27B 2-3, plate XII, Taylor 1980 ref. CoKd 9-10). Twisted gold bracelets and torcs have been found in fields in Wiltshire and throughout southwest England though they have tended to be deposited with accompanying gold objects (Roberts 2007).



Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefact was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The object was examined whole within the specimen chamber. The percentages presented are semi-quantitative only. Analysis suggests that the metal is composed of c. 86% gold and 12% silver. The composition is broadly consistent with Middle Bronze Age gold-working.","Previous Entry

254587,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,1100,,"Here we have a near complete Bronze Age socketed axehead circa 1100BC with unusually clean lines not unlike the South-Eastern class A.  The mouth of the socket is sub-rectangular with a single square form moulding at the top edge, beneath that is an attachment loop, now broken.  In plan view, the axe has parallel sides that are then subtly flared to give the blade form.  The blade edge appears worn and is now showing signs of corrosion.


The lower surfaces of the blade have scratches perpendicular to a cutting action and to one side.

255461,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-950,-750,"Bronze Age sword from the Ewart Park Phase, dating from c.950-750 BC.

It is mostly complete although the hilt has broken at the shoulder so the grip and finial are missing. The blade length appears complete although the tip is flattened rather than pointed which suggests the very end is missing. The edges of the blade are uneven all the way around where small pieces have broken off. 

The blade widens from the tip, reaching its widest point at mid-blade. It then begins to narrow to the waist. It widens slighly again to meet the hilt section. The section between the waist and the shoulder has a narrowing of the blade then a sub-trianglular section. This section would have led into the grip but it has broken before it reaches here. There are two circular rivets on this section, one on either side. The sword has broken just after the rivets.

The sword has an unven light green patina with patches of darker green and brown. It has some corrosion in patches on the surface. The hilt in particular has a lot of corrosion on.

In addition to being cut, the ring has been damaged due to bending, with two of the wires separating from the rest and bending at different angles. This damage indicates that the coils were probably heated and then pressed together along their lengths, as there is a slight flattening of the coils along the lengths revealed.

255964,Pestle,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-2100,-700,"Coarse-grained gabbro cobble with heavy use as a pestle around most of the perimeter (Henrietta Quinnell forthcoming). The pestle is round in plan, with two rounded sides, and plano-convex in section. The pestle is flat and smooth on the face that was used for rubbing, and more convex on the opposite face, where it was held and pushed across a base or mortar for grinding. The gabbro is a coarse-grained variety, probably from Cudden Point, Perranuthnoe, about 4 miles across Mounts Bay (Jens Andersen pers comm), containing pale pink felspars and dark grey pyroxene inclusions. The soft felspars would work into hollows and the hard pyroxene, as a silicate mineral, would stand proud of the surface, thus allowing a shearing action to cut and grind the grain. The shape of the pestle suggests that it was made from a beach cobble. Jones (2002) illustrates a similar example excavated from Callestick on page 29, Fig.13, No.95 which is dated to the Later Bronze Age, c.1100-700 BC.

256038,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,POST MEDIEVAL,-1500,-1150,"Cast bronze (copper alloy) side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of Middle Bronze Age date (1500 - 1150 BC). The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade. The hollow socket is near complete with a small area of relatively modern damage at the base. Two single cast ‘string’ side loops  are present, one on either edge. The spearhead measures 102.5mm length, has a maximum width (across base of socket) 15.5mm and maximum thickness of 15.4mm (across same place). The depth of the socket is 75.9mm. The spearhead weighs 30.21 grams. 

The tip of the spearhead is complete however the side blades have been much abraded in the soil, loosing most of their shape and also the cutting edges. However, the overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The surviving width of the blade is 14.8mm. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib, which projects further on one face than the other. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear and is best described as being conical in shape. At the mouth of the socket it has a diameter of 15.5mm and a thickness of 1.5mm. The base of the socket is feathered by abrasion. The central raised line of the mid-rib does not extend into the socket as a decorative feature. Positioned approximately 1/3 of the length of the socket parallel with the blade are two oval shaped string loops. The loop has a maximum length of 10.4mm, width 2.6mm, and thickness of 1mm. The internal diameter of the loop measures 4.2mm x 2mm. The cross section is lentoid. Both loops are filled to some extent with an orange corrosion product, probably an iron pan, due to the burial conditions. These loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams on either edge of the spear have trimmed and hammered flat. 

The spearhead is a mid-brown green colour with an even but much corroded patina. The patina has been abraded in several areas and there are several areas with an unstable surface. Some of these unstable surfaces have been caused by corrosion, which has caused the metal to laminate slightly. There are a number of concreated areas of iron staining, probably due to burial conditions. There is no evidence for the preservation of organic material within the socket. 

Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham’s Period 5 (c. 1500 – 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,,,,,30.21,,,15.4,102.5,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,West Midlands,Shropshire,Shropshire,Wem Rural,,,,,HESH-C348E5,,HESH-C348E5_5.jpg,Middle Bronze Age: Looped and Socketed Spearhead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-C348E5_5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/274840.jpg
