645998,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe of South Wales (Stogursey) Type, of Ewart Park Metalworking Industry, dating to Needham's Period 7 (c. 950 - 750BC).



The axe is fragmentary and distorted, represented by a mouth fragment, comprising part of one face and the looped side (with a surviving length of 44.1mm and a weight of 62.7g). The mouth (with a distorted width of 56.4mm and a surviving depth of 26mm) is flat topped (6.4mm - 9.4mm wide) and two casting runner stubs are evident on the surviving side and face. There is a mouth moulding, bevel to the face (6.8mm long). The loop springs from the base of the moulding and returns immediately above the break (with a length of 32mm and an internal length of 17.4mm). The loop is broken (with a surviving height of 9.6mm) and appears to have broken more recently. The casting seam is clearly discernible below the loop but has been neatly finished. The surviving side fragment is slightly concave across its length and across its width, is bevelled towards the centre, which would have produced a sub-hexagonal body section. The surviving face is decorated with three ribs, which are near-parallel or slightly converging. The face has been battered below the mouth, damaging the mouth moulding and distorting the axe. The surface has patinated, suggesting the damage occurred in antiquity. Further evidence of battering can be seen on the side of the face and above the break. The rear has a tears corresponding to the impact points. All damage to the axe, apart from the loop appears to have occurred in antiquity. The surface has a pale-green patina with small surviving traces of a black patina or corrosion surviving.



The damage to the axe appears to have occurred in antiquity and may have been deliberate, possibly for votive purpose.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,62.7,,,,44.1,1,Edward Besly,Wenke Domscheit,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llanhennock,ST3894,From finder,51.64136803,-2.8973618,NMGW-38B29D,,2013.73.1jpg.jpg,Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe of South Wales (Stogursey) Type,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.73.1jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/490537.jpg
646388,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1250,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) early un looped palstave / primary Group I - shield patterned palstave of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1300 BC) - most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX



The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex (fan like) blade. The cutting edge has been lost. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade (measured from the blade edge to the stop ridge) is 80.56 mm long and the width of blade at its widest point is 63.21 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 8.56 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 24.25 mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 32.5 mm). Directly below the stop ridge are two concave depressions which are bordered by slightly raised ridges. This pattern is more visible on one face than the other. The convex cutting edge of the blade is lost through corrosion, abrasion and probably wear. Although evidence of the blade facet remains on both sides of the object The exposed edge is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This may be due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion or be functional use in the active Bronze Age life of the palstave. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 69.94 mm long, 17.6 mm wide and 6.1 mm thick. The butt of the axe is complete. The width at the butt is 28.4 mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ slightly from one another. However, one face of the axe has been severally damaged by abrasion and corrosion which renders comparison between the two faces difficult. Below the stop ridge on one face there is a u-shaped hollow section which is cast into the object. It measures 28.5 mm long and 24.1 mm wide. It is better preserved on one side than the other probably due to movement or corrosion whilst within the plough soil.



The palstave is a mid green colour with areas of thick well formed patina and exposed areas of abraded metal. It is likely that abrasion and corrosion has spread and affected 40% of the surface of the axe. However, this corrosion seems to be relatively stable at present and relatively few areas of light green active powdery corrosion can be observed. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Similar examples to this palstave can be seen in: Savory, 1980; Catalogue of the Bronze Age collections in the National Museum of Wales; entry 153 from St Fagans, Glamorgan. This form and style of palstave fits can be classifided as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC specifically within the  Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX.

646532,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An almost complete decorated Flat Axe / axehead of Early Bronze Age Period, date (2000-1700 BC). The general form of the axe is complete, however it has suffered significant loss from corrosion at both the cutting edge and the butt. In plan the axe is broadly rectangular with narrow rounded butt and expanded / splayed cutting edge. In profile the axe is lentoid. In section the axe is broadly rectangular (rectangular with rounded edges) and there are no signs of raised flanges or hafting augmentation. There is also no sign of a proto stop ridge / median bevel. The surface patina has been poorly preserved and the majority has flaked away because of laminating surface corrosion. One face is better preserved than the other. The remaining surface patina shows evidence of decoration - specifically small lentoid shaped depressions aligned vertically on the axe blade. This form of decoration is known as rain pattern and is common on some axes of the later early bronze age. The long edges of the axe are also poorly preserved, again it is possible there are some facets possibly suggesting cable like decoration. The axe is a light green to light brown colour and has an uneven polished patina; elements of the axe are still coated in soil. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age of metalworking stage IV which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Migdale Variant Biggar (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 18-19. 220 Knapton or 229 Stamfordham).



The axe measures 150.2mm long, the cutting edge has a width of 68.2 mm and the butt is 30.6 mm wide.

646743,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1400,-1100,"A hoard of two incomplete Middle Bronze Age rapiers dating to the period c. 1400 - 1100 BC.



Both blades best described as rapiers and best placed in Burgess & Gerloff's 'Group III' (Burgess, C.B., and Gerloff, S. 1981. The Dirks and Rapiers of Great Britain and Ireland.



Pr√§historische Bronzefunde IV, 7 Beck: Munich).



The rapiers will be discussed as rapier A and rapier B.



Rapier A consists of six fragments of the blade along with six rivets from the handle. One of the breaks between two of the fragments may be deliberate, the other breaks appear to have occured during deposition. All of the fragments feature substantial damage along both edges of the blade. All of the fragments exhibit one surface with a smooth dark green patina with some pitting and one surface with a heavily pitted, rough dark green patina. The uppermost section comprises widened shoulders which measure 63.47mm at their widest point. They have been damaged along the top by a series of old breaks. The edge of one notch is visible along the break line. The blade then tapers to a width of 19.82mm and terminates in a jagged break point. The blade is lozengiform in cross-section and features a thick, prominent mid-rib.



The second fargment of rapier A has straight parallel sides and is lozengiform in cross-section. The blade is slightly curved along its length and terminates in an old break which may have been deliberate. This fragment measures 129.16mm in length, 20.77mm in width, tapering to a width of 18.39mm and is 7.37mm thick.



The third fragment tapers noticably along its length 77.64mm in length, 16.92mm in width, tapering to a width of 14.24mm. It is 6.51mm thick, narrowing to a thickness of 5.91mm. The fourth fragment measures 41.00mm in length, tapers from a width of 13.07mm to 11.95mm and is 5.43mm thick. The fifth fragment measures 15.28mm in length, 11.05mm in width and is 5.15mm thick. The sixth fragment comprises the tip of the blade and narrows markedly incomparison to the other fragments. measures 46.45mm in length, tapers from a width of 11.67mm to a width of 3.98mm and narrows from a thickness of 5.19mm to 3.47mm. It terminates in an old break.



The rivets are cylindrical in shape, each featuring a ridged collar at either terminal with rounded ends. They all feature an uneven dark green and brown patina. One terminates in an old break, however, the other five are all intact, save minor surface damage. The rivets vary in length from 21.44mm to 13.34mm and in diameter from 19.21mm to 11.78mm.



Rapier B comprises three fragments of the blade. It is missing the hilt and shoulders. The first fragment is rectangular in shape and lozengifrom in cross section. The blade has been faceted, with a prominent mid-rib and two additional ribs flanking, creating four facets on each surface. The faceting is also visible in the cross section. The fragment measures 131.72mm in length, 23.34mm in width, tapering to 20.91mm and is 7.29mm thick.



The second fragment tapers slightly along its length. The break point at one end seems to match with the break point of the first section. One surface has a deeply pitted dark greeen patina. The other surface exhibits a smooth dark green patina interspersed with uneven patches of green and brown corrosion product and some recent scratches where the original colour of the metal is visible. It measures 135.66mm in length, 21.17mm in width, tapering to 18.66mm and is 7.11mm thick, narrowing to 6.47mm.



The third fragment comprises the tip of the blade and commences with a deliberate break, visible where the blade has been bent out of shape and snapped. Unlike the first two fragments, this fragment only exhibits one thickened ridge running along its length, rather than the faceted surfaces of the other two fragments. Both surfaces feature a pitted and scratched dark green patina. The fragment measures 156.65mm in length, 23.36mm in width, tapering to 8.98mm and is 11.86mm thick, narrowing to 8.11mm.","These two rapiers were found at the same farm at least 10 years ago, the finder is deceased.

647636,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A possible socketed spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1500 to 1150 BC.



Most of the blade and some of the socket are missing. The breaks are patinated suggesting they are not recent. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded leaf-shaped blade. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge however both are incomplete. Running either side of the loops along the length of the object there is some evidence for casting seams. The spearhead has lozenge-shape cross section across the blade before rounding to create a sub-circular cross section at the socket. The spearhead measures 48.86 mm length, has a maximum width of 11.3mm. The spearhead weighs 13.28 grams. There is some organic material in the socket however it is unclear if this is related to the use of the object. 



The spearhead is a string loop type, which suggests later middle Bronze Age to early late Bronze Age date. Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. Acton Park II industry.

The spear has a lozenge shaped cross- section with a high mid-rib which tapers towards from the tip toward the break. The socket is conical and incomplete with part of the reverse section being broken (presumably in antiquity). The surviving socket depth is 27.1 mm. The socket has a circular external as well as internal section. The inner, hollow, part of the socket shows evidence of mineralised wood. The blade extends at the head of the socket and the overal shape is lost due to abrasion all that remains are shallow crescentic fragments. There is no evidence of side loops, although these may well have been lost through movement in the soil. It is further possible that the socket may have had a circular peg hole - but again this is also lost due to the significant damage. The fragment has a well developed brown patina, there is also a small section of brass coloured bare metal evident at the very tip of the object.



Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



The Spearhead measures 97.7 mm long, 17 mm wide, is 9.1 mm thick and weighs 24.9 grams.

648821,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Copper alloy spearhead. Small cast socketed spearhead with a rounded end to its trapezoidal blade, of length 35.2mm and of thin lentoid section, which has blunt cutting edges of length 32mm. The base of the blade has an abrupt inswing, forming a slightly oblique angle with the cutting edges, though its angles are rounded like the tip. The narrow tapering socket appears to have been solid where it meets the blade, and its hollow extent was measured as only 20mm in length from its mouth, albeit without aggressive investigation. The socket, of total length 30mm, tapers from a maximum external diameter of 9.3mm at its mouth to 5.9mm where it meets the blade. The thickness of the wall of the socket is 2mm, so this could accommodate a shaft of only c.5mm diameter. The mouth of the socket is chipped on one side. The blade is now bent slightly out of alignment with the socket.



The finder identifies this object as an arrowhead, though metal arrowheads of the Bronze Age have always been scarce. Evans (1881, pages 317-318) was aware of two Irish points which might have tipped a dart or javelin, and could cite a further five possible examples from the rest of the United Kingdom. None appear in Davey's 1970 survey of Bronze Age metalwork from Lincolnshire. The points and edges of this object are uniformly rounded, and all seem to have less potential to cut or pierce than the metal at the mouth of the socket. This suggests that the blunted blade is a deliberately formed feature, as both blade and socket would have been equally exposed to post-depositional wear or abrasion. The weight also exceeds that of arrowheads found practical by experimental researchers and re-enactors investigating the properties of arrowheads from the Mediterranean and the Near East. Dot Boughton has kindly solicited further comment on this object from Richard Davis,whose observations appear in the notes below. Inter alia, these confirm that a ritual or symbolic function may be suggested, particularly in the light of its small size and blunt point.



The rarity of this object class commends this as a find of note.



Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC.



Length: 69.2mm, Width: 19.2mm, Diameter (mouth of socket): c.9mm, Thickness (base of blade): 4.8mm, Weight: 19.61gms.","This object has the appearance of a Bronze Age spearhead. It has a number of unusual attributes:- 1. The blade had a very low, wide base. I have identified a group of British pegged spearheads as ""Wide blade base"", but none exactly match this one. There are a number of side looped, ogival bladed spearheads from the MBA with a blade base like this. There are also some Dutch pegged spearheads from the MBA/LBA with a similar wide blade base. 2. Overall length at 69 mm is very short. I have recorded only 12 LBA spearheads with a length shorter than this. 3. Socket mouth opening is extremely narrow at 5 mm. I have not come across any spearheads with such a narrow opening. 4. Depth of socket aperture at roughly half the socket length below the blade is not matched elsewhere. The shortest is up to the blade/socket junction. However, it is possible that the socket is blocked by debris which is a relatively common occurrence. This can be checked by a probe. Some replicas of BA spearheads, made in the modern era, have a drilled socket aperture that is of this length, as compared to the BA technology of casting the socket aperture in the mould. 5. Socket narrows as it approaches the blade base. There is an LBA group of 31 spearheads with this attribute. 6. No pegholes or loops on the socket. This is a rare occurrence, but has been found in a few MBA and LBA British spearheads. 7. The rounded/blunt tip is a relatively common attribute in British MBA and LBA spearheads. From the photograph, the condition of the metal appears consistent with deposition in the BA, but inspection of the actual object may give greater clarification. The key attribute that gives a problem in identification is the narrowness of the socket mouth opening. It would not hold a wooden shaft strong enough for normal use as a spearhead. I suppose it could function as a throwing spear, but there are no such parallels in Britain. I do not know much about bronze arrowheads: they are very rare in Britain, and the ones that I have seen are tanged. One explanation may be that it is a miniature for ritual use. The unsharpened blade and rounded tip support this. I have seen axeheads that are miniature versions of regular axehead types, and they are interpreted as being used in ritual deposition. There is a miniature flat axe from King's Bromley, Staffs, that is 68 mm in length.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2014-10-02T23:00:00Z,,,,19.61,,9,4.8,69.2,1,Martin Foreman,Martin Foreman,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Lincolnshire,North Lincolnshire,Alkborough,SE8921,GPS (from the finder),53.67789615,-0.65410751,NLM-4A4F79,,NLM26823a.jpg,Bronze Age spearhead,North Lincolnshire Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mforeman/NLM26823a.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1137149.jpg

649141,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Early Bronze Age bronze Flat Axe of Type Migdale (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44)[1], or Class 3C Type Harlyn Bay (following Needham 1983; forthcoming) of Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.



The axe is complete, with some surface damage (with a length of 139.7mm and a weight of 397.4g). The asymmetrical butt is very thin and 'edge-like' and is rounded (with a width of 30.6mm). The sides are straight and divergent to just above the midpoint (c. 60mm from the butt), after which the sides are concave and divergent to produce a moderately rounded blade edge (with a width of 80.6mm). The midsection of the blade edge is comparatively straight, possibly through use. The sides are slightly rounded across their thickness. The axe faces are both convex, producing a lentoid body profile, with no evidence of a blade facet. The surface is corroded and heavily-pitted with remnant patches of dark-brown patina. There is no evidence to suggest surface decoration on the remnants of surviving surface.



Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the axe and was carried out[3] using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM) fitted with an Oxford Instruments energy dispersive X-ray detector and INCA spectrometer (EDS). Operating conditions employed a 30o take-off angle, a 20kV accelerating voltage, and the samples were analysed for 100 seconds livetime with a beam current which yielded a count rate of c.4000 counts per second when on a metallic cobalt standard. The results show the metal composition is a tin-bronze alloy (with mean readings of copper: 85.86% and tin: 10.98%), with a significant trace of arsenic (with a mean reading of 2.67%) and traces of lead (with a mean reading of 0.44%). It is difficult to match this composition to Northover's (1980, p 229-243 )[4] Early Bronze Age metal groups.



The generalised form of this bronze axe is thin butted with gradually diverging sides to a comparatively wide blade edge. The axe has no developed features seen on later axes and therefore is likely to be of Type Migdale dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.

649207,Sickle,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-500,"Late Bronze Age socketed sickle of Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking, corresponding to Needham's (1996)[1] Periods 7 - 8, dated to 950 - 500BC.



The sickle is fragmentary, represented by the incomplete socket and beginning of the blade (with a surviving length of 30.2mm and a weight of 18.1g). The socket is oval and is basal edge is undamaged (24.6mm long and 11.7mm wide, with internal dimensions of 23.1mm x 18-19mm). The socket is cast (1.3mm thick) without a visible casting seam and the side without the blade is straight. The top of the socket is damaged and has been slightly distorted (with internal dimensions 12.4mm x 7 - 9mm). The socket is perforated with two pairs of holes to accommodate the missing attachment rivets. The pair of holes near the apex have a slightly larger diameter (at 5.0mm - 6.0mm compared to the lower holes at 4.7mm - 5.5mm) and the pairs are not now directly opposite each other, probably because of distortion in the socket. The beginning of the blade springs from the side of the socket laterally, defining it as of Fox's (1939)[2] Group I socketed sickles. The small fragment of the surviving blade has clear evidence for a midrib. The blade is of lentoid, or pointed-oval section (23.5mm long and 5.6mm thick) and the top of the blade would have been below the top of the socket. There is no definite evidence for a rib on the short blade fragment surviving. The surface has a black patina with areas of brown stripped and corroded surface.



Although fragmentary, there appears to be enough of the sickle to identify it as a socketed type of Fox's Group I and was likely to be of Late Bronze Age to Earliest Iron Age date, c. 1100 BC - 600BC. In Wales, sickles have been found associated with Ewart Park and Llyn Fawr assemblages within South-East Wales and probable tanged examples are represented in the Llantwit Major (Vale of Glamorgan) and Glascoed (Monmouthshire) hoards, both of Ewart Park metalworking and socketed examples in the Cardiff and Llyn Fawr (Rhondda Cynon Taff) hoards both of Llyn Fawr metalworking. This example appears to be a westerly outlier of the South-Welsh examples. Fox (ibid) demonstrated that sickles have a largely Irish distribution with a spread in Scotland and within England sickles are concentrated in the Thames Valley and in East Anglia. The few examples recorded by PAS to date, also have a largely eastern British distribution, with western examples of tanged form from Gloucestershire[3] and Somerset[4] and a sickle blade[5] from Rossett, Wrexham. Since the blade of this example ends before the top of the socket, the sickle may have been of open or closed, flat-topped form, which Fox (ibid.) suggests have an earlier date in the Group I sequence. Savory (1980, p 56)[6] stated that earlier stages of socketed sickles were not represented in Wales but it is possible to suggest that this example may represent the first. Few recorded socketed sickles have two rivet holes or have the rivet holes positioned adjacent to the blade.

The socketed gouge is incomplete, missing the mouth (with a surviving length of 41.4mm and a weight of 18.6g). The socket is oval at the break (with maximum surviving external dimensions of 15.0mm x 10.7mm and 11.3mm x 8.5mm internal) with no mouth mouldings present on the incomplete socket. Beneath the break is the beginning of groove, of V-shaped profile near the top and becoming U-shaped towards the blade. The sides of the gouge are straight and parallel (producing a blade width also of 15.0). The casting seams are no longer evident on either side. The blade comprises a shallow U-shaped depression and is evident below the break (39.2mm from the blade edge). The blade edge has moderate damage and is not significantly expanded. Linear striations are evident running along the groove. The surface has a dark brown patina with patches of a dark-green patina.



The missing mouth makes typological identification difficult, Savory (1980, p 55)[2] suggests that the earliest socketed gouges such as those that occur in the Guilsfield hoard have multiple mouth mouldings, whereas later gouges tend to have a broad flat collar.

A Late Bronze Age/Earliest Iron Age complete cast copper alloy socketed axehead of South-Eastern (LBA) or Sompting (EIA) type, of the Ewart Park/Llyn Fawr metalworking tradition. The axehead is wedge-shaped with a square socket at the haft end. Internally the socket tapers and narrows from the mouth to the cutting edge. Externally the axehead expands gently along the body before a very slightly wider flare to the curved but now damaged cutting edge. There is a wide circumferential raised mouth moulding at the socket, with a second much narrower moulding below. To one side of the mouth, just below the wide moulding and interrupting the narrower ridge, a side loop is present with D-shaped cross-section. Casting flashes remain on both sides of the axehead, including on the loop. Both faces of the axehead are decorated with three long narrow ribs, similar in dimensions to the narrower mouth moulding. Much of the surface of the axehead is missing, including the ends of all six ribs.

The sword is fragmentary, represented by a blade fragment, broken at both ends in antiquity (with a surviving length of 42.2mm and a weight of 22.7g). The blade has no clearly defined midrib but has near straight faces gradually diverging towards the rounded central ridge (giving a consistent thickness of 5.7mm) of lenticular section. Both blade edges have been lost and only a very small piece of edge faceting is now evident (with a maximum surviving blade width of 26.7mm). The short blade fragment is flat across its length with no evidence of bending prior to breaking. There appear to be numerous striations running along the blade probably resulting from sharpening. The surface has a dark green patina preserved over much of the fragment with a silver sheen, probably from surface enrichment of tin and with areas of bright green corrosion at the periphery.



The fragmentary nature of the blade, lacking diagnostic features makes typological identification difficult. The comparatively slender form of the blade may suggest its derived from near the tip. Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered.

The hammer is fragmentary, broken across its width and is represented by just under half of the original (with a surviving width of 23mm and a weight of 40.9g). The whole length of the hammer is represented on the side (with a length of 52.2mm). The mouth suggests a square or rectangular body section (with external surviving dimensions of 22.3mm x 16.3mm and with an internal width of 16.7mm) and had a simple moulding (5-6mm long), now worn. There is no surviving evidence for casting runner stubs on the mouth (with a maximum surviving thickness of 4.7mm). The side and faces have a concave slope from the mouth, becoming parallel near the end (with a width of 13.3mm). It is possible to tentatively suggest the presence of a casting seam on the side. No decoration is evident on the fragment. The interior of the socket is roughly-cast and the base of the socket is not obvious (probably a base thickness of 6-7mm and socket depth of 46mm). The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted with a bronze-brown colour.



Socketed hammers are comparatively unusual discoveries, the quadrangular form of this example is more typical of examples sometimes associated with Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park metalwork, although early hammers have been found associated with metalwork dating to the end of the Middle Bronze Age. Two other hammers are recorded from Wales at present, both from North Wales; one from the Bronze Age occupation soil behind the rampart of the hillfort at the Breiddin (D.G. Coombs 1991 in Musson ed., mo. 139, 3 133-4)[1], the Breiddin hammer is sub-quadrangular in form and is expanded at the working platform. The other known example is an unpublished, example from Burton, Wrexham (Gwilt pers comm.) and is more rounded in form. Hammers often have a higher tin content in the bronze (Coombs ibid.; Evans; 1881[2]) compared to contemporary axes, it has not been possible to metallurgically analyse this example at present.

651363,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-700,"Late Bronze Age socketed tool, probably a hammer of c. 1200 - 700BC



The tool is near-complete with some peripheral damage and is very-heavily corroded and pitted (with a length of 61.6mm and a weight of 99.4g). The mouth is rectangular (29.2mm long and 19.4mm wide) and of variable thickness, with one side edge (6.7mm thick) being considerably thicker than the other side (5.0mm thick) or either face (4mm thick). The socket is also rectangular (8.1mm x 10.9mm and 40.5mm deep). There was a mouth moulding (7mm long), which appears to have been a simple collar but is poorly preserved. The sides are near-straight or gently concave, expanding slightly to the hammer platform (with a minimum width of 25mm and a blade platform width of 27.1mm). The sides appear to have been near-straight perhaps slightly convex across their width, producing a consistent sub-rectangular body section. The face were decorated with two ribs, converging to a single central rib in a Y-shaped device (29mm long). The hammer platform is rounded and is convex across both its length and thickness (with a thickness of 11mm). The surface is poorly preserved with remnant traces of mid-green patina surviving in protected areas in the socket and between the ribs. There are some areas of bright-green corrosion on the surface.



Bronze Age socketed hammers are not frequently reported, with 26 reported examples to PAS at the time of writing. The quadrangular form of this example is more typical of examples sometimes associated with Late Bronze Age, Ewart Park metalwork, although early hammers have been found associated with metalwork dating to the end of the Middle Bronze Age. The decorative Y motif is also unusual and difficult to parallel but may be seen as a variation of the trident motif, sometimes seen on palstave axes or converging ribs, seen on socketed axes. Hammers often have a higher tin content in the bronze (Coombs ibid.; Evans; 1881[1]) compared to contemporary axes, it has not been possible to metallurgically analyse this example at present but the weight would may suggest a high proportion of lead, rather than tin.

Copper alloy socketed spearhead that dates to the middle Bronze Age. The blade of the spearhead is leaf/lozenge-shaped with blades that gently angle inwards from an expanded midsection. Running down the centre of the blades is a triangular cross-section spine on both sides. Towards the edge of one blade, in the middle where it is at its widest point, is a drilled hole, this hole has been drilled from both directions, resulting in it having an hour-glass shape profile. The socket has a circular cross-section and expands from the base of the blades Some of the lower portion or the socket ostruncated, although remains of the rivet holes are still visible towards the base.

The axe is fragmentary, broken across both its width and length (with a maximum surviving length of 45.0mm, a maximum surviving thickness of 13.5mm and a weight of 53.1g). The one surviving side on the axe is concave, flaring to the blade tip. The casting seam is prominent and raised but has been neatly finished by hammering (with a thickness at the side of 5.4mm). The sides are angled towards the casting seam and would have produced a sub-hexagonal body section. The axe fragment is widest at the blade (with a surviving maximum blade width of 33.6mm). The blade edge has a moderate curve and appears damaged and blunted, presumably by repeated impacts. The basal parts of three converging ribs are discernible on the more complete face, where the face appears to have been pounded repeatedly (with a thickness of 5.4mm). The base of the socket is evident on the interior (with a maximum surviving depth of 24.2mm). Sharpening striations are evident running along the blade on both faces. The surface has a dark-green patina with patches of pale-green corrosion.



The fragmentary state of the axe makes a confident identification difficult but the surviving features of the axe are consistent with the South Wales type. The damage patterns on the axe may suggest deliberate damage to the axe prior to deposition.

652748,Razor,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1500,"A copper alloy blade fragment, probably a double-edged razor dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age, about 2,150 BC - 1,500 BC. The fragment is roughly leaf-shaped with a pointed oval (or flat diamond-shaped) cross-section. The outside edges are very wavy and ragged and there does not appear to be a socket, instead being tanged, though this has broken off. The sides appear to curve inwards towards the tang. There is no decoration on the surface. A smooth mid green patina survives in places but mud adhereing to the faces obscures much of the surface. The break is not as patiated as the rest of the object. The probable razor is 53.52mm long, 19.26mm wide and 4.4mm thick. It is 2.4mm thick at tip. 12.77g. Compare SF5067 and SWYOR-A48EE1 which is from the neighbouring parish.



Peter Reavill comments that Double edged razors have a distribution which was ""Widespread across Britain and Ireland, particularly in the Midlands, Yorkshire, Wessex and the Thames area."" He goes on to cite The PAS Bronze Age Guide by Ben Roberts, that: ""The term double-edged razor covers three broad types of the same implement; those that were handled, [those] with a pierced tang, and [those] with a non-pierced tang. Representing the earliest form of copper-alloy razor, these varied in shape, starting initially with the handled examples which resembled spearheads (i.e. elongated triangular-edges, with one or two rivet holes at the base for affixing a handle. The tanged varieties were more leaf shaped, echoing the styles that came afterwards. The overall shape and size of these razors varied slightly across different regions of continental Europe, resulting in many different typologies and sub-categories.""",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2014-05-31T23:00:00Z,2014-09-10T23:00:00Z,,,12.77,,,4.4,53.52,1,Peter Reavill,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,Doncaster,Doncaster,Wadworth,SK5696,From finder,53.45778377,-1.15808943,SWYOR-CA128E,,PAS_2364_spear.jpg,Bronze Age blade,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2364_spear.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/495127.jpg
652992,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1200,"Bronze Age socketed spearhead, possibly of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1600 - 1200BC



The spearhead is fragmentary, represented by a median fragment (with a surviving length of 47.7mm and a weight of 9.4g). The mouth of the socket is missing (with a surviving depth of 31.4mm) and is open on one face but appears to have been of sub-circular to oval (with a maximum surviving internal diameter of 8mm). The socket defines a prominent midrib on the more complete face (giving a maximum surviving thickness of 7.5mm). On either side of the midrib, the beginnings of the blade are evident but are heavily truncated (with a maximum surviving width of 13.3mm). There is the suggestion that the blade edges begin just above the break and if correct, implies a spearhead of comparatively small size. The tip is missing and the spearhead is of pointed oval section at the break (8.8mm wide and 4.3mm thick). The surface is heavily-corroded but remnant traces of a dark brown patina survive on the side of the midrib and displays filing or sharpening striations running along the blade.



The fragmentary aspect and poor preservation of the artefact makes any identification difficult, the general form however is consistent with Middle Bronze Age spearheads and the suggested scale may tentatively suggest a spearhead of side-looped type and of Acton Park metalworking, dating to c. 1600 - 1400BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,9.4,,,,47.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llancarfan,ST0770,From finder,51.42135531,-3.33888791,NMGW-DD80BC,,2013.195.1jpg.jpg,"Bronze Age socketed spearhead, possibly of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1600 ‚Äì 1200BC",All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.195.1jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/495233.jpg

The blade is fragmentary (with a surviving length of 24.7mm and a weight of 5.1 g) and appears to represent a fragment from the apex of the blade and beginning of the hilt. The suggested hilt part is wider and marginally thinner (with a maximum surviving width of 22.8mm and a thickness of 2.0mm). The blade edge does not survive on either side (with a minimum surviving width of 15.5mm, where it has a thickness of 2.8mm). A sub-circular notch may possibly be the remains of a rivet attachment hole.  However, only one face only has a midrib (12mm wide), the other face is flat and featureless. The surface is poorly preserved with remnants of a dark-brown patina, consistent with Bronze Age metalwork from the area; elsewhere the surface has a grey-green corrosion.





The fragmented and corroded state make any identification tentative; the form is consistent with Bronze Age blades, possibly reworked although one flat side is difficult to understand but may relate to its reworking.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,5.1,,,2,24.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llancarfan,ST0770,From finder,51.42135531,-3.33888791,NMGW-DE801C,,2013.195.2jpg.jpg,Possible blade fragment of Bronze Age date,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2013.195.2jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/495289.jpg

653445,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1100,"Middle Bronze Age bronze spearhead of side-looped type, falling within Davis' (2012) Group 6 (Developed side-looped). 



The spearhead is near-complete, with some peripheral damage, missing some of the mouth and one of the side loops (with a length of 110.7mm) and the socket retains the deposit (giving a weight of 53.5g). The mouth is sub-circular (with a diameter of 18.5mm - 19.8mm) and the rim has a subtle bevel. The loops were flat-topped and oval (18-19mm long, 6mm wide and 2mm high), positioned approximately halfway between the mouth and start of the blade (14-16mm from the mouth and 12-13mm from the start of the blade). One of the loops is damaged and has lost its apex. Above the loops, the socket becomes more oval (12.7mm x 14.5mm) and is marked with prominent incised grooves, with four on one side and five on the other, possibly to imitate or accommodate the binding. The blade is flame-shaped (with a length of 60.5mm and a maximum width of 22.5mm) and has some recent edge damage. The socket continues along the blade to the tip as a prominent but gradually weakening midrib. The blade rib is slightly faceted, possibly because of filing or sharpening the blade. Sharpening striations are clearly discernible on both faces, running along the blade. Blade facets (3mm wide) are evident where the blade edge survives. The break at the tip may have occurred in antiquity through use. The surface has a deep-brown patina with pale green corrosion around the areas of damage.



The lateral grooves between the loops and blade are not common features and are difficult to closely parallel.

The spearhead is represented the incomplete pointed socket only (with a surviving length of 67.8mm and a weight of 36.6g). The socket (with a surviving depth of 34.5mm and a maximum surviving internal diameter of 14mm and 20mm external) is open on one face and appears to have been sub-circular to oval. The interior of the socket is particularly roughly cast at its base but has undergone more finishing near the break. There are remnant stubs on one side, possibly suggesting loops for binding a spearhead. The spearhead width expands slightly where the blade would have begun (to 21.5mm) before the straight sides converge to the point. Both face are convex and rounded and the more complete face has a slight concavity along its length. The converging sides appear damaged with the stubs of the blade evident. There is a concave stepped moulding at the top of the socket on both faces where remnants of the patina survive. The remnant surface has a green-brown patina and elsewhere has a pale-green corrosion.



The fragmentary aspect and poor preservation of the artefact makes any identification difficult, the form however is consistent with Bronze Age spearheads and the remnant stubs on the side of the socket may suggest a spearhead of side-looped type and of Acton Park metalworking, dating to c. 1600 - 1400BC.

654503,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead, of possible Late Bronze Age dating (1000 BC to 800 BC).



Probably less than 40% of the socketed axehead is present, consisting of part of the main body, the base of the socket and the blade edge. The fragment is sub rectangular in plan, and triangular in section. The socket is sub-rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along one of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at one side, forming a sharp curve (or hook), the other side shows signs of damage. The blade shows signs of breakage and damage. The cutting edge is still visible on the front of the axehead. There are possible file marks, evidence of sharpening, present on the front of the axehead.



The socketed axehead fragment measures 39.8 mm in length, 40.9 mm wide (at the blade), 34.5 mm wide (at the body), 16.3 mm thick (at the body), 5.02 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 26.6 mm deep. It weighs 61.4 g.



The socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with areas of brown colouring, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.

654527,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1950,"A cast copper alloy flat axe of Early Bronze Age date, about 2200 BC - 1950 BC. The axe is probably a broad butt flat axe of Migdale type (decorated Variant) and is decorated with rain pattern.



The blade flares from about two thirds of the way from the butt, with angular shoulders; this may have been secondary hammering; the cutting edge was narrower to begin with. The blade is 70.3mm wide at the tips, and flares from 46.2mm wide at the change of angle. The butt is 33.2mm wide half way along, and has a rounded end. The cutting edge is damaged, and is mainly missing. It is 6.2mm thick at the blade end, where the cutting edge should be. The axe is 11.9mm thick in the centre, and tapers to 6.8mm thick at the butt. The sides of the blade are not symmetrical, the change of angle being more pronounced on one side. If it was symmetrical originally, the axe must have lost a lot of metal and it seem more likely that the sides were never exactly matching. There are no flanges, but the sides do become more square in the centre of the axe. Most of the original surface of the metal is missing at the butt end.



One face is better preserved than the other, and it is decorated with faint longitudinal grooves covering the blade half of the axe (rain pattern). Each groove is only about 1mm wide and they seem to be long, continuous lines rather than short dashes. The other face of the axe has less of the original surface surviving, but traces of a similar pattern are just visible. The axe has been treated with an oil, PEG or wax coating, and it appears that it was placed on this face while the coating was still wet, so an impression of the cloth or polyroll it rested on is obvious; a pattern of small circles or dimples.



The axe has a dark green to black colour and is in a stable condition, though it has suffered from corrosion. Overall, it is 140.5mm long, 70.3mm wide and 12mm thick. It has a mass of 336g.

Qualitative portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analysis of a metal axe: 



 by Seosaimh√≠n Bradley



University of Central Lancashire



Method



The axe was placed in a bench top test stand and the pXRF spectrometer was secured underneath. This was undertaken in order to ensure that the axe did not move during analysis, and that the distance between the surface of the axe and the x-ray beam remained constant. The surface of the axe was corroded and quite uneven in places, so areas chosen for analysis were selected because they were flatter and more even.



Two readings were taken, in two different areas. Each reading lasted 60 seconds and the pXRF instrument was set at 40kV, 15¬µA, and with no filter applied. The results were gathered by the accompanying software, S1PXRF, which generated a spectra of results. Further analysis was completed using ARTAX software, which identifies the elements that have been detected, and provides the number of counts per second gathered for each identified element. These counts per second were converted into relative percentages to facilitate analysis. This report uses these relative percentages, and is therefore not of absolute elemental concentrations.



pXRF does not detect all the elements that are present, as some elements are beneath the detection limits of the instrument. Only three elements could be reliably determined: iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and tin (Sn). Small amounts of rhodium (Ru) were detected but this is likely to be interference from the spectrometer, as the x-ray tube contains rhodium. The counts per second recorded for each of these elements was converted into a relative percentage. These results have not been calibrated to an external standard and are therefore not quantitative, but can give an indication of the relative percentage of each of the identified elements. The table below shows the results.

The results of the pXRF analysis indicate that the axe is made of bronze. Further work is required in order to determine in what concentrations these elements appear.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2005-01-01T00:00:00Z,2006-12-31T00:00:00Z,,,336,,,12,140.5,1,Frank Jolley,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,Calderdale,Calderdale,Luddendenfoot,SE0428,GPS (from the finder),53.74835744,-1.94082364,SWYOR-6D80EC,,FD_Axe_1.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/FD_Axe_1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/496223.jpg
654630,Awl,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1250,-800,"Copper alloy chisel or awl, possibly of Late Bronze Age date

The tool is complete (with a length of 88.1mm and a weight of 9.5g). The tang has a short edge at its apex (1.3mm wide and 0.4mm thick) and is square-sectioned for nearly one-third of its length (for 27mm), gradually widening (to a maximum square-section of 3.7mm). The mid-part of the tool is circular-sectioned (with a diameter of 4.3mm) for a little over one-third of its length (for 31mm). The blade is sub-square sectioned (for 32mm) and each of the four faces on the top of the blade has a clear forged facet, which is possibly decorative. The lower part of the blade is sub-rounded and worn to the angled short chisel-like edge (2.5mm wide). The surface has a rich dark-green patina with the suggestion of more abrasion from one point, possibly suggesting the position of the end of the handle (approximately 37mm from the tip).



Tanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The deep patina and attention to detail with the decorative facets, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date. Bronze Age awls and narrow chisels are not common finds and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC. In Wales a socketed awl (Savory 1980, p 127, no. 307) was recovered from The Great Orme, Conwy associated with a palstave of Late Type and of Ewart Park metalworking.

654721,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age bronze tanged and collared chisel, probably of Ewart Park metalworking industry, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to 950 - 750BC.



The chisel is incomplete, missing the tang and with a little peripheral damage (with a surviving length of 34.1mm and a weight of 7.4g). The tang was truncated in antiquity and survives as a square-sectioned stub (with a surviving length of 4.0mm and a width and thickness of 5.2mm and 4.3mm respectively). The chisel is thickest at the shoulder (at 4.9mm). The shoulder mouldings are triangular, with the top edge perpendicular to the tang (with a length of 4mm and a depth of 3.8mm). The sides of the blade are slightly concave and divergent to the eroded blade edge, producing a near-triangular blade from. The blade tips and original blade edge have been lost (with a surviving blade width of 22.8mm). The blade is flat and thins gradually towards the edge (with a thickness of 3.2mm below the shoulder and 2.1mm above the edge). There is the suggestion of hammering forming rippled arcs on both blade faces and striations running parallel to the sides. The surface has a brown to dark-green patina with areas of pale-green surface loss and some pitting.



The chisel can be broadly paralleled with an example found in the Brogyntyn Hoard (Savory, 1980, p 123, no 288) in Shropshire, associated with a Hallstatt C sword and a socketed gouge. The Brogyntyn chisel has smaller lugs than this example. In Wales, a similar tanged chisel was found associated with a Ewart Park Hoard from near Ystradgynlais, Powys (Savory, 1980, p 122, no 284).

The palstave is near-complete (with a length of 161mm and a weight of 575.5g). The butt (29.2mm wide and 3.2mm thick) is damaged, possibly from the casting but appears to have ben straight. The sides are straight and broadly parallel as far as the stop (31.6mm wide at the stop). Below the stop (10mm), the sides are prominently nicked (32.8mm wide), below which the sides are concave and divergent to a slightly recurved blade edge (71.5mm wide). The flanges begin at the butt and are straight and divergent, reaching an apex above the stop (with a maximum depth of 39.4mm, 16mm above the stop. The flanges return to the blade below the stop, at the position of the side nicks. The flanges are convex across their depths and appear to have been comparatively elaborate, with an outer border parallel to the flanges (8mm wide) and defining a central lozenge (70mm x 15mm). The septum is comparatively flat and straight (9mm thick, 20mm wide and 33mm long). The stops have a slight curve and are raised above the blade faces (with a height above the septum of 5mm and 9mm and above the blade of 5mm and 3mm). Below the stop is a weak shield device (34mm long) defined by a slightly raised platform, rather than mouldings. Below the shield the blade is flat across its length and very gently convex across its width. There are clear hammered blade facets (beginning 20mm from the blade edge with a lower facet 11mm from the edge). The blade edge has some damage and it is now difficult to identify any contemporary nicks or wear. A small number of sharpening striations are now discernible running along the blade edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina and has suffered from some flaking but has been treated by the finder, possibly altering the patina colour.



The axe is an early example of the palstave form and it has been argued (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pp. 125) that North-East Wales and the Marches was the source of this form of axe type.

The spearhead is incomplete and heavily corroded, missing the mouth, tip, blade and side loops (with a surviving length of 62.6mm and a weight of 15.0g with an emptied socket). The mouth has been lost and the base is sub-circular (with a diameter of 12.4mm - 14.2mm and with a thickness of up to 2mm). The socket has straight sides which gradually converge (with a surviving depth of 33.5mm). Remnants of the stubs of the side loops are discernible on both sides (beginning 23mm from the surviving mouth and with a length of 9mm). Further along the spearhead the remnants of the blade are discernible (beginning 38mm from the surviving mouth). The spearhead appears to have been of sub-lozenge section at the blade, probably suggesting a midrib. Little survives of the blade, which survives as a flange (with a maximum surviving height of 1.0mm). The spearhead has broken before the tip but above the end of the socket, although there is the suggestion of tapering brown core beneath the bronze, perhaps representing the core from casting. Surprisingly, the core was observed to be magnetic, indicating that it is ferrous, possibly suggesting reuse or repair at a later date (at least 800 years later) or possibly but unlikely as a by-product of the casting process or because of a post-depositional event. Patches of the original surface with a dark green patina survives and there is the suggestion of sharpening striations running parallel to the blade.

661675,Assemblage,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-2400,-2200,"Description: Beaker/Early Bronze Age gold beads



Found during controlled archaeological excavations by Wessex Archaeology, on 12th October 2011 while excavating the remains of a prehistoric 'Beaker' burial.



Five sheet gold beads and other artefacts (Beaker vessel, amber and lignite beads, and seven worked flints) were recorded along with the poorly preserved remains of a >35 year old adult.



Dimensions: Gold beads (incorporating provisional comments by Dr Stuart Needham) ON1527, ON1532-4 and ON1551.



Five gold beads (between 5 mm and 9 mm in length). Sheet pieces of gold that have been rolled to form tubular beads. At least four of the beads have small single/paired perforations (0.5 mm in diameter). All five beads contain a core of what is considered to be soil. This material has been left in place pending further scientific analysis and, therefore, at this stage no accurate weights for the gold can be given. Each bead has been cleaned to aid identification.



Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of the beads indicated a very high precious metal content of gold (Dr Stuart Black, Director of Laboratories (SAGES) Reading University)



Other finds



Ceramic Beaker (ON1526) The vessel appears to be complete, although it was found in a crushed state. Decorated with zonal patterns of impressed comb, it is of low carinated form and equates to Clarke's Northern British/Middle Rhine style (N/MR).



Amber beads (including comment from Dr Alison Sheridan) ON1525, ON1529-31, and ON1557-8.



Four large amber beads ranging in size from 15 mm to 25 mm were recovered from near the head of the burial. A fifth large bead and fragments of other smaller beads were recovered during analysis of the soil blocks. The larger beads are all circular in shape with flattened sides and lateral perforations. They are of an unusual type and the provisional suggestion is that they could derive from eastern England (Dr Alison Sheridan pers comm).



Shale/jet beads ON1552-6



A total of 56 shale/jet beads (24 complete), were recovered from the careful examination and processing of the soil samples and blocks. Unfortunately many of these beads were in a very fragile condition and have not survived. They were recorded and photographed.



Worked Flint (comment from Philippa Bradley)



Seven pieces of worked flint came from the grave fill. The flint comprises three flakes, a fragmentary flake, two blade-like flakes, and a retouched blade-like flake. Dating this small group is hampered by the lack of diagnostic pieces. However, a broad Neolithic to Early Bronze Age date is likely. Given the nature of the material and the lack of retouched forms, it is possible that these are redeposited finds and not intentional grave goods.","The Beaker burial is without close parallel, although the character of the burial indicates that it belongs to a small group of similarly rich burials that have been discovered across Britain. These early burials belong to the Copper Age (Chalcolithic) horizon that marks the end of the Neolithic and the start of the Bronze Age (c.2400-2200 BC). Each of the five ornaments comprises a strip of thin sheet gold rolled to form a tubular 'bead'. Only small numbers of Beaker graves, both in Britain and continental Europe, contain gold ornaments and tubular beads of this sort are rare. Further examples are known in copper or bronze, but again they are far from common finds. The indications are that Kingsmead Quarry is an Early Beaker context making the ornaments some of the earliest goldwork from Britain.



These items are more than 4000 years old and the gold beads are composed of more than 10% precious metal, and therefore should be considered Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996. As the other objects were found within a secure burial context alongside the gold beads they should also be considered as Treasure by association.",4,Gold,Ceramic,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Controlled archaeological investigation,2011-10-11T23:00:00Z,,2011T763,,,,,,,33,Alistair Barclay,Alistair Barclay,South East,Windsor and Maidenhead,Windsor and Maidenhead,Horton,TQ0175,,51.46496902,-0.54744891,PAS-FCAE32,,,,,,,

Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC.

The sides are straight as far as the midpoint, below which they are concave and expand to the eroded blade tips (with a surviving blade width of 56.0mm). The original blade edge has been lost and is moderately curved. The sides are comparatively flat across their thickness with no surviving evidence for any flanges on either face. One face has a clear median bevel (with a thickness of 9.8mm, positioned 58mm from the blade edge, where the axe has a width of 29mm). There is the suggestion of a blade facet discernible (8mm from the edge). The other face has suffered more surface corrosion and does not convincingly display a median bevel or blade facet. The better preserved face has remnant traces of a pale-grey to dark-brown patina, elsewhere the surface is heavily-pitted pale-green to dark-green corrosion.



The axehead has a discernible median bevel on one face, suggesting some developed features on the axe. It is possible that hammered flanges were present but do not now survive.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,173.1,,,,112.8,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,North West,Cheshire West and Chester,Cheshire West and Chester,Agden,SJ5144,From finder,52.99107821,-2.73142244,NMGW-FDAA11,,2014.8.1jpg.jpg,Early Bronze Age: Developed Flat Axe of Aylesford type ,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2014.8.1jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/502059.jpg
661717,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-950,"Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze palstave of Transitional Type and uncertain sub-type, possibly Type Shelf or Roundhay dated to the Penard-Wilburton Metalworking phases (c.1275-950 BC) (following Needham et al. 1997).





The palstave is incomplete missing peripheral areas and has a distorted butt (with a distorted length of 138.3mm and a weight of 323.2g). The butt is narrow and now rounded (with a width of 11mm and a thickness of 3.1mm). There is an oval aperture (5.7mm long and 3.2mm wide) probably the result of a casting flaw, since the flaw continues as a scar along the septum on one face. The butt has been distorted and is bent towards one face. The sides are straight and gradually divergent as far as the stops, where there is a gentle nick. The loop is incomplete, missing its central part (with a length of 29.2mm, internal length of 13.3mm, width of 10.1mm and a surviving height of 8.2mm giving the palstave a maximum surviving width of 35.1mm) and spans the position of the stops. The casting seams are discernible where the surface survives and appear to have been fettled. The sides of the blade are near-straight and divergent to the blade edge. The blade edge has been truncated and the blade tips lost (with a surviving width of 33.6mm). The blade now has a deep curve, although the original blade form is unclear. The septum is straight and flat, gradually thickening to the stops (with a thickness at the stops of 15.4mm). The flanges now rise from well before the butt but again, are likely to be truncated and eroded. The stops are curved with a perpendicular rise from the septum (of 6.7mm). The blade faces are prominently convex across their widths (with a maximum thickness of 20.8mm). There is a sharp bevel from the tops of the stops to the blade faces. The blade faces have no surviving evidence for a midrib or any other motif, accepting that the surface has been lost along the mid-section. The blade faces gradually narrow to the edge with no surviving evidence for a blade facet. The surface has a dark-brown patina, where it survives and elsewhere is pale to dark-green with patches of active corrosion.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2013-09-21T23:00:00Z,,,,323.2,,,,138.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Gnosall,SJ8118,From finder,52.7592681,-2.28298362,NMGW-FDCDF0,,2014.8.2jpg.jpg,Middle to Late Bronze Age palstave of Transitional Type,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2014.8.2jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/502062.jpg

Length: 27.3mm; Width: 30.5mm; Thickness: 5.8mm; Weight: 20.63g;



Discussion: 



The two sword blade fragments are probably from Late Bronze Age Ewart Park type swords and are a very common feature of so-called 'scrap' or 'founders' hoards of Late Bronze Age, especially in Southern England (e.g. Needham 1990). Fragments of ingot are also a regular feature of hoards of Late Bronze Age date, however, 'complete' plano-convex ingots of the type represented by No. 4 are rare but they are known from the assemblage of copper alloy and tin ingots associated with a probable Late Bronze Age shipwreck at Salcombe, Devon (e.g. British Museum 2010, 8032.1 and 2010, 8032.191) and from the Late Bronze Age carp's tongue complex hoard consisting of 352 objects from Boughton Malherbe, Kent (Treasure case 2011 T464).



Conclusion: 



Due to their age and number, this find qualifies as a prehistoric base-metal assemblage and Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996, (Designation) Order 2002.

662554,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed axe of Type Yorkshire and of Ewart Park metalworking, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7, dated to c. 950 - 750BC.





The axe is near-complete with some peripheral loss and has a prominent split down one side (with a length of 75.3mm and a weight of 163.2g).The mouth is sub-rectangular (39.3mm wide x 35.9mm long). The socket (57.8mm deep) has straight sides, each with an internal central rib (beginning 12mm below the mouth) which continue to the base of the socket. The top of the mouth is heavily-corroded, which has removed any evidence for casting runners. The mouth has a prominent rounded moulding and there is a collar moulding beneath the mouth (11mm below). The loop is present (23mm long, 8.5mm wide and 8.4mm high), springing from the collar moulding. The sides are moderately flat across their widths and concave across their lengths, and expand to the blade edge. The blade tips and original blade edge have been lost but the blade appears to have been moderately expanded and with a slight curve (with a surviving blade width of 42.0mm). The casting seams are prominent on both sides and have been hammer-finished. The looped side has a prominent split (43mm long and up to 3mm wide), which may be the result of casting problems. The faces are convex across both their lengths and widths and are decorated with three parallel ribs, descending from the collar moulding. The side ribs are positioned close to the corners of the faces. There are no blade facets evident and no sharpening striations discernible at the blade. The surface has a dark-brown patina, with areas of pale-green corrosion.



Type Yorkshire axes are found throughout Britain but Schmidt & Burgess (1981, pp 238-9, pl. 130) have demonstrated that the distribution is concentrated on the East side of Northern Britain with the greatest density between the rivers Humber and the Tees. This example may be seen as being a somewhat south westerly outlier to the main areas of recovery.

662752,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A small, highly abraded Bronze Age palstave, probably dating to the Middle Bronze Age c. 1500-1150 BC. The butt is damaged with an old break but survives to its original width, 21.3mm. The palstave has a sub-rectangular septum, with a vertical stop ridge on both faces (one notably more worn than the other). The septum is 6.2mm thick and 16.7mm wide, it survives to a length of 24.8mm and is flanged, with these sub-triangular in profile, although again notably more worn on one face than the other.



At the stop ridge the palstave is sub-rectangular in cross section, 20.8mm wide and 19.3mm thick, and was likely originally more regular in shape. Below the stop ridges the axe then costricts to 18.0mm wide, before widening gradually towards the cutting edge, one corner of which has been lost to an old break. The maximum width, just prior to this break is 22.0mm and although it will originally have continued to broaden, the cutting edge now survives to a width of 17.4mm. In profile the blade of the axe tapers gradually from the stop ridge to a point, now fairly rounded by abrasion. There is no indication of any side loop, but it is unclear whether or not there was any moulding beneath the stop ridge.



The palstave is 92.6mm long and weighs 133.89g.



Although difficult to be certain with such an abraded object, the lack of side loops would suggest that it belongs to the Acton Park or Taunton metal working groups, giving the object a likely Middle Bronze Age date.","

662835,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy flat axehead, sub-rectangular in plan and section and triangular in profile, with a rounded end and broken edge where it is missing its blade and more than half of the axe so that just the butt end remains. The fragment tapers towards the butt end which is rounded off and widens towards the broken edge which has been chiselled off, perhaps in order to re-use the fragment for something else. The axehead would have continued to expand into a triangular flat blade which is now missing. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now quite pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are some scratches caused by damage since deposition. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away.



The length is 50 mm, the width of broken edge is 31 mm and the width of the butt end is 27 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 9 mm and the thickness of the butt end is 4 mm.



Similar slender flat axes with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.



Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of slender Migdale type flat axes from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall and Salcombe in Devon, on pages 400 & 453, plates 1 & 38, nos.6 & 289, and a similar fragment of a flat axe that has been chiselled at one end from Penzance, Cornwall on page 423, pl. 15, no.123, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Braddock Downs in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.36, 111 & 213.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

701649,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"A fragment of a large cast copper alloy (bronze) socketed axe. The fragment consists of the cutting edge and lower blade of a late Bronze Age axe (1100 - 800 BC). The axe fragment is sub-rectangular in plan with a curved (convex) cutting edge. The sides, adjacent to the cutting edge, taper inwards towards the break. In profile the fragment is sub-triangular (wedge shaped). The convex cutting edge of the axe fragment, although corroded and abraded, is worn suggesting it was heavily used in antiquity. The break at the top of the fragment is old and abraded and has an uneven edge. The break has occurred almost at the base of the socket. The base of the socket is elliptical in plan and broadly 'u' shaped in cross section. The axe fragment is a light- green to brown colour with a polished but much abraded patina. The loss of patina is mostly around the external edges of the axe at both the cutting edge and broken edge caused by abrasion in the ploughsoil. It is most prominent along the cutting edge and one side has more prominent patina loss than the other. There are a number of small patches of light green powdery (active) corrosion present predominantly on the edges of the blade.



There are other examples on the database that have been discovered in Kingstone, Herefordshire (HESH-5AE5C8) and at Wixford, Warwickshire (WAW-2FC2AE).



From the cutting edge to the broken edge the axe measures 26.4mm, the axe is 54.5mm in width, and is 16.2mm thick. It weighs 65.8 grams.The width of the internal socket is 4.8mm and the length is 32.3 mm.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2014-10-21T23:00:00Z,2014-10-21T23:00:00Z,,,65.8,,,16.2,26.4,1,Victoria Allnatt,Victoria Allnatt,North West,Cheshire East,Cheshire East,Dodcott cum Wilkesley,SJ6143,From finder,52.98291285,-2.58233671,HESH-B9F20D,,HESHB9F20D.jpg,"Bronze Age socketed axe (front, back, profile and plan)",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/vickyallnatt/HESHB9F20D.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/505049.jpg

702266,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1100,"Middle Bronze Age bronze Transitional palstave of Type Roundhay, Midribbed Variant (as defined by Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 149) and of Penard/Wallington metalworking, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Periods 5 -6 and probably dating to 1300 - 1100BC.



The palstave is near-complete with some peripheral damage (with a length of 167mm and a weight of 459.5g). The butt (with a width of 21mm and a thickness of 3.7mm) is moderately straight but bevelled and is possibly truncated on one side. The sides are near-straight and slightly divergent as far as the stop (with a maximum width behind the stop of 27.6mm). The casting seam is only evident on the unlooped side but is possibly masked by corrosion on the looped side. The seam appears to have been neatly fettled. The loop is of D-shaped section (25.0mm long, 12mm wide, 9.4mm high and 3.8mm thick). The sides are flat across their widths and onto the flanges. The flanges begin at the butt and have a linear divergence to the stop but have slight damage to the top edges. The septum is straight and flat and is perpendicular to both the flanges and stops (with a maximum height of 16.1mm). The stops are rounded with a slope to the blade (where the palstave has a maximum thickness of 37.4mm). The sides of the blade narrow below the stop, producing a slight 'nick'. The sides are straight across their widths and gently concave are divergent along their lengths to produce a narrow and moderately rounded blade edge. The original blade edge has been lost but there does not appear to have been any significant loss to the blade tips (with a surviving blade width of 44.6mm). The blade faces are decorated with a single central midrib, which appears as wide as the face below the stop, producing convex faces at the apex, becoming flat near the blade edge. There is a discernible blade facet where the midrib ends. The surface is heavily-corroded with a mid-green corrosion and dark brown exposed metal on edges. There are some areas of active bright green corrosion on both blade faces.



The palstave demonstrates a number of features characteristic of Type Roundhay such as the waisting and the near-parallel sides below the stop. The sides however are also straight and near-parallel above the stop, similar to Type Shelf (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 146). Transitional palstaves are recovered occasionally from South East Wales but are far less well represented than Ewart Park metalwork and may have a different pattern of deposition, with the coastal findspot of this example, perhaps being of significance.

702291,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Bronze Age bronze spearhead of Davis' (2012) Group I form and of Arreton Down metalworking dating to the latest part of the Early Bronze Age, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 4 dated c. 1700 - 1500BC.



The spearhead is near-complete with a distorted tang (with a length of 229mm and a weight of 193.4g). The end of the tang has a separate, circular-sectioned rivet with slightly expanded ends (28.0mm long and 6.6 - 8.1mm diameter and up to 8.8mm diameter for the ends) remaining in-place. The end of the tang is rounded (with a width of 14.1mm, a thickness of 2.3mm and positioned 3mm from the rivet). The tang is rectangular sectioned with near straight sides, slightly narrower above the rivet and gradually thickening towards the blade (with a minimum width of 11.4mm and a maximum thickness of 9.5mm). The blade has bevelled shoulders to give a maximum width near the base (of 42.1mm and a blade length of 156mm). Little of the original blade edge survives but they appear to have been straight and gradually converging to the tip. The spearhead faces have median bevels, giving a lozenge section (with a maximum thickness near the base of 10.7mm). The blade faces are stepped parallel to the edge (7mm from the edge) with an additional blade facet discernible in the better preserved area (2mm from the edge). No applied decoration is evident on the spearhead and there are no sharpening striations discernible. The surface has a mid-green patina with a dark green and blue (possibly azurite) corrosion, some of which appears to be active.



Analysis to ascertain the composition of the metal of both the spearhead and the rivet was attempted using X-ray fluorescence, the results are not semi-quantitative but indicate that the spearhead alloy is an arsenical bronze, while the rivet is a tin bronze with only trace arsenic levels . It is unclear whether different alloys were used for practical reasons or whether the two parts were made at different times.



Tanged spearheads are not a commonly recovered artefact type, with seemingly only four other recorded examples from Wales. Two of the four tanged spearheads were recovered from Penllyn , indicating a highly-significant local clustering for the type. The other two spearheads are from Ystradyfodwg, Rhondda (Savory, 1980, no. 225, p. 111) and from Llanfachreth, Gwynedd (Savory, 1980, no. 336, p. 132). The Glamorgan tanged spearheads are of a similar form to this example but are generally decorated. The Gwynedd spearhead is of a more squat form.

The spear is fragmentary, represented by the upper part only (with a surviving length of 43.4mm and a weight of 10.9g). The top of the circular socket is evident at the base of the fragment (with a diameter of 6.8mm and a depth of 19mm).

703464,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-750,"A small gold Penannular Ring (or so-called 'hair ring') of Late Bronze Age date. The ring has a sub-circular cross section and the ends of the terminals are flat. The ring has alternating decorative banding of yellow and a paler, silver rich gold. There is no visible evidence that the ring had a copper alloy core and the weight of the ring suggests that it may be solid gold.



Analysis by the British Museum's scientific research team has demonstrated that the penannular ring has been modified. A small section of metal has been removed from the edge of each end exposing fresh metal, and the original surfaces of each capped end have also been removed. This is evidenced by the presence of parallel striations and exposure of fresh metal. The appearance of the exposed metal indicates this modification is modern.



Dimensions: 18mm by 17mm diameter; 1.5mm gap between terminals; 6.5mm (max.) and 6mm (min) thickness; weight: 9.47g



Metal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface of the ring by Department of Scientific Research at The British Museum indicated that its composition was consistent with a Late Bronze Age date. See appended report full details of the composition.



Discussion: This ring belongs to a well dated group of ornaments of the Late Bronze Age, circa 1150-750 BC.

703549,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Late Bronze Age socketed spearhead of Davis' (2015) Type 11A, which covers Generic pegged spearheads with flame-shaped blades, dating to the Wilburton or Ewart Park metalworking industry (c.1120-800 BC) (following Needham et al. 1997).



The spearhead is complete and retains the sediment in the socket (with a length of 159mm and with a weight of 144.7g, including sediment and 126.2g without). The socket is near-circular (with a diameter of 27.9mm - 28.6mm, 25.4mm internal and 110.1mm deep). There is no evidence for a lip at the mouth or decoration around the socket. The sides of the circular socket are conical, gradually converging to the tip and define a rounded midrib along the blade. Approximately midway between the mouth and the start of the blade are the sub-circular attachment holes (of 7.2mm and 7.8mm diameter), which are raised or burred on the interior of the socket. The casting seams are evident on both sides but have been neatly fettled and mostly removed but with a discernible ridge surviving. The blade is leaf-shaped and reaches its maximum width approximately one-third of the blade length (with a length of 114mm and a maximum width of 38.3mm). The blade facets are evident and mostly survive (with a length of 4mm and a thickness of 0.6mm). There is the suggestion of some striations running along the blade facets, possibly the result of sharpening. There are striations evident inside the socket (7mm from the mouth). The surface has a dark-brown patina with some areas of pale-brown and green surface loss.



The sediment was removed from the socket in the museum and contained root material but no discernible surviving wooden shaft. A void was observed immediately above the peg holes.



Spearheads of pegged type have been shown to date from Wilburton metalwork, dated from 1150BC, the majority of associated spearheads are found with Ewart Park metalwork (950 - 750BC).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,144.7,,28.6,,159,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,ST0179,From finder,51.50123654,-3.4276731,NMGW-8CD44C,,201471jpg.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed spearhead of Pegged Type,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/201471jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/504313.jpg
703648,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave of Group III, Low-Flanged (Broad blade) Type and of uncertain subtype, possibly a variant of Type Wantage (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, p 133-5) and probably of Acton Park II / Taunton metalworking industries, of Needham's (1996) Period 5; dated to c. 1500 - 1150 BC.



The palstave is unlooped and is near-complete but is heavily corroded (with a length of 159mm and a weight of 438.4g). The butt (with a width of 18.4mm) has broken across one side. The sides are straight and near-parallel, diverging slightly as far as the stop (with a width of 20mm to 25.1mm at the stop). The sides are then concave and divergent to produce a comparatively wide blade. The blade is asymmetric, seemingly differentially worn or damaged on one side (with a blade width of 64.2mm). The casting seams are clearly discernible on both sides but have been neatly finished, surviving as a ridge where the surface is preserved. The flanges begin (9mm) beneath the butt and appear to be damaged and truncated. The more complete flange appears to be moderately straight, reaching its highest point beneath the stop (with a maximum surviving height of 30.4mm). The septum (with a thickness of 8.0mm) is flat across its length and has a slight concavity across its width. The stops appear more rounded on one face than the other (with heights of 8.6mm and 11.7mm). There is a bevel from the stop to the blade faces (where the blade has a thickness of 20.0mm) and the top of the faces is decorated with a subtle depression or sunken shield decoration but is without mouldings. The blade faces are flat and gradually convergent, increasing in convergence near the edge but without a discernible blade facet. The blade edge is comparatively straight. The surface has surviving remnants of a very dark, near-black patina and elsewhere has a pale to mid-green corrosion.



The general form of the palstave would seem to suit Type Wantage, although the absence of decorative mouldings would make the axe a variant of the type. The features would seem 'developed' for an unlooped palstave and if the loop represents a typological progression , this axe may be seen as at the cusp.

703846,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age bronze butt fragment from an axe of uncertain type but of Developed Axe or Palstave form



The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end (with a surviving length of 32.4mm and a weight of 28.4g). The butt end is rounded but may be truncated and thins to an edge (with a width of 19.5mm and a thickness of 0.8mm). The sides are straight and slightly divergent to the break (with a maximum width of 21.9mm and a thickness of 7.7mm). The sides are convex across their thicknesses with the suggestion of a casting seam on the pitted surface. The flanges begin near the butt and are slightly convex along the short length to the break and are probably slightly eroded and truncated (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 9.9mm with a height above the septum of 1mm). The break occurred in antiquity. The surface has a dark-green patina where it survives and is heavily pitted.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form would be consistent with slender-butted Developed flat axes, From Type Aylesford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981) from the Early Bronze Age through to Late Palstaves, of Ewart Park Metalworking in the Late Bronze Age.

703891,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1900,"Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe, possibly a reworked axe or an axe blank probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC



The axe is comparatively short with a wide thick butt (with a length of 82.2mm and a weight of 202.8g). The butt is straight and flat (with a width of 39mm and a thickness of 8.5mm) possibly suggesting the axe may have been reworked from a larger axe. The sides are straight and divergent for a short distance from the butt (approximately 20mm) before becoming concave and diverging to a moderately expanded blade edge (with a surviving width of 61.2mm). The sides are rounded across their thickness. The original blade edge has been lost and the edge is now comparatively straight with only a gentle curve. One of the blade tips has been lost and the axe has a pronounced distortion before the break. One face is flat, while the other is very gently convex across its length and both have a gentle convexity across their widths. There are no discernible developed features on the axe, such as a median bevel or flange. There is the suggestion of a short blade facet (6mm long) although this is more likely to be the result of corrosion and wear. The surface is heavily-corroded with a dark-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion.



The flat axe is an unusual form and appears comparatively short and wide and thick-butted but now shows no evidence of breakage, possibly suggesting the butt has been reworked. The lack of any of any surviving developed features and the simple, curved-sided form to the axe may be suggestive of Type Migdale (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44) , of Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC. The axe also may be an axe-blank and the unworked flat face may demonstrates minimal working subsequent to its casting.

703897,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"Late Bronze Age socketed tool, probably a hammer, probably of Late Bronze Age date c. 1000-700BC.



The tool is incomplete missing the mouth (with a length of 65.5mm and a weight of 101.1g) and has broken in antiquity. At the break, the socket mouth is of oval form (with an internal dimensions of 12.4mm x 11.1mm and with a surviving depth of 28.9mm). The tool is thicker on the more complete side (with a thickness of 3.6mm compared to 1.7mm). Each side had at least two linear stepped mouldings along its length (with a depth of up to 2.5mm). The sides are convergent, with the stepped mouldings retaining a fairly consistent width (with a width before the top step of 18mm, a width at the top step of 19.7mm, a width before the basal step of 17.1mm and a width at the basal step of 22.3mm). The sides are straight and near-parallel at the basal section (24.8mm long with a width and thickness at the platform of 23.3mm and 14.0mm respectively). The casting seams are clearly evident and slightly raised on both sides and are significantly off-centre along its thickness. Both faces are flat across their lengths and slightly convergent to the platform (with a thickness at the break of 15.9mm) but have a gentle convexity across their widths. There is no decoration surviving on either face. The platform is sub-rectangular (22.4mm x 13.3mm) and is convex with no discernible evidence of significant battering scars. The surface is worn with a dark-brown patina and areas of mid-to-dark-green corrosion. The faces have a few scratches preserved beneath the patina.","Bronze Age socketed hammers are not frequently reported, with 26 examples reported to PAS at the time of writing. The stepped sides of this example are difficult to parallel. Fregni (2014, 81ff.) has recently presented a typology of socketed hammers and this example falls within her Type 4 categorised by a slanted face, shoulders, a square or round cross section and generally smaller size than other hammers. Only one other Type 4 has so far been identified in England and Wales, which is from the large multi-period Salisbury hoard, Wiltshire. This hoard also contained three other types of socketed hammer. Due to the eclectic nature of the Salisbury hoard, which contains objects from the Early Bronze Age through to the Middle Iron Age, it is difficult to accurately date this type of hammer.



However, two similar shouldered hammers are present in Dowris phase hoards in Ireland. One was found in the Dowris hoard itself (Eogan 1983, No.119 (78)) and another in the Lusmagh hoard (Eogan 1983, No.22 (1). These hoards equate to the Ewart Park phase in England and Wales (c.950-750 BC), suggesting this as the most likely date for the Pembrokeshire hammer. However, none of these examples have a double-shoulder.



Four other hammers are recorded from Wales at present, two from North Wales; one from the Bronze Age occupation soil behind the rampart of the hillfort at the Breiddin (D.G. Coombs 1991 in Musson ed., mo. 139, 3 133-4) , the Breiddin hammer is of sub-quadrangular form and is expanded at the working platform, and an unpublished example from Burton, Wrexham (Gwilt pers. comm.) and is more rounded in form. Two quadrangular hammers from Wales have been recorded with PAS recently, a fragmentary example from Swansea (NMGW-46A3A3) and a more complete example from Brecon (NMGW-475C27). Hammers often have a higher tin content in the bronze (Coombs ibid.; Evans; 1881 ) compared to contemporary axes. It has not been possible to analyse this example quantitatively but X-ray fluorescence surface analysis has indicated a leaded bronze with trace levels of arsenic and silver (Mary Davis pers. Comm. (XRF 998)).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,101.1,,,,65.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Wenke Domscheit,,Pembrokeshire,,,,,,,NMGW-B31642,,2014100jpg.jpg,"Late Bronze Age socketed tool, probably a hammer",All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/2014100jpg.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/504562.jpg

The axe is near-complete but is very heavily corroded (with a length of 132.3mm and a weight of 255.5g). The butt (with a width of 21.4mm and a thickness of 2.5mm) is moderately straight and is likely to have suffered some erosion. The sides are straight and divergent as far as the blade (where the axe has a width of 28.1mm). The cast flanges appear to begin just before the butt and are convex across their heights (reaching a maximum surviving height of 20.8mm) and appear to have had a regular curve, producing an oval side profile. The septum appears moderately flat with no surviving evidence for a median bevel. The sides are 'nicked' (with a width of 32.0mm and a thickness of 10.5mm) immediately below the flanges, below which the sides are concave and divergent to the blade edge. The casting seams are no longer evident. One of the blade tips has been lost (producing a surviving blade width of 53.5mm). There is no decorative device now evident on either blade face. The blade faces are gently convex across their widths, with the possible suggestion of a mid-ridge and are flat and convergent across their lengths before converging more sharply to the blade edge but without discernible blade facets. The surface is very poorly preserved with a small remnants surviving on the septum and blade with a dark-brown patina; elsewhere the surface has corroded pale-to mid-green and brown.



The loss of subtle surface features makes typological identification difficult, the general form however is consistent with Type Kirtomy, Early Short Flanged axes and the noticeable nicked sides may suggest the variant Arnhall.

704891,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Early Bronze Age bronze Developed Flat Axe of uncertain type, possibly Type Bandon or similar and of Willerby metalworking, c. 1900 - 1700BC





The axe is fragmentary, represented by an approximate blade half and has broken in antiquity (with a surviving length of 54.0mm and a weight of 94.6g). At the break, the axe has a rectangular section with a comparatively slender blade (25.6mm wide and 10.8mm thick) and displays evidence that the axe was bent prior to breaking. The sides are convex across their widths and near-straight or gently convex across the surviving length and divergent before sharply out-turning to produce an expanded and well-curved blade edge. The blade tips and original blade edge have been damaged (giving a surviving blade width of 44.7mm). Beneath the break, both faces were decorated with crude linear incised lines. There is no suggestion of flanges on the surviving part of the blade. Both faces have a discernible blade facet, corresponding with the recurving of the blade (15mm from the blade edge). The surface is corroded with some deep pitting and a mid-green patina and areas of pale-green corrosion.



The fragmentary state of the axe makes typological identification difficult but the slender blade form and out-turned blade may suggest an axe of Type Bandon or allied axe, as defined by Schmidt & Burgess (1981, p 65-48) . Schmidt & Burgess (ibid) note the lack of associations between Type Bandon and other axes and tentatively suggest that they may be of Stage V, Willerby metalworking, corresponding to the latter part of Needham's (1996) Period 3, (c. 2,050 - 1,700BC), perhaps suggesting a date of c. 1900 - 1700BC.

705472,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age bronze blade, possibly a dirk of Group IV blade with a damaged butt.





The dirk is incomplete with some peripheral damage to the butt (with a length of 124.3mm and a weight of 29.3g). The shoulders are eroded but appear to have been comparatively broad (with a surviving width of 48.2mm) and is better preserved on one side. The original form of the hilt is now uncertain although it may have been of trapezoidal form with differential corrosion to the apex of the butt, which now has convergent sides. There are no definite rivet holes evident but there is a notch at the central apex, which may have aided the hafting or attachment. The butt is thinned (with a thickness at the apex of 0.6mm) and may have been reworked. Below the shoulders, the sides are concave and convergent (for approximately 26mm). The blade is then near straight and convergent (for approximately 17mm with a width of 26-18mm) after which, the blade is straight and only slightly convergent before the tip. The blade is of lozenge section and gradually thickens to reach a maximum near the tip (of 4.1mm). The blade edge has been lost and is now rounded. The surface is heavily-pitted and corroded with a dark-brown to black patina and with an area of pale-green corrosion. There is no surviving evidence for a hilt mark on the surface



The corrosion makes it difficult to confidently identify the blade typologically with the scheme as outlined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981) but would seem to best fit the Group IV weapons with damaged or reworked butts. Group IV blades belong to Taunton to Penard Metalworking industry of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC.

707457,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Middle Bronze Age bronze blade, possibly a dirk of Group II or III blade with a damaged butt





The dirk is incomplete with some peripheral damage to the butt and upper part of the blade (with a length of 135.2mm and a weight of 32.6 g). The top edge of the butt is damaged and irregular, with a number of arcs, possibly related to rivet holes but none of which may now be identified with any certainty. The dirk is thinnest at the butt (with a thickness of 0.8mm) and is widest across the eroded shoulders (with a surviving width of 38.7mm). The original form of the hilt is now uncertain but there is a clear midrib on the blade, which begins comparatively near the end of the dirk (at approximately 12mm), possibly suggesting that most of the butt has been lost or possibly that the blade is reworked. The blade gradually narrows from the shoulders, giving the dirk something of a triangular form, rather than the wide-butted and slender-bladed types. The blade edges appear to have been more sharply convergent (for c. 32mm from the butt), before being more gently convergent but still straight and then converging with an arc to the tip (for c. 19mm). Both faces are very heavily-corroded, masking the detail but the midrib is evident on both faces (giving the dirk a maximum thickness of 3.0mm below the shoulders) and there is the suggestion of blade facets. The pitting on the surface has penetrated the bronze in areas and the surviving surface has a dark-brown to black patina and with an area of brown and grey corrosion. There is no surviving evidence for a hilt mark on the surface



The corrosion and fragmentary, eroded butt makes it difficult to confidently identify the blade typologically within the scheme as outlined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981) but would seem to best fit the Group II to III weapons. It is also very possible that the blade has been reworked. Group II to III blades belong to Acton Park II and Taunton Metalworking industry of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC.

The axe is fragmentary and damaged, missing the blade and part of the mouth and is partially filled with sediment (with a surviving length of 78.4mm and a weight of 101.6g). The socket mouth is circular and incomplete, with a little over half remaining (with a diameter of 33.0mm). Below the socket, the mouth is concave (for 11mm) before a moulding, producing the characteristic 'trumpet-shaped collar'. The loop springs from below the moulding (with a length of 21mm) and has been distorted with a blow to its midpoint, producing an undulating form. The looped side is more complete and is concave across its length, expanding towards the missing blade (with a maximum surviving width 28.0mm and a width below the loop of 25.5mm). The casting seam is evident running along the preserved side and has been finished. The body of the axe has a number of facets, seemingly twelve, which characterise the axe type. The blade of the axe appears to have been removed and significant battering above the break has closed the socket at the break (giving a thickness at the break of 11.8mm). The mouth has also received a blow, causing a part of the body to be folded into the socket. The split continues to the break at the base and has also received a significant blow above the blade. The surface is corroded and worn with a light-brown corrosion overlying a black patina.","The axe demonstrates clear evidence of deliberate damage, apparently to the mouth, the loop in addition to the faces and sides of the blade. Faceted axes have been recorded from a Late Wilburton hoard in Co. Roscommon, indicating a possible date for the type from the transition of the Wilburton-Wallington and Ewart Park metalworking phases.

708729,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1200,"Middle Bronze Age bronze blade, possibly a dirk of Group II blade with a damaged butt.



The dirk is incomplete with some peripheral damage to the butt and some distortion (with a length of 131.4mm and a weight of 19.7g). The shoulders are eroded but are probably close to their original width (with a surviving width of 39.2mm). The original form of the hilt is now uncertain and there are no definitive arcs from rivet holes present along the edges although it is possible to suggest an arc at the apex, towards the more complete shoulder side. The butt is thinned (with a thickness at the apex of 0.8mm) and may have been reworked. Below the shoulders, the sides are gently concave (for 24mm) before becoming near-straight and convergent (for approximately 82mm) before converging more sharply above the tip. The blade outline is comparatively triangular and perhaps suggests a Group II blade. The blade section is now difficult to determine with no midrib or mid-ridge discernible although there is the tentative suggestion of ephemeral surface marks or facets. The blade achieves a maximum thickness (of 2.3mm) below the butt and gradually thins to the tip (at 1.4mm thick).



The blade edges have been lost and are now rounded on one edge and stripped on the other. The original surface has been lost and the metal is heavily-corroded with a grey-brown to black patina and with areas of pale-green corrosion. There is no surviving evidence for a hilt mark on the surface.","The blade has bowed slightly along its length in both directions so it has a low wave-like side profile. Due to the thin nature of the blade, this could be the result of soil warping or another post-depositional process. Alternatively, it may be the result of heat warping, as seen on burnt Early Bronze Age daggers, or deliberately distortion by some other means. The poor surface condition is indicative of burning damage.



The corrosion and peripheral damage makes it difficult to confidently identify the blade typologically with the scheme as outlined by Burgess and Gerloff (1981) but the triangular form would seem to best fit the Group II weapons with damaged or reworked butts. Group II have a suggested date range spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age transition (ibid., p 45), and largely belong to Acton Park Metalworking industry but continue into Taunton Metalworking, corresponding with Needham's (1996) Period 4 - 5, and perhaps can be dated to c. 1600 - 1200BC.

The spearhead is near-complete with peripheral damage to the mouth and tip (with a length of 103.9mm and a weight of 66.0g). The socket is circular (with an internal diameter of 17.2mm and an external diameter of 20.2mm) and has a rounded step just above the mouth. The socket has not been completely cleaned-out (and has a current depth of 23mm) and contains bronze corrosion. The sides of the socket are near-straight and convergent towards the blade. The loops are flat topped of sub-lozenge shape (14mm long by 6mm wide), which begin 21mm from the socket mouth. The perforations beneath the loops are slender and oval, containing sediment (4.0-5.7mm long and 2mm high). Both sides have a ridge, running between the mouth and the loop and between the top of the loop and the base of the blade, resulting from the careful finishing of the casting seams. There appear to be decorative grooves flanking the loops.



The short blade can be described as ""kite-shaped"" (with a maximum width near its base of 23.0mm and a length of 48mm) with flat blade edges. The socket continues into the blade as a narrowing and more angular midrib. Weak blade facets are discernible but are now worn. The spearhead has been very neatly finished with no casting flashes evident. The surface of the spearhead is preserved with a dark green patina. Deep sharpening striations are evident beneath the patina running along both sides of the blade and onto the midrib on both faces.","Davis (2012, 53f.) presents plain side-looped spearheads with a kite-shaped blade as his Group 4 for Britain. These are further sub-divided into two types, based on the overall size of the spearhead and the shape of the loop plates. The present examples can be classed as Type 4A due to it being over 90mm and having lozenge-shaped loop plates. Davis (2012) records 21 Type 4A spearheads, though this example is the first from a secure context in Wales. Previously, one was known from the Museum of Aberystwyth, but without any provenance. A spearhead of a similar form was found at Marbury cum Quoisley in Cheshire (PAS LVPL-69F851).



A similar side-looped spearhead was found in the Thames at Mortlake, now in the Museum of London , and had remnants of the wooden shaft surviving.

The axe is of 'Baggy' form and is incomplete, missing the mouth and loop (with a surviving length of 55.5mm and a weight of 74.8g with the wood in the socket and 73.3g without). The top of the axe has broken or is eroded, probably just below the mouth. The mouth is oval to sub-rectangular (31.4mm wide and 25.1mm deep). The socket is rectangular (21.7mm x 13.6mm and 36.8mm deep) and when reported, contained the distorted wooden remains, probably of the handle. After the removal of the wood, no internal ribs were identified at the base of the socket. The poor preservation of the wood has made it difficult to obtain a species identification. There is a horizontal collar moulding, now heavily worn, positioned at the top of the loop. The loop has mostly been lost, with only the basal stubs now surviving (with a length of 17.0mm). The casting seams are evident on both sides and appear to have been finished. The sides are near-straight, only very gently concave and parallel for approximately half their lengths before diverging to produce a moderately expanded blade edge (with a width of 37.1mm). The axe has an oval to sub-rectangular body section (31.0mm x 16mm below the loop) without any facets. The faces are convex across their widths and comparatively flat across their lengths, converging more sharply above the blade but without a discernible blade facet. The original surface has been lost and is striped and heavily-pitted with a pale-green corrosion.","The truncated mouth makes precise typological identification difficult. The axe has the 'baggy' form, of types well represented in Ireland. The axe would appear to best fit Eogan's (2000, p 20-30) Class 2 A or B with a suggested date range from the 11th to 9th centuries BC (ibid, p 30). Axes of type 2 have a distribution largely in the northern half of Ireland, although examples are recorded from as far south as Cork (ibid. pl. 113B).

The sides are straight and near-parallel as far as the stop and is comparatively slender (at 25.0mm wide and 25.4mm wide at the stop). The sides are not nicked below the stop but are concave and divergent to produce a moderately expanded blade edge but has lost one of the blade tips (with a surviving width of 59.7mm) and has also lost the original blade edge. There was no loop and the casting seams are evident on both sides and have ben finished, probably by hammering. The flanges begin below the butt (approximately 13mm) and are now truncated but are straight, gradually rising towards the stop (where the axe has a maximum thickness of 22.1mm) but do not continue onto the blade. The septum has a slight concavity across its width and has a consistent thickness. The stop has a gentle curve and is slightly undercut (with a height above the septum of 8.2mm and 6mm above the blade). Below the stop on the blade is a shallow shield-shaped depression (21mm long), characteristic of the palstave type. The blade is convex across both its width and length. There is the suggestion of two weak blade facets and discernible hammer marks are present on the lower part of the blade. Sharpening striations are evident running off the blade edge. The surface has a dark-brown patina with more recent surface damage and loss with a bright green corrosion. The surface has been treated by the finder, possibly altering the patina colour.","The axe is an early example of the palstave form and it has been argued (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pp. 125) that North-East Wales and the Marches was the source of this form of axe type.

The blade is incomplete and fragmentary, in two pieces (the upper fragment has a length and weight of 75.2mm and 25.2g respectively, the lower part is similarly 39.6mm and 8.5g, with a combined dimensions of 110.9mm and 33.7g). The butt or hilt is missing with no evidence for rivet holes or a tang but the top of the blade does not appear to be widening (with a width of 17.2mm). The blade has a prominent rounded midrib of consistent width and thickness (of 4.0mm width and 4.0mm thick). The original blade edges have been lost but the surviving edge is comparatively straight (with a maximum surviving width of 24.8mm) for most of its surviving length. The blade appears to taper near one end (from approximately 39mm) and is likely to have been approaching the missing tip. There is the suggestion of a slight step from the midrib to the blade and the blade profile appears to be slightly convex. There is clear suggestion of a bend prior to breaking at the fracture. The surface is heavily corroded with dark-green patina and with suggestions of sharpening striations.","
The following comment has been offered by Mr Matt Knight (pers. comm.):



Bent and broken blades are known throughout the Bronze Age, with fragmentation particularly common in the Late Bronze Age. The form of this is blade is suggestive of a Late Bronze Age form, perhaps the lower blade of a sword. The breakage into several pieces, as well as the associated bend, may indicate this damage was the result of intent. However, bending and breakage has been known to occur through use.

The shaft of the pin is complete and tapers to a sharp point at the distal (furthest) end, it is circular in cross section. The shaft is bent at the point where it meets the head of the pin. The pin shaft angles to the right towards the distal end of the pin. The head of the pin is circular in plan and circular in cross section, and is complete. It has an external diameter of 27.4 mm and an internal diameter of 20.6 mm. The pin is undecorated but does show evidence of silvering on the surface.



The pin measures 78.7 mm in length, and the head has a diameter of 27.4 mm. It has a thickness of 3.4 mm and weighs 6.4 g.



The pin is a mid brown in colour, with evidence of silvering in places, mostly on the front of the pin at the proximal (closest, or head) end. It has an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement in the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



Dr Eleanor Blakelock (Birmingham Museums Trust) tested three areas on the pin using a Mistral Tabletop XRF machine. The areas tested were: a silvered area, a cleaned area that revealed silver from the surface layers, and the final area was further down the pin to assess the core metal composition. The XRF results would indicate that the pin has been silvered.

The narrowness of the blade and thickness at the break are perhaps more similar to chisels such as NMS-894E92, SF2649 and SOMDOR-7B3C43 on this database, but it does not seem to have the horizontal sides of the more common chisel form, as seen on SF-09D1D5 and SUSS-D93644 on this database. However, small, narrow-bladed palstaves belonging to the Taunton phase (1400-1300 BC) of metalworking or possibly to the slightly earlier Acton Park II period, (c.1500-1400 BC); (both corresponding with Needham's period 5, 1500 - 1150 CAL BC) are also similar, especially in the rapid thickening from blade to break. It was perhaps similar to SOM-1DE687, HAMP-996311 or the axeheads in GLO-6535E4. Further arguments on either side are given in SOM-2B70A5.

Both sides of the palstave have high developed flanges, which increase gradually from the butt to from sub-triangular sides. 



The faces of the axe fragment are slightly concave, creating a H-shaped cross-section. There is a large casting flaw on one face, in the form of an air bubble.

718052,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Copper alloy blade. Cast blade from a short stabbing rapier or dagger; possibly the former reduced to the latter by sharpening over a prolonged period. Dot Boughton kindly advised upon the identification and dating of the object. The blade has a rounded end tapering to a point with sharp sides. The section is lentoid, and thinned by sharpening which has introduced a waisted form to its mid section. The blade expands towards the hilt, with sloped shoulders and a tang of rectangular section which is torn at a single drilled hole of diameter 4.5mm which appears to have cut across the U-shaped end of the tang. This may be damage from loss of plates forming a handle, or may relate to its repair.



The thickness noted at the tang may continue along the blade to about half way along it as a species of mid rib, though there are no other features to show this was a deliberately formed or maintained feature. Fine diagonal striations appear along both sides of the blade; this might be taken as further evidence for sharpening in antiquity, followed by deposition in extremely favourable conditions for the preservation of the surface of the metal. The edges of the blade remain sharp. However, the finder is an enthusiastic cleaner and refurbisher of his artefacts, so some or all of this evidence may be of recent date. Some pale green pitting on the upper part of the blade appears to be of some age, though the smoothing of surfaces around it may not be. The lower part of the blade is slightly up-turned. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC.

719527,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-750,"A fragment of a cast bronze (copper alloy) socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 750 BC). The axe is incomplete; it is missing the mouth and upper part of the socket including the loop and is broken below the mid-point. Due to the damage classification is difficult. It is likely that this axe fits within the socketed and faceted axe typology probably associated with the Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and earlier phases of the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-750 CAL. BC.



The axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a slightly flared / expanded, convex, but much abraded, cutting edge. In profile the fragment is sub-triangular / wedge shaped. The socket is also sub-rectangular in cross section with the side walls tapering evenly to a narrow rectangular base. The depth of the socket from the edge of the break to base of socket is 6.7mm. The broken edges are all well abraded and patinated suggesting the damage is old. Both the casting seams (which run down the sides of the axe) show signs of finishing (being trimmed and flattened). The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is relatively poorly preserved. The blade edge has been lost through abrasion and corrosion. The axe fragment is a mid brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost leaving light green / grey corrosion visible.



The axe fragment measures 24.4mm long, 42mm wide, 13.3mm thick and is 36.69g. The walls are 3.6mm to 5mm thick.

719542,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1500,"A cast copper alloy flat axe dating from the Early Bronze Age, that is about 2150 - 1500 BC. The axe is narrow with straight but tapering sides and there are no signs of a stop ridge. The butt is missing but would have been narrow. It has a very slightly flared convex cutting edge. The sides of the axe are very slightly thickened, but it does not have flanges. The surface, particularly the cutting edge, is pitted and corroded though the remaning surface has a smooth, deep green patina. The break at the butt end is equally patinated. The axe is 19.7mm wide at the break. The axe probably fits into the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC, or slightly later. The axe is 83mm long, 37.1mm wide and 6mm thick. 87.4g. The blade facets are about 7.5mm from the cutting edge to the flat face of the axe.

719701,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"A complete cast bronze (copper alloy) faceted socketed axe (axehead) of Late Bronze Age date (950 - 750 BC). The axe is elegantly cast being relatively slender and well proportioned with a trumpet shaped collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade.



The mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section. The shape of the mouth is sub-rectangular (rectangular with rounded corners) at measures 33.25mm wide. The trumpet-shaped mouth of the axe tapers and the loop is relatively small in a low position set well beneath the collar. Directly above the loop is a cast decorative circumferential ridge The loop is D-shaped in cross section (5.95mm wide). The upper body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The lower section of the axe flares to form an elegantly expanding blade (38.3mm wide). The casting flashes on the sides of the axe are still visible and have not been finished. The cutting edge itself is abraded, although the crescent shaped edge is regular suggesting little evidence of wear / sustained use. Apart from the grooves below the collar there is no evidence of other ornament on the axe.

719742,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete fragment from a much eroded cast bronze (copper alloy) rapier of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1150BC). The fragment consists of part of the lower blade a rapier, the tip has been previously recorded (HESH-3B6C58) and was recovered by a different finder from the same field. The two blade pieces conjoin and should therefore be considered as part of the same artefact. The fragment is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with one end being slightly tapered. A central ridge / mid rib runs along the length of the fragment on both faces. The rapier fragment is a mid-green colour with an uneven and eroded surface patina. The breaks are abraded therefore it is problematic to suggest if the rapier was deliberately broken prior to deposition or if it has been broken by farm machinery in the plough soil. However, this fragment in profile is noticeably bent, so it could be likely that the object has been purposefully bent before deposition. This could suggest that the object was subjected to a ritual process before being placed in the ground. The findspot looks to be close to the edge of a large mere or area of historic wetland - possibly suggesting that if this rapier were ritually disposed of it was then placed at a liminal boundary; this is a common feature of wetland deposition in prehistoric Britain. A direct parallel for the rapier blade cannot be attributed due to the fragmentary nature and lack of diagnostic features and so a broad Middle Bronze Age date is suggested.



The fragment measures 51.4mm in length, 18.0m width and is 17.4mm thick. It weighs 23.7 grams.

719838,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete copper alloy, probable side looped and socketed spearhead, of Middle Bronze Age dating (1500 BC to 1150 BC).



Around 25% of the spearhead is present, consisting of the central section. The base, blade and point are missing, presumed lost in antiquity.



The spearhead fragment is a hollow sub conical tube. At the top, the base of the blade is present. Below this, on both sides are 5 small horizontal grooves. The side loops are positioned underneath these grooves, and would have been sub lozenge in shape. The top of the socket is circular.



It measures 47.3 mm in length. It has a minimum diameter of 11.0 mm (top) and a maximum of 15.0 mm (base). The side loops have a length of 17.5 mm. The walls of the spearhead are 1.9 mm thick. It weighs 16.5 g.



The spearhead fragment is a mid to dark brown with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.

720229,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy ribbed socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 800 BC). The object can be classified as fitting into the Ewart Park phase of metalwork.



The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with the cutting edge expanding outwards. The cutting edge of the axe is missing and the break is patinated, though perhaps to a less extent than the rest of the axe. The broken edges are not worn. This break may be intentional and may indicate ritual deposition.



The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 29.22mm, internal length 28mm, external width 40.5mm, external length 39.3mm and the wall of the mouth is 5 - 5.7mm thick). The socket is over 78mm deep and the insides are smooth. Four casting runners can be felt round the edeg of the mouth.



A moulded collar decorates the axe about 15mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs on each of the two main faces, measuring 25mm - 30mm in length and about 2mm wide.



Along the centre of each side of the axe is a trimmed but raised casting seam. The seams have not been filed down. One side of the axe has a large semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 10.5mm in width and 22mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section.



The axe has a mid green to dark grey patina and the surface is smooth. Overall, the axe is 77.9mm long, 42.4mm wide and 39.3mm thick. 164g.



The object can be classified as belonging to the Ewart park phase of metal work which corresponds with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC.

723429,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"Middle or Late Bronze Age date (1500 - 800 BC) socketed spear (spearhead): The copper alloy spearhead consists of the upper portion of the spear, being broken just as the socket starts. In plan the spearhead is a sub-lozenge with abraded blade facets, thereby being misshapen. The tip is also abraded and missing. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a bi-convex shaped cross section. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is circular. The break at this point is not recent. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has traces of a dark brown patina, otherwise the surface is pitted and abraded. It measures 45.72mm long, 11mm wide, 8.14mm thick and weighs 8.2g.



It is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-04-23T23:00:00Z,2015-04-23T23:00:00Z,,,8.2,,,8.14,45.72,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Stratford-on-Avon,Spernall,SP0962,From finder,52.25609923,-1.86957146,WAW-71CFCF,,WAW71CFCF.jpg,Bronze Age spearhead (profile and plan).,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW71CFCF.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/519838.jpg
723431,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A complete though worn copper alloy chisel or trunnion tool of middle Bronze Age date (1500 -1150 BC). The object is sub-rectangular in plan and section, tapering in width from cutting edge to butt. At the midpoint worn semi-circular lug like projections/trunnions extend to either side. The object is eroded by plough roll/abrasion.



The metal has a mid-green patina and is worn. The chisel is 88.5mm long, 12.9mm tapering to 3.8mm wide, 5.5mm tapering to 2.9mm thick and weighs 23.6g.



A similar example has been recorded as HESH-51B7E2 in which it states that such tools are dated to the metalworking tradition phase VIII - IX, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 5 circa 1500-1150 CAL. BC. This record also cites a number of published examples such as from Yattendon Berks (Evans 1881: p169 Fig. 196) and Harbledon, Kent (Rowlands 1976 cat no 1108 p 351/pl36). The latter reference also suggests the date range for these as being from the early Middle Bronze Age with a peak in the Middle Bronze Age with a few examples turning up within assemblages of late Bronze Age date (ibid p44). A distinct pattern of distribution is suggested in the West and in Ireland (ibid) with examples of these being discovered in Shropshire, Cheshire and Wrexham, specifically within the Meole Brace (Edgebold Brickyard) Hoard (Rowlands 1976 after Chitty 1925) and Broxton Cheshire (Evans 1881; 169) and now the Burton Hoard PAS-5B1745.

Discussion:



The three fragments are likely to be from the same sword. Certainly the broken edges of fragments 1 and 2 re-fit together, and all three fragments are in a similar condition and are fragmented to a similar size. There are no casting flaws visible in the breaks, nor deliberate signs of bending often seen in ceremonial use. The sword is likely to have been broken deliberately as it is unlikely to have broken into uniform fragments through use. Overall the sword was probably broken up as part of the reduction process for recycling (pers comm, M Knight, November 2015).","It is probable that these objects formed a single original deposit. This material is eligible as Treasure under the new Treasure Order (2002) being a base-metal prehistoric find containing two or more metal objects.

The axe is represented by a butt fragment only, broken at one end (with a surviving length of 30.4mm and a weight of 28.3g). The butt end is damaged and jagged but may have been rounded and thins to the edge (with a width of 20mm and a thickness of 1.8mm). The sides are near-straight and divergent for their short lengths to the break (with a maximum width of 27.7mm and a thickness across the septum of 8.1mm). The sides are rounded and convex across their thicknesses, with the suggestion of a casting seam on the heavily-corroded and pitted surface. The flanges begin just below the butt and are have a linear divergent edge (giving the axe a maximum surviving depth of 12.8mm with a maximum height above the septum of 2.5mm). The break occurred in antiquity. The surface has a bright and green corrosion.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult.

1. Penannular ring (PRN 32821)
Maximum external diameter (side to side) 19.5mm; maximum diameter of bar (top to bottom) 6.3-6.5mm; weight 18.75g.



This is a complete and small penannular ring decorated with a silvery gold inlayed strip. The ring is of solid gold bar construction and was made of a straight, round sectioned bar, which was bent round into a penannular shape. Around the gold core, a silvery strip was inlaid in continuous spiral fashion to provide a striped colour effect, with seven stripes around each face. The silvery gold stripes are relatively wide, 1.3mm wide on the interior side and 3.0-3.5mm wide on the exterior surface. They are visible as darker areas of surface pitting, caused by the differential corrosion of the silver within this alloy. One side of the ring has been differentially worn during its life and the inset stripes of silvery gold have completely worn away, exposing continuous areas of gold. Some striations on the outer surfaces of the penannular ring were probably caused after burial and during more recent disturbance in the soil.

5. Spatulate ended tool (PAS 2013/028/001)



Length 79.5mm; width of spatulate end 5.3mm; weight 25.3g.



This is a square-sectioned copper alloy tool with a flat top. It tapers and thins at the opposite end, in both planes, expanding again slightly to form a spatulate shaped working end. This has a rounded, but asymmetric end profile. The tool bends in side view, from near the midpoint along its length and towards the spatulate shaped working end. Surfaces are etched with a brown patination and there are localised surface grey-green coloured corrosion patches.



The penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997). However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier development and longer period of manufacture and circulation has been growing (e.g. Raftery 2004, 87-8; Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). Therefore, on comparative stylistic grounds, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).



It is possible to be confident that the large ingot fragment (No. 2 above) is part of a plano-convex ingot or cake of Late Bronze Age date. Its convex underside, thinning to margins indicating an oval shape in plan view and of a size consistent with others viewed, together with the presence of interior vesicles, provide some morphological support for this identification. Moreover, metallurgical analysis has demonstrated the ingot to be of copper with a small lead component and trace antimony and arsenic presences, again consistent with other recently tested Late Bronze Age ingot discoveries from west Wales. Its worn surfaces and breaks suggest that the ingot was disturbed from its original burial context by recent farming activity, having eroded at a shallow depth (10-13cm) within a cultivated and aerated soil for some time. The same disturbed and dispersed location is likely to be true for the penannular ring, also found at shallow depth (7-8cm). However, being of gold, this artefact was not prone to erosion and corrosion in the same way.



The two probable small ingot fragments (Nos. 3 & 4) are not large enough to retain diagnostic morphological features, permitting certain identification as plano-convex ingots in their own right. However, the presence of interior vesicles and very similar worn state is consistent with the larger ingot fragment, and their geographical location within the same field and less than 200m apart do tend to support their identification as probable small plano-convex ingot fragments of Late Bronze Age date. Their metallurgical composition - copper with small lead components and trace antimony and arsenic presences - is also the same as that of the large ingot fragment (No. 2), providing further supporting evidence for this interpretation. Their dispersal from each other and the penannular ring and their worn state also suggest relatively recent disturbance from the original burial context, and erosion at shallow depths (10-13cm) within a cultivated and aerated soil.



Cake ingots are known in hoards of the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-950 BC), with examples from Wales found within the Guilsfield, Powys hoard (Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38). However, plano-convex ingots of copper and bronze are much more common components of Ewart Park hoards of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). Over 40 Ewart Park hoards, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan 1 and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex bronze ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004b; 2008). In the light of the dating evidence for plano-convex ingots, the combined evidence suggests that the penannular ring and ingots were probably buried together as a hoard during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). In other words, both penannular rings and plano-convex ingots were being made and in circulation at this same time.

The spatulate ended tool (No. 5 above; PAS (GAT) 2013/028/001) with a square-sectioned shaft, discovered and reported subsequently to the penannular ring and ingots and from the north east corner of the same field, has proven impossible, at the current time, to relate and parallel with similar artefacts of demonstrable Late Bronze Age date. Metallurgical analysis has indicated it is made of copper, with a significant presence of bismuth. While copper is potentially consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, the presence of bismuth at the levels seen is felt to be anomalous for this period, making a post-medieval date more likely. On the current balance of evidence, this artefact cannot be confidently interpreted as once a directly associated and a contemporary component of this Late Bronze Age hoard.



~~The spatulate ended tool (No. 5) cannot, on the balance of the evidence available, be associated with the hoard: no close Late Bronze Age parallels can be found, while its metal composition does not match the ingots (Nos. 2-4) or the common signature of Late Bronze Age artefact signatures. Therefore, it is my opinion that this object cannot be considered as treasure.","Metallurgical analysis (MD & AG)



Results



The penannular ring had a composition of approximately 78.5% gold, 17.5% silver and 3% copper.

The three ingot fragments were found to be of copper, with small lead components and trace arsenic and antimony presences. The spatulate ended tool was of copper, with a presence of bismuth detected.



Interpretation



The composition of the penannular ring was consistent with comparable Middle to Late Bronze Age gold compositions, with small amounts of copper deliberately alloyed with the gold at this time to improve its colour properties. The approximately 3% of copper detected suggests it registered from within the gold and is consistent with the suggestion that the ring is of solid gold bar construction.



Copper with a small lead component is a typical composition for plano-convex ingots of Late Bronze Age date and paralleled in many Late Bronze Age hoards containing an ingot component. The absence of zinc within any of the ingots provides no evidence to support a Roman or later date of manufacture.



The level of bismuth registering within the spatulate ended tool is regarded as being too high for a metal of Late Bronze Age date. This composition is more characteristic of an artefact and technology of probable post-medieval date.",3,Gold,Copper alloy,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-05-15T23:00:00Z,,2013TW13,,,,,,,5,Adam Gwilt,Adam Gwilt,Wales,Isle of Anglesey,Isle of Anglesey,Cwm Cadnant,SH5875,From a paper map,53.25295572,-4.12991271,NMGW-04216C,,DH007017_01.jpg,"Late Bronze Age hoard from Cwm Cadnant Community, Anglesey",National Museum Wales ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH007017_01.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/521622.jpg
727618,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of two ribbed socketed axes.



1. Ribbed socketed axe - Croxton Type / Class B Southern English ribbed axe



Dimensions: maximum length 102.9mm; blade width 51.3mm; combined weight (including socketed axe fragment 2) 420.8g.



This is a complete and slender socketed axe with a flared trumpet shaped mouth and a wide collar band. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section with slightly concave sides expanding to a widened and curved cutting edge. The mouth of the axe is deep, front to back, and of sub-rectangular shape with curved corners. The mouth tops surface is flat with no clear indication of runner stubs or scars. Two ribs and two edge ribs, all near parallel, descend from the base of the collar band, extending approximately half way down the axe faces. A wide loop descends from the lower side of the collar band, while the casting seams have been carefully removed, probably by filing and hammering down each side of the axe. On the blade bevel, surface striations parallel to the cutting edge are evident, indicating the blade was sharpened for use. The axe has a brown patina. Localised patches of blue coloured surface corrosion are evident on one face, raising the possibility that the axe burnt immediately before being placed in the ground.



2. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - South Wales Type socketed axe (wedged into socket of axe 1)



Dimensions: maximum surviving length in the range of 53-57mm (not precisely ascertainable); surviving external width at mouth 31.3mm; combined weight (including socketed axe 1) 420.8g.



This is a mouth, upper face and side fragment of a broad socketed axe with a rectangular cross-section, which has been deliberately forced into the socket of axe 1 (above). The axe has a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding with a flat top. Two projecting runner stubs are evident on the mouth top surface, one located down the mid face section and the other down the mid side section (i.e. at 90 degrees to each other). Two, widely splayed ribs are evident on this partial face fragment, descending from the underside of the mouth and down the face of the axe. A prominent casting seam is evident down the non-loop side of this axe, indicating minimal finishing after casting. The axe fragment has a grey-green coloured patina.","The complete socketed axe (No. 1 above) may be identified as of Croxton Type, also known as a particular form of Class B - Southern English ribbed axes (Northover unpublished, 267; Needham 1990, 32-8). The Croxton type, with its diagnostic flaring trumpet mouth, deep collar band and ribs is so named after a defining example found in Cheshire, within a wider frequency observed along the Welsh Marches (Northover unpublished, 267). It is one form within a wider variety of Class B ribbed axes, found in hoards and as single finds across southern Britain. They are almost always found within hoards dating to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Croxton Type socketed axes have been found in increasing numbers of hoards across south east Wales in recent years, with examples in the Pendoylan, Llantwit Major, Wick, Tal-y-garn 1 and Colwinston (Vale of Glamorgan) hoards and an additional example from the St Arvans (Monmouthshire) hoard (Storrie 1887; Fox 1926; GGAT 1977-8; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, Cats. 280 & 281; 1984, 441b; Northover unpublished, H79 & H124; Gwilt 2004, Appendix 1, Cat. 10; Gwilt & Lodwick 2003; 2004; Lodwick & Gwilt 2007; Gwilt et al 2013a).



The fragmentary socketed axe (No. 2 above) wedged into the socket of the complete axe may be identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of pronounced out-splayed mouth, four-runner casting technology, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over thirty hoards now contain at least 140 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4;; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



The forcible ramming of artefact fragments into the sockets of axes is a widespread phenomenon in Britain during the Late Bronze Age. In south east Wales, the recently discovered Cowbridge, Tal-y-garn 2 and Colwinston, Vale of Glamorgan hoards, all of Ewart Park tradition, all show similar practice (Lodwick 2003; Lodwick & Gwilt 2003; Gwilt 2004, 122; Gwilt et al 2013a). It is likely that this represented a social practice involving the deliberate destruction or symbolic killing of objects, immediately before they were placed in the ground.",3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-12-18T00:00:00Z,,2013TW26,,,,,,,2,Adam Gwilt,Adam Gwilt,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llancarfan,ST0471,From a paper map,51.42984351,-3.38229101,NMGW-14B441,,DH007018_04.jpg,A Late Bronze Age hoard,National Museum Wales ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/DH007018_04.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/521653.jpg
727751,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1000,"An incomplete copper alloy palstave fragment of the Middle Bronze Age, dating c. BC 1600  to c.BC 1000.



Around 25% of the palstave is present, consisting of the butt of the axe. The fragment is broadly trapezoidal in plan with a broadly H shaped cross section. Both front and reverse faces are concave which denote the beginnings of the raised flanges, which taper out towards the break. No traces of decoration are visible. Both the front and reverse faces show signs of wear and there are areas of the patina missing. The break appears to be patinated suggesting object was broken in antiquity. 



The fragment measures 26.0 mm in length and is 24.7 mm wide (at the break) and 22.5 mm (at the butt end). It has a thickness of 7.8 mm (at the break) and 4.9 mm (at the butt end). It weighs 23.7 g. 



The fragment is a mid to dark green in colour, with the front face being dark green and the reverse is mid green, with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail, and damage to the remaining patina.



Due to the fragmentary nature of the object it is difficult to assign type. However the fragment does appear indicative of a Palstave axe rather than a developed axe.

The fragment is very abraided and consists of a triangular fragment with an eliptical cross section and represents part of a handle and blade of a sword. The object consists of two seperate pieces of metal, the blade and the handle fragment which surrounds it. When viewed from above the blade, 35mm long, has a narrow eliptical cross section which becomes narrower and thicker as it travels through the handle, until it has an oval cross section as viewed from below.

The blade is surrounded by the upper part of the handle. On both sides, the upper edge of the handle drops down and inwards from each end forming a semi-circular depression in its centre and creating sub-rectangular &#39;projections&#39; at each side. It also tapers in width, narrowing towards the present base, to accomodate the users hand. On each side of the handle, centrally placed in the projections are &#39;dummy&#39; rivets. These are positioned to correspond with those on the opposite side and one set are slightly deeper set than the others (The rough sketch attached shows the position of the &#39;dummy&#39; rivets).

Neil Wilkin has identified the fragment as &#39;belonging to a relatively small group of British swords with &#39;solid&#39; bronze hilts rather than organic ones (Burgess &amp; Colquhoun 1981, 122, no. 751-5), including a recent discovery from Cherry Burton, Yorkshire (YORYM-958D05).

The blade of the spear appears to be complete but it is unusually small at 37.4mm long and 24.6mm wide. The edge facets are about 3mm wide. The midrib continues to the very tip of the blade. It forms a pronounced rounded rib on each face. It can be described as conical, but is a little taller than it is wide.



There is 17mm between the base of the blade and the side loops. These are quite flat and have expanded pointed oval outer faces to the loops. The loops are 22.5mm long, 12mm wide and project 8mm from the shaft. Internally the loops are about 2mm wide and 7mm long. The casting seams are still visible between the loops and the blade but have been carefully trimmed. They are not visible between the loops and the mouth of the socket.



The mouth is circular and is 19.5mm external diameter. The walls are 2.8 - 3mm thick. The socket can be measured to at least 65.3mm deep. It tapers smoothly into the midrib.



The spear has a smooth tan brown patina with some slight pitting. Overall, it is 86mm long, 24.6mm wide, 18.8mm thick and is 57.81g.

732076,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Incomplete, copper alloy, side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of probably the Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1500 - c. BC 1150.


Most of the spear remains but the tip, side loops and the bottom half of the base are missing.


The spearhead is sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade, hollow socket and the remains of two cast side loops. The blade (sides and tip) of the spearhead is incomplete having been damaged in the ploughsoil. Therefore, accurate dimensions of the blade length and width cannot be given. The surviving blade measures 44.01 mm in length, and is 28.7 mm wide. Along the centre of the blade is a lozenge (oval) shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear. The socket is sub-oval in cross section and expands evenly along its length. The base of the socket has been damaged and broken, the internal diameter is approximately 12.2 mm. The internal length of the socket is 43.8 mm which suggests that it may extend a short distance into the midrib of the blade. The remains of the two loops are located on either side at the base of the socket, they remain as two oval shaped lugs one on top of the other, evenly spaced, on either side. These two loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. 

The spear measures 71.8 mm length, has a maximum width of 28.7 mm and maximum thickness of 14.5 mm. The blade has a thickness of 9.1 mm, and the wall of the socket is 2.7 mm thick. The spearhead weighs 41.7 grams. 

The spearhead is a dark-brown green colour. Originally it would have had a heavy polished patina that covered all surfaces. This patina has been badly abraded in many areas and there are several large pock marks on both the blade and the socket. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail and has resulted in the loss of part of the base and the tip of the object. 

Similar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (c. 1500 - 1150BC). Others have been recorded on the database, including HESH-218915.

733317,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1700,"A copper alloy Early Bronze Age flat axe probably dating from 1900 - 1700 BC. This fits into metalworking stage V-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3-4. The axe is decorated with rain pattern and bands of incised herringbone pattern.



The axe has a rounded butt which is about 30mm wide. The sides are straight for most of their length, then flare outwards to form a crescentic cutting edge with concave shoulders. The axe is thickest at the proto stop ridge (12.9mm thick) where the face of the butt and the face of the blade change in angle. This thickened area is decorated with a band of herringbone pattern incised across the axe. The band of decoration is 5.1mm wide and is divided into two rows of oblique lines, each row sloping in a different direction.



The cuttin edge is damaged, chipped and corroded with pitting and concretion adhering. It is 99mm wide but the tips are missing. The breaks are patinated. The first visible decoation is 16mm from the cutting edge. It is a group of at least three lines which follow the line of the cutting edge. Inside them is a band 7mm wide which is decorated with widely spaced lines forming triangles. Only one and a half are visible. Behind this band is a 9mm wide panel of herringbone pattern. The area is divided into three zones with incised lines following the line of the cuttin edge. The spaces are filled with punched oblique lines.



The sides of the face have a border of two engraved parallel lines, 2mm apart, following the line of the edge of the axe. This runs from the inside edge of the triple herringbone band, is unterrupted by the herringbone at the stop ridge, and contines to at least 50mm from the butt. Wherever the original surface survives on the butt and the blade, there is rain pattern; wide, shallow depressions, from 3 - 10mm long and about 0.5 - 0.7mm wide, orientated along the length of the axe.



The other face of the axe appears to be decorated in the same way, but has less detail surviving. It is uncertain whether some transverse lines across the middle of the butt are decoration or later damage. More rain pattern is visible.



The sides of the axe are thickened, but are not developed into flanges. They do not appear to be decorated, but little original surface survives and they are pitted.



The axe is similar to Willerby metalwork illustrated on page 125 of Rohn and Needham (1998), especially number 58. Compare also CORN-C53643 and SF-9072A6. The axe is 205mm long, 99mm wide and 12.9mm thick. 604g. It has a smooth dark grey green patina surviving in places, but much of the axe is pitted and corroded and is a bright green to white colour, especially at the ends.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-03-10T00:00:00Z,2015-03-20T00:00:00Z,,,604,,,12.9,205,1,Amy Downes,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,Bradford,Bradford,Steeton with Eastburn,SE0243,From finder,53.88318741,-1.9710595,SWYOR-F748BE,,PAS_2565_axe.jpg,Bronze Age flat axe,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/PAS_2565_axe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/525752.jpg

The object is composed of a single cast piece with a slight central ridge. The shaft is rectangular with a single, central, circular perforation at its upper end. A minor amount of the shaft is missing due to an old break. The blade is wider below the shaft to form angular shoulders which then taper to a point at its lower end.



The metal is a dark green with lighter green patches and has a pitted and corroded patina.

733726,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An almost complete copper alloy basal-looped socketed spearhead (Davis Group 9) of the Middle Bronze Age period, dating 1500 - 1150 BC.



The object has been broken into two pieces on lifting due to an old break just below the blade.



The spearhead is broadly oval in plan and triangular in profile. It has a leaf or flame shaped blade. The tip of the spear is complete and the left side of the blade is complete with the cutting edge in tact, the right side of the blade is mostly complete aside from a irregular shaped piece missing from two thirds of the way down the blade. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) oval shaped midrib which expands into the socket of the spear. The socket is best described as being conical in shape. The spearhead is broken at a point above the socket, the break is jagged and the edges are abraded and patinated suggesting that the break is an old one, however the pieces detached on lifting when found. The socket is conical and tapers evenly inside the mid rib. At the base of the blade are two broadly rectangular shaped loops each with a rectangular perforation, when the two pieces of the object are together the loops are complete, they have been broken but no part is missing. The loops would have originally been used to help attach and secure the spearhead to the wooden shaft, a part of which remains inside both pieces of the socket. They also may have been used as suspension loops for some form of tassel or decoration.



The object has a maximum length of 165 mm, a maximum width of 40.0 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 24.5 mm and a maximum weight of 97 g.



Piece 1 (Blade) - has a length of 97.2 mm and a maximum width of 40.0 mm at the base of the blade, the tip is 6.0 mm wide. It has a maximum thickness of 15.9 mm at the base and 4.2 mm at the tip. It weighs 43.7 g



Piece 2 (Socket) - has a length of 77.3 mm and a width of 23.6 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 24.5 mm at the base and 18.0 mm at the top. It weighs 54.0 g

The spear is a mid brown in colour with an uneven patina, there is evidence of areas of corrosion, as well as evidence, on the left side of the blade, of the original gold coloured patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



Similar basal-looped spearheads have been classified by Richard Davis (2006) and dated to the Middle Bronze Age. Davis has sub-classified these into classes / Types. This example corresponds best with his Type 6. Davis dates his Type 6 to the later Acton Park phase (1500-1300 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age the Taunton phase (1400 - 1200BC) and the early Penard phase (1250-1150BC) These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup.Other similar examples have also been recorded on the database, including HESH-BA2F61and HESH-821195.

734550,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"Middle Bronze Age copper-alloy Group III palstave (1500-1300 BC): A copper alloy palstave with very feint single mid rib and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On both faces of the blade there is a feint single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The surface of the blade has only small patches of a dark brown patina, mainly within the hollows, otherwise the surface is pitted. The cutting edge is rounded due to abrasion, but appears to be slightly asymmetrical. The blade facet is 11.62mm wide. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam. There is a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. Before the stop ridge, on both faces, there is a small shield-shaped/pattern decoration. The flange sides are a sub triangle in profile with casting seams, and are incomplete. One side, at the junction of the blade and stop there is an incomplete, integral loop which has a sub-lozenge section. The void is a sub semi-circle. In plan the septrum tapers slightly towards the butt, whose butt is rectangular with rounded corners. On one face of the butt terminal there are two large air holes visible. The palstave measures 159.16mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 59.90mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 29.16mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 398g.



The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group III type which has a mid rib decoration. Dot Broughton comments that 'shield-pattern below the stop ridge is small compared to others'. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC.



Peter Reavill comments that the palstave '...fits within Acton Park II or Taunton metalworking assemblage.' Therefore this can be classified further as fitting within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII. Similar axes are illustrated in Savoury (1980), Figure 22, Nos. 162 and 164.

735137,Pin,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"A Middle Bronze Age pin with a disc-shaped head, decorated shaft and perforated swelling on the shaft. The pin is a derivative of a Picardy-type pin and dates to c1400-1250BC. The pin is now bent but is complete and, if straight, measures 180mm. The surfaces are now mainly dark brown and there are iron-rich surface deposits, especially underneath the head of the pin. The disc-shaped head is 23.70mm in diameter and has a prominent rim on its upper face. The face of the disc is left rough and gives the impression there was an inlay made from a different material. Less than midway along the shaft is a prominent projection in the form of an elongated diamond which is pierced by a transverse hole now filled with corrosion products. Surface damage to the projection reveals a bright yellow metal.



Between this projection and the sloping base of the head the shaft is extensively decorated. The decoration comprises three, or more probably four, bands of (4 or 5) encircling grooves. Between each group of encircling grooves the shaft is covered with bands of alternating diagonal hatching.



Picardy type pins are dated from the early Taunton phase of the Bronze Age and according to the most recent interpretations probably go out of use by the Renard phase, giving a date range of between c.1400 and 1250 BC (Roberts, 2007: 141).

Two joining fragments form a parallel sided strip, or ribbon. The whole is heavily disfigured by buckling and denting, including a sharp bend at the break Both ends are neatly squared suggesting that the complete object is present. One of the terminals is emphasised by a slight external beading. Prior to damage, the back would have been flat, while the front carries twenty-four very finely incised grooves aligned longitudinally.





Extant lengths 60.5 & 41.5 mm Length stretched out  c.117 mm width c. 17.5 mm thickness c. 0.5 mm weights  6.1 & 3.6 g","Identification



This object cannot be identified with total certainty, but similar multi-grooved ribbon ornaments of Bronze Age date and varied in size are known from north-west Europe; this provides the most likely cultural background. The length of the ribbon, if complete, is too short for other than a child‚Äôs bracelet. Another ornamental function is more likely.





Narrow-ribbon ornaments from the Saint-Marc-le-Blanc hoard, Brittany, have fewer and correspondingly broader ribs/grooves. They are finer on an earring from Saint-P√®re-en-Retz (Loire-Atlantique) and finer still on some Irish Bronze Age ornaments. Among the latter are examples in two important associations, from Saintjohns, Co Kildare, and Derrinboy, Co Offaly. The Derrinboy pieces have enhanced ribs along the long edges not present on the Flixton object, but they are of similar length. Good parallels are harder to find in Britain, but there is a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, excavated from a layer which also yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age. Three gold grooved strips from Scottish grave finds which served as pommel mounts for Early Bronze Age daggers are crafted differently and may be less relevant.





Conclusion



This object is predominantly of precious metal, is almost certainly over 300 years old and potentially of archaeological interest both locally and for broader stylistic studies.

738854,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"An incomplete copper alloy Late Bronze Age (c.1150-c.600 BC) pegged, socketed spearhead, missing the rim of its socket. Overall, the spearhead measures 50.7mm long, 24.5mm wide and 19.9mm thick. It weighs 24.20g.



The spearhead is small (stumpy). It has a short kite-shaped blade measuring 37.3mm long. The edges of the blade expand to a maximum of 5.1mm away from the midrib. The midrib extends to the tip of the blade. The midrib contains the socket for the spear's shaft, which is conical and expands rapidly towards the socket opening. The socket measures 35mm in depth and the opening has an external diameter of 22.9mm and an internal diameter 19.5mm. No organic material survives in the socket.



Below the blade there are four circular perforations through the rim of the socket, one on each side. Three of these are incomplete due to the broken rim of the socket. These perforations would have held pegs for holding the spearhead on the shaft. Normally pegged spearheads have only one or two holes which are aligned below the blade edges. The two holes aligned with the blade edges are both incomplete and have damaged edges coverd with pale corrosion product. The other two have much neater edges - the complete hole is a almost a perfect circle - with the same patination as the rest of the object. Drilled holes on similar spearheads tend to be quite rough so the neater holes may have been cast rather than drilled. 



An example of a similar pegged spearhead on the database is LVPL-D726F2.



Richard Davis says: These types of spearhead are normally found in hoards and are normally found in the Southeast. Besides the other example on the database, 58 spearheads of this type have been found in Britain. Five were found in hoard in Pembrokeshire, but most have been found in East Anglia around the edge of the Fenn or in the upper Thames Valley. Also 22 of them were found in the Blackmoor Hoard in Hampshire. This find suggests that there were links between the Trent Valley and the Southeast and that there was influence in Nottinghamshire area from the Southeast.

739808,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"A late Middle to early Late Bronze Age (1400 - 1100 BC) copper alloy notched-butt type rapier has been deliberately broken in two prior to deposition.  The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade.  A single incomplete rivet hole/notch to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, one of the notches still retains its rivet; the rivet is 15mm long with a 7mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The centre of the butt has a low central rib on both sides that extends up to the base of the blade. The blade is straight and only tapers to a point in the last 25mm of its length; the overall length of the blade alone is approximately 166mm long, 20mm wide and 3.8mm thick.  The end of the blade has been snapped off, the angle of the break shows that the final 65mm of the blade was bent back on itself to about a 140 degree angle before the metal gave way and snapped. This is not post-depositional damage but a premeditated act prior to loss/burial.



The overall length including broken tip is 234mm

740817,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,42,"A cast copper-alloy unidentified object of a known type usually referred to as 'moustache-like' or 'moustache shaped'. These objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117) and various other finds reported to the PAS which are associated with Middle Bronze Age material. The object is a hollow three-dimensional pointed oval with a bulbous upper portion. It is decorated with a series of shallow longitudinal grooves which run down the exterior of the bulbous or bowl-shaped part of the item, apart from a small area on the base, which come to a halt about half way along the length of the item leaving the pointed terminus plain and undecorated. The majority of the bulbous part is hollow as can be seen from the opening at the wider end, which is roughly sub-oval at its deepest point. At the point where the two symmetrical bars join, there is a plain band of roughly 4.1 mm in width. The distance between the two lower pointed terminal-ends is approximately 14.9 mm wide, indicating that the aperture ranges from 5.7 mm wide to 12.5 mm long. The entire object measures 20.59 mm long, 18.06 mm wide, 9.56 mm thick and weighs 9.48 grams.



Other hollow examples include: SUSS-3AEC48, WILT-0C9A63, BH-A7CCB5 and BERK-403617. Unlike PAS recorded objects WILT-0C9A63 and NMS-0F4645 this example does not have two rivet holes, one each side of the opening. These holes are not seen on complete examples, such as this one, and may suggest repairs or a variation in design. The complete form gives the items the appearance of being shaped like a stylised moustache or pair of wings. The purpose of these items is unknown but chape is the usual suggestion.","
Although their function is uncertain, multiple hypotheses have been suggested, including decorative mount, dagger or scabbard chape. Dr JD Hill at the British Museum suggests that they are Iron Age rather than Bronze Age, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example (Oxford Archaeology recovered a stratified example from Clay Farm, Trumpington; however it has yet to be published.

741085,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"
Cast late Bronze Age copper alloy miniature socketed axe. The object is covered in a pale yellowish green patina with patches of dark grey probably representing the dark silts in which it was found. There are very occasional small patches of bright copper metal showing. In profile, the sides of the axe are parallel flaring out abruptly to form a crescent shaped blade at one end and expanding slightly at the socketed end to produce a 'collar' around the mouth of the socket. Viewed on edge, the axe is a distinctly triangular shape with a prominent oval attachment loop projecting from one edge. Both edges show remnants of significant casting seams which are very rounded perhaps through wear or possibly through rough finishing during the manufacturing process. The blade is asymmetrical with one point of the blade noticeably longer than the other, possibly the result of sharpening over time.  The socket is a rounded rectangular shape narrowing to a lozenge shape towards the blade.  



Discussion:



The small size of the axe may indicate that it was intended for a more specialised activity such as carpentry rather than simply forest clearance. (Frances Lynch pers. comm.)

741155,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Late Bronze Age cast copper-alloy socketed hammer, (1000-800BC). The hammer is almost complete with some wear on the mouth and base. The hammer body face is almost rectangular, tapering slightly towards the mouth end. There is a lower moulding line and flared collar to the mouth. From a side view the tapering cannot be seen, and the base is rounded. The vertical corners on the hammer body are chamfered, resulting in an octagonal cross-section. The mouth is ovate in shape 27.75mm by 23.51mm. Casting seams can be seen on both sides, evidence of two piece moulding. The hammer surface is smooth with a dark brown patina, where this surface has been lost the metal is rough and a light green.



The earliest bronze hammers were created in the Middle Bronze Age Taunton metalwork phase, however hammer finds are more defined in Late Bronze Age hoard discoveries. Socketed hammers became more widespread in the Penard phase (c1200-950BC), and according to Burgess this tradition lasted longer in the North of Britain whereas the characteristics of the Wilburton Phase were prominent in southern Britain during the tenth century BC. Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart-Park Phase which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800BC. Burgess (1968) describes two socketed hammers from the Kilnhurst hoard in Yorkshire, one long and the other short which is similar to the example here. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding. The example described here is more likely a later example in the Penard Phase. Burgess also parallels Penard metalwork to continental examples and in particular western France.



In comparison to socketed axes, socketed hammers are a rare find, and to date only 35 recorded and publically accessible on the PAS database, 3 of which were found in North Yorkshire. Similar hammers to this example have been recorded as FAKL-9C9543, LVPL-5A7954 and SWYOR-D13642. The Kilnhurst hammers can be seen in Burgess (1938, Fig. 13, p.18).



This hammer is 54.58mm in length, 24.25mm wide, 20.57mm thick and weighs 77g.

Peter Reavill comments:



This is a Piggott (1946) Class I double-edged razor - some of these are decorated along the mid rib and many are pierced through the tang. The date is later EBA - early MBA and they are often associated with burials. This example is similar to Piggott's cat. no.34 which is from Winterslow, Wilts (and associated with cinerary urn and amber buttons / hair ornaments - now in Ashmoleon Museum). I would expect it to date in the region of c1800 BC - c1400 BC.","

741449,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-800,-700,"Cast copper alloy blade from a socketed axehead that is square in plan, triangular in profile and lozenge-shaped in section. The blade is narrow with straight sides with no suggestion of flanging and the cutting edge is rounded and blunt, though severely affected by corrosive pitting. The broken end of the blade still has the end of the socket which would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket is 21 mm long, 3 mm wide and 3 mm deep. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has partly corroded away and there are patches of light green bronze disease at the broken end. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, also refered to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but sparse. They date from the end of the Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase, and into Hallstatt C (c.800-700 BC).

1. Carp's Tongue sword blade fragment



Surviving length 41.0mm; surviving width 27.7mm; maximum thickness 9.5mm; surviving weight 35.2g.



Small blade fragment with a rounded midrib, approximately 11.8mm wide, with edge defined by single grooves to either side and on both faces. The outer sections of the blade are highly corroded, with no original blade edge surviving. The blade fragment is bent towards one end, as viewed side on, indicating it was forcibly broken in antiquity. The fragment has a green patination, with areas of ligher green corrosion along breaks. Cracking is visible on both sides, parallel with the midrib and near the corroded edges.



2. Carp's Tongue sword blade fragment



Surviving length 27.7mm; surviving width 28.6mm; maximum thickness 7.2mm; surviving weight 19.6g.



Small blade fragment with a rounded midrib, approximately 11.0mm wide, with edge defined by single grooves on either side of both faces. On one side of the blade, short sections of original blade edge are present, the outer blade section being slightly convex. On each outer blade section, a second, less pronounced groove also parallel with the blade edge is evident, approximately 4.2mm from the midrib edge grooves and 5.0mm from the blade edge (the total outer blade section being approximately 9.2mm wide). The surviving blade edge looks to have been deliberately damaged by a blade in antiquity, as evidenced by nicks and localised distortion of the blade edge. On one face, just below a break, there are impact dints on the midrib, causing localised flattening of the blade and an undulating surface. These are small and non-linear, suggesting the use of a pointed metal implement. This is further evidence of deliberate breakage of the blade in antiquity. The fragment has a green patination, with areas of lighter green corrosion along the least well preserved blade edge, in localised patches at blade breaks and in the blade edge nicks on the better preserved blade edge. Corrosion cracking is visible on the surface of the less well preserved outer blade side.



3. Purse- or bag-shaped chape fragment



Surviving width 47.1mm; surviving height 27.8mm; surviving weight 21.3g.



Base and body fragment of a chape with a curved convex base, defined by a convex ridge or bead on each face, and hollow interior. The walls of this chape thicken towards the base. On one side, a change in angle of the wall is visible, indicating a narrowing inwards towards the original mouth of the chape, now missing, thereby giving its characteristic 'purse' or 'bag' shape. At the break on the best preserved face, the partial circuit of a perforation, 2-2.5mm in diameter, is evident. This is offset from the centre line of the chape and was a point of attachment of the chape to the rest of the scabbard. No further perforations may be identified in the walls of this fragmentary chape. On one face, near the narrowing side wall, a surface dent can be seen. This was appears to have been made in antiquity and is possibly evidence of use wear or deliberate damage prior to burial. The artefact has a green patination with localised areas of light green corrosion on one face and along the line of breaks.



4. Multiple-edged perforated blade



Length 77.1mm; surviving width 42.7mm; maximum thickness at centre 8.0mm; surviving weight 88.0g.



A near complete, elongate hexagon shaped blade. The blade has a thickened elongate ridge along its longitudinal axis, tapering off on all sides, to form blade bevels and sharpened edges on all six sides. The blade has a rectangular shaped perforation at the centre and parallel with the long axis. The top of the aperture on each face is significantly larger than the actual perforation through the object. The apertures on each face, although overlapping, are also offset in relation to each other (on the long axis) and different in size. On each face, looking into the aperture, both an area of perforation and an area obscured by bronze from the centre to the lower face is evident. At one narrow end, a fragment of the blade bevel and edge has been broken off. The blade has a green patina. Original blade edges survive on one long side and one of the shorter end faces, the others being damaged and corroded with swelling light green corrosion product.



5. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 42.5mm; maximum surviving width 33.9mm; maximum thickness 20.8mm; surviving weight 122.1g.



Irregular upper surface and irregular convex shaped base. No edge sections apparent, although ingot fragment tapers on one side, where approaching an edge. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to blue-green patina.



6. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 73.5mm; maximum surviving width 57.1mm; maximum thickness 30.7mm; surviving weight 367.6g.



Irregular upper surface and irregular convex base. Breaks on two faces and tapering in two planes indicates this is a corner fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Large interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.



7. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 63.7mm; maximum surviving width 48.7mm; maximum thickness 34.6mm; surviving weight 462.4g.



Irregular upper surface and slightly convex shaped base. Breaks on all four sides indicate a middle fragment of an ingot although tapering in two planes indicate the fragment was approaching two sides of the ingot. Large interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.



8. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 56.0mm; maximum surviving width 49.8mm; maximum thickness 27.0mm; surviving weight 299.0g.



Irregular upper surface and slightly convex shaped base. Breaks on three sides and tapering in one plane indicate that this is a side fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Interior vesicles evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Green to grey-green patina.



9. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 75.0mm; maximum surviving width 63.8mm; maximum thickness 31.0mm; surviving weight 577.9g.



Irregular upper surface with vesicles and irregular convex shaped base. Three breaks and tapering in three planes suggest this is an incomplete end fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Interior vesicles are evident along breaks. Breaks are worn and were made in antiquity. Light grey-green to grey-green patina.



10. Plano-convex ingot / cake fragment



Maximum surviving length 87.0mm; maximum surviving width 60.3mm; maximum thickness 36.2mm; surviving weight 618.5g.



Irregular upper surface with vesicles and irregular convex shaped base with vesicles. Three major breaks and tapering in one plane indicate this is a side fragment of a plano-convex ingot. There is a small break along the edge, although short sections of original ingot edge are present. Breaks and vesicle edges have some angularity however lack of freshly exposed surfaces suggest breakage in antiquity. Light grey-green patina.","The classes and types of artefacts identified within this dispersed artefact scatter find close parallel within Late Bronze Age hoards elsewhere, with the combination of associated types indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating certainly to between 1000-800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997) and probably between 900-800 BC (Brandherm & Moskal-del Hoyo 2014, 33). This is consistent with their once having been buried at the same time and in direct association with each other in the ground, probably in a small purpose made shallow pit feature. It is probable that the original hoard burial place was disturbed though recent agricultural ploughing or boundary wall modification activity nearby. The scatter pattern, over a maximum distance of 22.5 metres, is entirely consistent with these likely scenarios, dispersal of objects being commonly observed during the recovery of hoards. It is possible that further artefacts from the hoard may be found in the immediate locality at future date and these would also be considered as potential treasure, in association with these earlier finds.



The two sword blade fragments in this hoard (nos. 1 & 2 above) may be identified as of Carp's Tongue form on the basis of their rounded midribs defined by single grooves following the outline of the blade (Colquhoun & Burgess 1988, 108; Needham 1990, 52). The chape fragment (no. 3 above), of diminutive size, with a convex base defined by a bead, sides narrowing towards the mouth and a perforation for attachment to the rest of the scabbard, may be identified as one of a class of bag-shaped or purse-shaped chapes, also termed Class 3 chapes (Eogan 1965, 169-74, Fig. 92 Nos. 11-14; Burgess 1968, 22-3, 38-39; Figs 13-14 & Appendix V; O'Connor 1980, 190-1). The multiple-edged and perforated blade (no. 4 above) can be identified as a knife, with variant forms termed racloirs and hog's-back knives (O'Connor 1980, 179). Racloirs are triangular in shape with three blade edges and a central perforation, while hog's back knives are sub-rectangular, have a single blade edge and a perforation set at the top margin opposing the blade edge. While preliminary research has not yielded close parallels for the Marloes & St Brides example, with its elongate hexagon shape, central perforation and four blade edges, nevertheless the combination of similar features and form permit confident identification as a knife allied with these known classes of knives.



Plano-convex ingot fragments (nos. 5-10 above) become common components of hoards towards the end of the Late Bronze Age. Over 40 Carp's Tongue hoards of Ewart Park date, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex copper alloy ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). Similarly, the St Ishmael, Carmarthenshire hoard contained a single plano-convex ingot fragment amongst a hoard of fifteen artefacts (Gwilt et al, unpublished treasure report).",3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,2013-01-09T00:00:00Z,,2013T01,,,,,,,10,Adam Gwilt,Wenke Domscheit,,Pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,Marloes and St. Brides,SM7709,From a paper map,51.73523117,-5.23102237,NMGW-1564D4,,DH007014_08.jpg,"Late Bronze Age Hoard from Marloes & St Brides, Pembrokeshire",National Museum Wales ,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wenkedomscheit/DH007014_08.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/533697.jpg

The break is ancient and irregular with bubbles form the casting visible in the cross-section. The blade has a very low curved forward edge which is heavily corroded. Behind the blade the surface of the axe is in excellent condition with a dark green patina that has a series of shallow striation that run up from the blade on the top and bottom edge that are probably formed from use or sharpening. The casting seam is visible but has been filed down. The body is decorated with three horizontal ribs on both sides. The socket at the rear is oval 37mm, long by 9mm wide and 4mm deep.



Length 40mm, width 49mm, thickness 18mm, weight 101g



2, fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe that consists of the blade and a small portion of the socket. The blades has a short curved working edge. The socket sits very close behind the blade and results in there only being 5mm of metal between the tip of the blade and the end of the socket. Although the remaining portion of the axe is heavily truncated the remaining section suggests it would have been a very narrow implement.

5, Broken Late Bronze Age socketed axe that is 80% complete. This fragment is missing the lower half of the socket on one side. The blade has a low curved forward edge the tip of which is heavily corroded and suffering from bright green bronze disease. The sides of the blade curve inwards to the walls of the axe where a casting seam is visible, but which has been filed down. The body is decorated with three horizontal ribs on both sides which terminate just before the socket. The socket would originally have been rectangular, but approximately half of its length is now missing, the remaining portion has a semi-circular collar which is now heavily corroded. On one side of the axe is a projecting knop, this is the forward section of the truncated loop, the rear of the loop would have been on the missing element of the axe.



Length 57mm, width 33mm, thickness 26mm, weight 50.46mm,



Chronology: Socketed axes deposited in fragmentary, 'scrap' hoards are most common during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age c. 950-800 BC BC (Needham 1996).



Discussion: The axe fragments are too fragmentary to be assigned to a typological grouping. They are, however, of a comparable date and the addition of a fragment of casting waste is consistent with a so-called 'scrap' or 'founders' hoards of the Late Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2015-08-04T23:00:00Z,2015-08-04T23:00:00Z,2015T663,,,,,,,4,Kurt Adams,Kurt Adams,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Orcop,SO4525,Generated from computer mapping software,51.92079244,-2.80113846,GLO-2AFBCD,,GLO2AFBCDFragment4.JPG,GLO-2AFBCD Bronze Age casting waste fragmemnt,Bristol City Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/kadams/GLO2AFBCDFragment4.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/533852.jpg

743164,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date ( about 1000 - 800 BC). The object can be classified as fitting into the Ewart Park phase of metalwork. The object has been broken and just the tip, including the deepest part of the socket survives.



The object is sub-rectangular in plan with the cutting edge flaring outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is almost complete but is very abraded. It measures 41mm in width, and is 1.4mm thick. At the incomplete socket end the object measures 34.8mm in width and is 12.1mm thick. The remaining socket is 2.5mm deep. The edges of the socket are broken irregularly.



Patches of a glossy dark brown patina remain on each face however the majority of the surface is pitted and abraded due to movement within the plough soil. Some small patches of light green corrosion are present.



Socketed axes are most common during the Ewart park phase of metal work which corresponds with metalworking phases X - XII, or Needham Periods 6-7, dating from about 1150-750 CAL BC. This would date the axe from about 1000 - 800 BC. However socketed axes were also known during the Wilburton phase of metalwork and due to the incompleteness of this example an earlier date cannot be ruled out.

743264,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1100,"Possible Bronze Age (c.1600 to 1100 BC) chisel: This incomplete copper-alloy object may be a probable chisel or possibly a palstave. Only the blade end of the object survives, and the cutting edge is 32.17mm wide and the sides then taper to 29.27mm wide at the break, where it is 12.46mm thick and a rounded sub-lozenge in cross-section. No evidence of the side flanges or stop ridge survive making the object hard to classify and date confidently. The faces of the artefact has a trace of a swollen rib. The surface of the artefact has traces of a dark green patina and is otherwise abraded. The patina is not heavy and there is no pitting on the surface. The patina also covers the break. The tool is 33.86mm long, 32.08mm wide and 12.25mm thick. 47.86g.



The artefact is very similar to SWYOR-2DED2C on this database. The narrowness of the blade and thickness at the break are perhaps more similar to chisels such as NMS-894E92, SF2649 and SOMDOR-7B3C43 on this database, but it have the horizontal sides of the more common chisel form, as seen on SF-09D1D5 and SUSS-D93644 on this database. However, small, narrow-bladed palstaves belonging to the Taunton phase (1400-1300 BC) of metalworking or possibly to the slightly earlier Acton Park II period, (c.1500-1400 BC); (both corresponding with Needham's period 5, 1500 - 1150 CAL BC) are also similar, especially in the rapid thickening from blade to break. It was perhaps similar to SOM-1DE687, HAMP-996311. Further arguments on either side are given in SOM-2B70A5, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1600 - 1100 BC.



The patina is not typical of Bronze Age artefacts, and therefore there is a possibility that the item is of a later date.

744139,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Description: 



(I am grateful to John Llywelyn Williams for the following description & discussion)



The find comprises two fragments of a copper alloy flat axe.



The larger blade fragment was initially thought to be all that survived. This fragment represents the lower half of the axe which has been severed from the butt end at a slight angle. The surface is of a generally uniform mid-brown colour with significant patches of green mottling signifying active corrosion. The fragment is slightly asymmetric in plan with one side gently concave and the other side continuing in a straighter line to the blade termination. The blade forms a shallow crescent with an abraded, irregular cutting edge, possibly from use in antiquity but accentuated by decay. Both points of the blade are missing and may have suffered from more recent damage. The surviving width of the blade is 85.4mm. The axe faces are both flat, producing a rounded rectangular body in section with a width at the break of 38.9mm and a maximum thickness of 16.3mm. One face of the axe fragment is pitted whilst the reverse face is smooth and exceptionally well preserved and may show evidence of the grinding and polishing undertaken to produce the completed object.



The second fragment was found several days after the discovery of the main blade fragment and was found some 4m away. It is a mid-green colour with dark grey surface mottling possibly representing soil staining. The two faces are fairly smooth but with noticeable scattered pitting. It is nearly rectangular in plan though the edges do converge slightly towards one end. The wide end is 38.91mm wide and the narrow is 29.62mm wide. The edges are rounded and again quite pitted, and they thin rapidly towards the narrower end of the fragment. The narrow end is quite thin (3.76mm) and is curled over at its extreme tip probably due to damage. The wide end is a broken edge and is very irregular. On one face the edge is fairly straight but on the other face it intrudes into the fragment body suggesting a significant wedge of metal is now missing. The corrosion on the break surface is quite powdery suggesting recent active decay.



Discussion:



The axe fragments probably belong to a single 'Migdale' type axe. The close correspondence of the measurements of width and thickness at the break, and the fairly regular, contiguous shape in plan formed by the two fragments would seem to support this.



Early Bronze Age flat axes of type 'Migdale' (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44)1 belong to 'Metalworking Assemblage III', corresponding to Needham's (1996)2 Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC (though the typology of axes is currently under review). The Coed Bolyn axe is the first Migdale example from Gwynedd, if not from the whole of the area north of the Dee - Wynion river divide with the exception of the two Anglesey axes from Talwrn and the unprovenanced example possibly from  Llangaffo.



The most significant feature of the axe is its large size. The average length of the 24 complete Migdale type axes from Wales is 14.2cm with a blade width of 8.1cm (21 axes). In the Welsh corpus the only axe of comparable size is the complete example in the Oxwich hoard from the Gower peninsula (Swansea) with a length of 18cm, and a blade width of 13.3cm.



A second significant feature is the break that has divided the axe approximately in half. On the blade fragment, the break is clean and straight although it has produced a weak discontinuous peripheral lip on one side with a small projecting tail at the terminal end. This would suggest that the object has been bent, and snapped under pressure to leave the slight accretion on the lower side.



This 'clean' sharp break may also indicate deliberate breakage. Clean breaks of this type have been reproduced under experimental conditions. A bronze axe placed in a bonfire and heated to approximately 900¬∫C may be snapped if beaten while red hot over a projecting ledge to produce the slight underside lipping described above (David Chapman, Ancient Arts Ltd. pers. comm.).



Axes may be broken up in antiquity as part of a recycling programme. However this axe does not appear to have been crudely smashed.There is growing evidence that axes and axe fragments were buried in significant and deliberately chosen locations near to water courses, springs, bogs or in areas associated with other prehistoric activity.



However the break on the butt fragment of this axe is of a completely different character. The edge on one face is fairly straight and regular but the edge on the other face has a large wedge of material missing; torn or broken away. The regular edge is a fair match for the break on the main blade fragment, but the other edge does not match at all and there is no matching lip. This suggests that either the original breakage was not as clean and precise as at first thought, or that the butt fragment has been subjected to later secondary damage. As the two fragments were found approximately 4m apart, it is likely that they have been disturbed at some time, possibly by ploughing, and it may be that the butt break was further modified at this point.

744857,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A cast copper alloy socketed side-looped spearhead found in two pieces, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1550 BC - 1250 BC. The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with a sub-oval / leaf-shaped blade, hollow socket and cast side loops; Davis Group 6, 'developed side looped'.The spear head has broken, fairy recently, across the lower part of the blade. The two pieces were found about 6 metres apart. The tip piece is 57.2mm long, 19.9mm wide and 9.6mm thick. The socket piece is 74.2mm long, 23.1mm wide and 17.7mm thick.



The blade measures about 75mm in length, 23.1mm in width and the tip of the blade is 2.6mm thick. The overall shape of the blade can be described as being leaf-shaped. It has straight sides at the point end, with a rounded base near the socket. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear.



The base of the socket is 17.7mm in diameter. The internal socked measures 63.9mm deep. The two loops are positioned 14.5mm below the base of the blade. The loops measure 14mm in length and are 4.1mm wide. The loops are fairly flat in cross-section.



The object has a smooth dark brown to olive green patina which is pitted in places. Some of the blade edge is damaged. The break between the two pieces is less patinated than the rest of the object, but it is not an immediately recent break.



LVPL-893C73 is a similar example (among others on the PAS database) and the record notes that ""Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, dating from about 1500-1150BC."" Davis (2017), however, suggests that 'spearheads from the earlier MBA [Middle Bronze Age] were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket'. He dates these 'to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC', consequently this example has been dated similarly.

745015,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete copper-alloy rapier, dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age.



The flat-sectioned butt is sub-trapezoidal in plan, the thickness gradually declining towards a scallop-shaped upper end. Two C-shaped notches, located below this upper portion, mark the points at which the now-missing handle plates would have been attached. The widest point is at the shoulders, beneath which the concave sides angle inwards, smoothly extending into the parallel-sided blade. This blade is of lozenge-shaped cross section and has been broken in antiquity. The piece has a mid to dark brown surface patina (slightly pitted in places) which suggests deposition within a damp environment.



Length: 81.8mm; width: 31.7mm; thickness: 4.4mm. Weight: 34.01g.



This rapier forms part of a dispersed group of Middle to Late Bronze Age metalwork found to the north of Faringdon and concentrated on the northern side of the River Thames. Close parallels include a complete (albeit broken) rapier (GLO-036A39) and pieces of two further such implements (SUR-A18104/Treasure case 2015 T331). All of these rapiers are of similar form, being of Burgess and Gerloff's Group IV (1981) and dating to the period c. 1500-c. 1150 BC.

745226,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-650,"An incomplete copper alloy socketed gouge of late Bronze Age date. The remaining portion is a length of the hollow socket with a tapered U-shaped blade terminal to one end. The opposite end terminates in a worn break.



The socket is circular with an exterior diameter of 15.6mm, interior diameter of 12.1mm and is 20.7mm deep. From the socket the blade tapers to a rounded cutting/gouging edge which is concave to one side of the body. The gouging edge is extremely worn.



Peter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer for Herefordshire & Shropshire, states that this gouge is of Wilberton, Ewart Park or Llyn Fawr metalworking, phases which correspond to Needham's (1996) Period's 6 - 8.



The metal has a dark greenish-brown patina and is worn. The gouge is 49.6mm long, 15.6mm in diameter at the socket, 13.4mm x 7.1mm at the cutting edge and the walls are 1.9mm thick. The object weighs 23.5g.



Comparable socketed gouges have been recorded on the PAS database. For examples see: SWYOR-FCB525, NMGW-62C84F, DUR-06F0E8, IOW-EC25A7 and SUR-7898C5. The latter record notes that: ""Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. It is difficult to suggest a date for this example with a prominent single, slender moulding. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC. Needham et al's (1997) recent study of Bronze Age chronology dated a collared socketed gouge from the Bodwrog Hoard, Anglesey to 2720 +- 45 BP (DoB No 3, OxA-4652, p68).""",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,23.5,,15.5,1.9,49.6,1,Rebecca Griffiths,Rebecca Griffiths,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Ryedale,Cawton,SE6476,GPS (from the finder),54.17580544,-1.02101455,YORYM-CD7FFB,,BL1294.jpg,Bronze Age : Gouge,York Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/BL1294.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/537257.jpg
745700,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Cast copper alloy MIddle Bronze Age early short-flanged axehead, developing from a flat axe to a palstave with low side flanges and only a slight stop ridge. The side flanges are leaf-shaped in profile and damaged but their highest point is in line with the slight stop ridge which runs across the width of the axehead above the 'septum' or recessed area between the flanges. This ridge would have stopped the wooden haft from shifting on to the septum and the side flanges would have stopped any sideways movement and would help to bind the haft to the axehead. The undecorated septum is slightly lower than the blade. The blade is short, only 35 mm long from the faint stop, but would have originally been more crescentic and has since worn away during use and is now only slightly flanged. The surface of the axehead is quite worn and pitted but there is no active bronze disease.



Needham (1979) illustrates similar small axes from Teignmouth in Devon and Gerrans in Cornwall on pages 273-4,  figs.6-7, no.4 which are part of the Arreton repertoire from the early Middle Bronze Age, c.1700-1500 BC.



Moore and Rowlands (1972) illustrate a similar flanged axe with low side flanges, no stop ridge and a short blade on page 52, pl.VI, no.10, which is dated from the Arreton phase in the early Middle Bronze Age, c.1700-1500 BC.

746068,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"A fragment of a cast copper-alloy 'Sussex Loop' bracelet of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1400-1250 BC. The fragment consists of one-half of one of the double loop strands, which is lozenge-shaped in cross-section and terminates in the flattened sub-oval terminal hook, which would have fitted the arm band to the other looped element of the bracelet. The apex of the lozenge cross-section has been decorated with small incised lines, positioned slightly obliquely across the apex. The terminal end has been further decorated with two other raised ridges flanking the central apex mentioned above and one of these also bears the traces of small incised oblique lines, whereas the other ridge is too worn to discern this decoration. The entire fragment has an overall dark green patina and colour and the break across the centre of the arm band is flat and distinct, similar to the cuts in 'Sussex Loop' bracelets found in Middle Bronze Age hoards from Sussex (cf. Treasure case 2011 T192, the 'Near Lewes' Middle Bronze Age hoard). The fragment measures 86.47 mm long, 45.1 mm wide, 10.16 mm thick and weighs 69.28 grams.



Discussion: 'Sussex Loop' bracelets have been attributed this title because nearly all known examples originate from the Brighton-Lewes East Sussex area. Recently, a further two Sussex Loop bracelets were discovered in Surrey and given the Treasure number: 2013T316. These examples were the furthest discovery point away from the original examples and potentially the only non-Sussex examples known and were designated finds of significance for this reason. This example, having been discovered in West Sussex is another example of a non-Brighton-Lewes area bracelet and as such, begins to raise issues with this type of bracelet being designated as only coming from this locality. However, because of the reasonable radius of the new discoveries from the original ones, it is still possible that these could be items of local manufacture and circulation.","
This fragment was subjected to XRF metallurgical analysis by Dr. Jaime Kaminski at the University of Brighton. Dr. Kaminski confirms that the alloy used here is similar in composition to others of this type and as such, should be stylistically and compositionally acceptable for identification as a 'Sussex Loop' fragment in spite of missing other diagnostic elements to old damage.

The lower part of the object consists of an inverted-sub-conical plug. The upper end of this plug bifurcates into 3 circular-sectioned arms, each with a vertical, flat outer face.



Casting jets are waste products which form at the top of a two-piece clay mould when the molten metal has filled the object-shaped void below. As they represent re-usable metal, they were often retained and regularly turn up in founder's hoards of the period. Given the jets size it is unlikely to be from brooch production and is more likely to relate to a large object such as an axe, dagger or sword. Similar to BH-8BDE6E, BH-4D6780 and ESS-39BA43

746362,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete decorated flat axe of the Early Bronze Age, dating from c. 2000 BC - 1700 BC. This fits with Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.



The flat axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid(pointed oval), with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid. The axe is broken toward the butt of the axe, but more than three-quarters of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; however a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This has been formed from hammering and small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces where the metal has been worked to form them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, just forming a change of angle between the face of the butt and the face of the blade. Below the bevel (change of angle) the sides continue to expand. The area from the edge of the butt to the junction with the blade facet is decorated on both faces of the axe. The decoration is formed from a series of parallel linear lentoid lozenges. This form of decoration is known as rain-pattern and is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. It stops at the blade facet. The side edge of the axe have been abraded heavily and it is difficult to tell whether there is any further decoration. Beneath the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is present. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge.



The axe measures 98.1 mm in length, it is 30.4 mm wide at the butt and the blade is 78.6 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 9.2 mm, the blade is 5.7 mm thick, and at the median ridge the axe is 11.3 mm thick. It weighs 210.8 g.



The axe is a mid green in colour with a highly polished patina, which has been damaged in areas. Where this had occurred it is probably as a direct result of movement in the plough soil. This abrasion is most evident on the reverse of the axe. There are, however, a series of large scars which have removed areas of decoration. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. On the front surface of the axe to the right and towards the blade is an area of unusual blue/green corrosion. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Some of this abrasion is modern and has cut through the patina and corrosion revealing the dull gold colour of the meatl beneath. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the decorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. This axehead forms part of the corpus of earliest bronze axes of Britain. They are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Other examples of this type of axehead have been recorded in Rhon and Needham (1998), page 125, No 57, and have been recorded on the database, including HESH-299826 and SWYOR-F748BE.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,210.8,,,11.3,98.1,1,Helen Glenn (Derby),Helen Glenn (Derby),East Midlands,Derbyshire,High Peak,Wormhill,SK1274,From finder,53.26286536,-1.82156013,DENO-4F12EB,,DENO4F12EB_2.jpg,Early Bronze Age: Migdale Type Decorated Axe head,Derby Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/helenglenn3/DENO4F12EB_2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/541940.jpg

748515,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Primary / Early Bronze Age copper-alloy Group II palstave (1500-1300 BC): The blade of the palstave is sub-trapezoidal in plan with slightly concave sides, and flared blade tips. On one face of the blade there is a feint single mid rib which appears to continue to the mid section of the blade. The other face, where they may have been a mid rib, there is an off-centre low-relief score mark or damage, but this is not recent. The edge bevel to the blade is 16.58mm deep. The cutting edge appears to be symmetrical. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. The edges of the blade, on both faces, are slightly raised with flanges running down the flaring blade. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. Both sides of the blade have a feint trace of a casting seam.



The palstave, on both faces, has a prominent stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. Before the stop ridge, on one face, there is a small, shallow depression which is probably not a shield-shaped/pattern decoration. The flange sides are a sub oval in profile with casting seams.



In plan the septrum is rectangular and the butt has a broken corner, and this is not a recent break. The patina of the break appears to match the surface of the palstave. On one face of the septrum there is a small patch of active corrosion which is in a slight depression, and appears to reveal a void beneath this patch of corrosion.



The two faces of the palstave have differing corrosion products occurring, one side has a dark brown patina with some encrustation. The other face has a mottled grey and green matte surface. On one side face there is fresh metal visible due to recent damage.



The palstave measures 153mm long from the blade cutting edge to the butt, 70.36mm wide from one blade tip to the other, and 28.48mm thick across the stop ridges. It weighs 402g.



The palstave is an early/primary example and is classified as a Group II type, probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages. Needham Period 5, Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC



Peter Reavill comments '... Looking at Burgess and Schmidt - we could probably suggest, using their typology, that this is a Early Palstave Group II - Early Mid-ribbed Type Liswerry. Being similar to an example from Whinfell, Cumbria (p127 cat no 794 plate 58) and Roundhay, West Riding, Yorkshire (ibid: 794a) In the discussion they say that Liswerry implements have elegant narrow form similar to the earlier flanged axes - they tend to have narrow bodies blade sides that diverge little from the butt and then flare to form widely expanded blade with deeply curved cutting edge and defined blade tips. Further they have flange extensions that descend well down the blade conjoining with a well-defined chamfered cutting edge - and the mid-rib is also long. (ibid 126)'.



Regarding the nature of the surface condition of the palstave, this may be reflecting deposition conditions. Peter Reavill suggests that the iron stained patina may have occurred if deposited in a waterlogged area, or at least had been recovered from an archaeological strata at the junction between the plough and undisturbed sub-soil where an iron pan was formed.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-07-15T23:00:00Z,2015-09-29T23:00:00Z,,,,,,,,1,Peter Reavill,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Rugby,Clifton upon Dunsmore,SP5276,From finder,52.37957621,-1.23750407,WAW-245FB6,,WAW245FB6.jpg,"Bronze Age Palstave (profile, plan, profile, blade terminal, plan, butt terminal).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW245FB6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/538607.jpg

749072,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy flat axehead, sub-rectangular in plan and section and triangular in profile, with a rounded end and broken edge where it is missing its blade and more than half of the axe so that just the butt end remains. This end, opposite the blade end, would have been hafted to a wooden handle. The fragment tapers slightly towards the butt end which is rounded off and widens towards the broken edge which has been partly chiselled off, but has since softened through corrosion and wear. The axehead would have continued to expand into a triangular flat blade which is now missing. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on the surface of the axe, but the original surface has corroded away and is now very pitted, so that preservation is poor. There are many circular depressions on the surface that have been caused by blisters forming as the axehead has corroded and then breaking down and powdering away.





The length is 50 mm, the width of broken edge is 32 mm and the width of the butt end is 26.5 mm, the thickness of the broken end is 8 mm and the thickness of the butt end is 5 mm.



Similar slender flat axes with straight-sided butt ends can be seen in records CORN-6C605C, DENO-93FB17, SUR-E3F467, LANCUM-6507C2, and SOMDOR-C71623 on the database.



Even though it is incomplete, the remains of this flat axe compares well to other examples from the Migdale tradition of the early Bronze Age, dating from c.2200-2000BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates similar examples of slender Migdale type flat axes from Tregonjeeves Quarry in Cornwall and Salcombe in Devon, on pages 400 & 453, plates 1 & 38, nos.6 & 289, and a similar fragment of a flat axe that has been chiselled at one end from Penzance, Cornwall on page 423, pl. 15, no.123, which are associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest slender Migdale type of flat axes to be recorded in the South West from Braddock Downs in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawrton in Devon and Burton in Dorset on page 87, pl.14, nos.36, 111 & 213.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

There is a slight bend about a quarter of the length down the bar behind the largest bladed end. It appears that both ends of this object were designed to be used, probably within the hand without being mounted or hafted into a handle or the like.

The socket is 20 mm long, 5 mm wide and 13 mm deep on the side that is intact. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has partly corroded away and there are patches of light green bronze disease at the broken edges.

755056,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"An early Middle Bronze Age copper alloy side looped spear head, probably dating to c. 1600-1400 BC. The spearhead was found in two parts, and subsequently pinned and the join obscured by green, probably acrylic-based paint. That the break fits would suggest that it was fairly recent damage, rather than an intentional feature of the object's deposition.



The spearhead has an abraded piriform blade, surviving to 19.6mm wide at its shoulders and tapering into a worn break below the point, 10.8mm wide. The blade has a central rib, sub-lozengiform in cross section, flanked by the largely flat wings of the blade, in thickness this mid-rib is 6.8mm at the break, and 12.6mm at the juncture between the blade and socket. This is is sub-circular in cross section and sub-connical in form, tapering from 16.8mm in width at the mouth to 9.6mm at the juncture between the socket and blade. In profile the spearhead tapers continuously from the mouth of the socket, 18.0mm thick, to the break at its point. Two integral, incomplete side loops expand from opposing sides of the socket, on the same plane as the wings of the blade. The depth of the socket could not be measured, with it being blocked by the abovementioned repairs.



A small amount of wood was found preserved within the socket.



Dimensions: Length 116.5mm; width 19.6mm; thickness 18.0mm; weight 56.96g.



A spearhead of very similar form and proportions is published by Pearce (1984: 457, no. 309), from Pinhay and now in the collections of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter. cf. DOR-2D27D7 on this database, which is also very similar. In LANCUM-7609C0 Dr Dot Boughton notes ""Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC.

755698,Mount,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-800,"Description: A Bronze Age gold decorative band dating 2200-800BC. This is a circular band of gold with parallel sides and stamped and incised decoration. There is no visible seam. The decoration comprises an irregular line of dots running along the midline of this band; the dots have been stamped through from the reverse. There is an incised line running both above and below the line of dots forming borders. The shape of the band is distorted and irregular.



Dimensions: height: 4.4mm; thickness: 0.3mm; diameter: 25mm; weight: 1.41g.



Metal composition: Analysis by Dr Harriet White (British Museum) established that the precious metal content is more than 10% and the composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date: ""Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the decorated band from London, indicated a surface composition of approximately 85-86% gold, 13-14% silver, and less than 1% copper. The decorated band weighs 1.42 g."" (Department of Scientific Research, British Museum, File No. 7643-2 2015 T941, 20th January 2017)



Discussion: No exact parallel is known for this object but the decoration of goldwork with dot and incised line decoration is a known feature of (Early) Bronze Age goldwork (e.g. Taylor 1970) and the metal composition does not disagree with a Bronze Age date. The function of the object is unclear but it is unlikely to have been a finger ring and is more likely to have been a fitting, perhaps comparable to dagger hilt bands of this period, although these differ in form and decoration from this find.

756860,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy sword blade, sub rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in profile and section. Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is at the end that tapers towards the tip or point, as any raised area has flattened out in section. The surface of the blade has more corrosion product and is more pitted on one face than the other, probably due to exposure. There are also gashes and later damage on both faces, which has happened since deposition. The fragment may be a result of deliberate decomissioning of a sword into separate pieces before it was ritually destroyed, or it may have been broken up in order to melt it down and re-use the metal. The two broken edges may also have been subsequently trimmed in order to re-use the weapon as a tool such as a razor or scraper.



The lozenge-shaped section of the blade without a defined central mid-rib suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.

It is also possible that this item dates to the Iron Age or later and this is also discussed below. The remaining fragment is a portion of one of the cauldron's handle loops, but this fragment has broken off from the larger vessel, now missing. The fragment is curved in profile, with three deeply grooved ridges on the outer surface, which have been indented along the centre, suggesting that another element abutted this area. The interior edge of the loop is smooth and undecorated. Both surfaces have a dark green patina and colour. This fragment measures 19.2mm long, 13.1mm wide, 3.4mm thick and weighs 3.78 grams.



A parallel with additional portions of the vessel attachment has been recorded onto the PAS database as: SF-832744 . That example was extensively discussed by specialists and a portion of that discussion is included here:



'This is a handle from a large sheet copper-alloy cauldron. Parallels in the Late Bronze Age are noted with Gerloff's (1986) Class A cauldrons, notably the Shipton Type and Tulnacross Type caulrons (Gerloff, 1986: pp. 93-97, cf. fig. 10 for examples from the Isleham Hoard; see Ashmolean Museum AN 1928.324 for the Shipton-on-Cherwell cauldron). See also examples of buckets with similar handles in Gerloff (2004), notably from Hatfield (Gerloff, 2004: fig. 17.4). These would indicate a date range in the Late Bronze Age Penard to Ewart Park phases, perhaps c.1200-700 BC. However, similarities with later, Iron Age, examples are also evident, such as in parallels from Sheepen in Essex (Colchester Caslte Museum) and the Battersea Cauldron (BM 1861, 0309.1), which have similar sheet construction and cast copper-alloy handles. The current example is quite possibly Late Bronze Age in date, perhaps as early as the last quarter of the 2nd millennium BC, however a later (Iron Age or later) date range cannot be ruled out entirely.'",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-10-27T00:00:00Z,2015-10-27T00:00:00Z,,,3.78,,,3.4,19.2,1,Stephanie Smith,Liz Walker,Eastern,Norfolk,Breckland,East Tuddenham,TG0812,Generated from computer mapping software,52.66578814,1.07453739,SUSS-8438EC,,SUSS8438ECFragmentofUncertainObject.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/stephaniesmith/SUSS8438ECFragmentofUncertainObject.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/544473.jpg

758435,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The profile of the axe is an irregular pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In cross section the body of the axe has a slight H-shape as the side edges of the axe have been raised by hand hammering to form slight flanges, and therefore forming a curved sloped to the base of the spetum. The depth between the height of the flanges and base of the centre of the spetum is 1.23mm. The flanges appear to have been cast an probably augmented by hammering. The sides of the axe are slightly convex bulging outwards slightly from the upper edge of the 'H' section; there is no decoration present and the casting flanges have been trimmed filled and hammered flat. The centre of the sides, running from the butt to the start of the blade, has a flattened band at the apex of the convex face. On both faces of the axe there is a slight bump / rib / proto-stop ridge, measuring 44.90mm from the apex of the butt. 80.82mm from the apex of the butt, on each face there is a very slight ridge when the blade then tapers which is the median bevel. On one face the space between the bump/rib-stop and the median bevel is very slightly undulating, on the other face the space is slightly concave. In plan the sides of the blade flare outwards towards the blade tips. One blade tip is complete and is a blunt point, the other is slightly rounded. Both the tips have lost their patina, but the shaping is perhaps due to use rather than recent damage. In plan the cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical. There is no obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge, only the slight ridge which is 24.17mm from the apex of the cutting edge. The surface of the axe has a well developed, mottled dark green to brown patina, which is slightly pitted on the blade. When the surface is reflected in a good light there is a hint of a shiny fine grey glittery surface which is likely to be due to leaching of the alloys in the burial environment where the tin element is better preserved.



The axe measures 103.92mm long, 62.85mm across from blade tip to blade tip, 12.18mm thick at the bump/rib-stop, and weighs 180.31g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.

759038,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-1000,"Circumstances of discovery



Three objects found together on 29 November 2003 using a metal-detector. Subsequent excavation on the find-spot, conducted by David Williams, Finds Liaison Officer for Surrey, has shown an important relationship to ancient, probably Bronze Age, landscape features. Furthermore, the hoard appears to have lain beneath a small cairn of tightly packed flint nodules.





Description



Palstave 1 (axehead)



A palstave with a gently flared and heavy blade ornamented with a stout trident rib design. The stop, at the blade/haft end junction is massive and protrudes well beyond the linking flanges in profile. The side loop is unusually thick and has an octagonal cross-section. The septum floor is effectively flat with a sharp angle where it meets the inner flange faces.





Length 184 mm;  width blade 49 mm; weight 623.5 g





Palstave 2



The second palstave is rather different in style. The blade starts parallel at the top, then expands progressively towards the convex cutting edge. It too carries stout ‚Äòdecoration‚Äô, this time just a single medial rib on either face, giving the upper blade a hexagonal section. The stop shows similar protuberance relative to the flanges as seen on palstave 1, while the septum floor is again flat with strong angles along the flanges. The loop is slighter with a sub-oval cross-section.





Length 168 mm;  width blade 52 mm; weight 492.1 g





Chape (sword-scabbard terminal)



A thin-walled socketed fitting, the socket of which continues to within 6 mm of the terminal. The body of chape is rhombic-sectioned with the addition of narrow flattened sides throughout its length. At the end it expands slightly into a sub-lozenge ‚Äòbutton‚Äô terminal. The mouth is very gently V-shaped in plan view. Two neat perforations on opposing faces provide for rivet fixings to the wood or leather lining of the scabbard.





Length 157.5 mm; width mouth 40 mm; weight 72.5 g





Metal composition



No analysis has been conducted, but there is no doubt that these are copper-alloy objects, of either bronze or leaded bronze.","Identification



The two palstaves, although different in detail, are united by features characteristic of the Late type. These include relatively narrow blades and the specific stop/flange/septum form. Late palstaves belong to the Late Bronze Age between circa 1150 and 800 BC. Associated finds suggests that there are some significant shifts in style between the earlier and later half of this period, but the full range of variation as seen in extant axes is not yet represented in hoards. This gives considerable importance to the association in the Mickleham hoard of two style variants with a more closely dated bronze type.





The chape belongs to the ‚Äòtongue-shaped‚Äô family. Long tongue chapes occur in both the Wilburton metalwork assemblage and in some early Ewart hoards (Blackmoor stage), the full potential span being circa 1150-900 BC. However, the near straight mouth of the Mickleham example is not found in the later group and so it can almost certainly be attributed to the Wilburton stage, circa 1150-1000 BC.





Conclusion



The Mickleham bronzes were clearly found together as a closed group and had probably been sealed under a small flint cairn at about the same time. They date to the Wilburton stage of the Late Bronze Age and are eligible as Treasure under the new Treasure Order (2002) being a base-metal prehistoric associated find containing two or more metal objects.

762924,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1350,"A near complete copper alloy Middle Bronze Age dirk, dating to the period c. 1550-1350 BC. The trapezoidal hilt plate / butt end is damaged by movement in the plough zone; however, the remains of two rivet holes are discernible on the feathered external edge. A further slight notch is present on the exterior edge which may possibly suggest the handle was originally fixed with four rivets. The original mushroom rivets are all lost. The dirk is widest across the trapezoidal plate - below this the shoulders narrow to form the blade which is a flattened lozenge (lentoid) shape in cross section. The blade has a distinctive central rib which extends to the tip / point of the blade. This thickened rib adds strength to the blade and is a diagnostic feature of this type of short sword or dirk which is thought to be used for thrusting and piercing rather than cutting and slashing. The cutting edges of the blade are complete but have been damaged in places by movement in the soil. There seem to be no direct notches in the cutting edge (caused through use / parrying blows). The dirk is a mid green colour with a well preserved surface patina which is pitted, particularly on one side, by surface corrosion. Area of distinct patinated longitudinal scratches are present on both sides of the blade and lower part of the hilt plate - these marks are most likely caused through use / sharpening rather than as a result of the burial environment. The dirk has been bent at c. 45 degrees. The centre of the bend is on the upper part of the blade / soon after the butt end narrows into the blade. This bending has resulted in patinated transverse stress fractures / striations on the outer face of the bend, and a large area missing the surface on the inner face. The position of the bend suggests that the hilt was present when the blade was deliberately damaged; hilts in this period were organic being made of bone, horn, or wood. Such bending is common on metal deliberately deposited within ritual environments - specifically areas on the edge of wetlands. The findspot lies in an area rich in paleo-channels suggesting that it would have been placed in a marginal area prior to modern drainage. The dirk is best attributed to Burgess and Gerloff's (1981) Group II as it has an undecorated form with central rib, flattened lozenge cross section and a trapezoidal butt end / hilt plate. The dating of this type fits with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking stages of the Middle Bronze Age - which corresponds with Needham (1996) Period 5 and Burgess's Metalworking stage IX.

762987,Ear Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"A gold loop of uncertain function made of square cross-sectioned rod that has been bent into a sub-circle shape, one side is slightly distorted and straight and the terminals are over-lapping. The rod is thickest at its centre and thinnest at the terminals.



Dimensions: Weight: 8.44g; Diameter: 22mm by 22mm; Thickness: 5mm (max.) - 1mm (min.)



Metal composition:

Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the ear-ring carried out by the British Museum's Department of Scientific Research indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-87 % gold, 11-12 % silver and at least 1% copper. The ear-ring weighs 8.44 grams.



Discussion:

Gold rod with square cross-section is a typical feature of both Middle and Late Bronze Age British ornaments (cf. Eogan 1994), but is rarely found in other periods. The precise form of the gold loop is not closely paralleled by other known examples bar and usual copper alloy penannular ring found in Hampshire (PAS-HAMP114), also of uncertain but probably later Bronze Age in date. The metal composition does not disagree with this statement.

763690,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"An incomplete cast copper alloy tanged spear / spearhead of Early Bronze Age (Arreton industry) date (1700-1500 BC). The object is broken across the lower blade and the tang and butt of the blade are preserved. The blade would have been lanceolate in shape (being broadly triangular in plan) and has a pronounced, raised central rib terminating at the junction with the tang. This rib is present on both faces of the blade. The cross section of the blade is lentoid (lanceolate). The tang is integrally cast and rectangular in shape; it tapers toward the butt end where the lower edge is broken across a oval shaped rivet hole. Sub rectangular depressions are present on both faces on the upper part of the tang. The outer edges of the blade are heavily abraded and both the ends of the object terminate in old patinated but abraded breaks. The metal is a mid-brown in colour with a thick well preserved surface patina on most faces; where abrasion has removed this patina patches of light green, pitted corrosion are present. This form of spearhead is relatively rare with only 47 examples recorded in the recent volume British Bronze Age Spearheads (Davis 2012). This form of spearhead corresponds with  Davis's (2012) Group I form and of Arreton Down metalworking dating to the latest part of the Early Bronze Age, (Early Bronze Age III) which correspondes to Needham's (1996) Period 4 dated c. 1700 - 1500BC and Burgess's Metalworking stage VII.  Two similar examples of Arreton metalworking tradition spearheads are recorded on the PAS database from Penllyn, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0BF252) and Shalfleet, Isle of Wight (IOW-221956) . 



An image of this was sent to Richard Davis (University of Nottingham) who comments:



[This is an] Arreton tanged spearhead. However some of its attributes do not match any of the 47 that I have recorded in the PBF book. The blade base has a protruding ridge or rib which is not present on other tanged spearheads. This, however, is found on some of the early socketed spearheads (Arreton phase). The narrow vertical, central rib on the blade is not present on other tanged spearheads, but again this attribute is similar to some on the early socketed spearheads. The indentation on the upper face of the tang is unique. It may have been designed as a seating for some form of bronze collar which also abutted the ridged blade base (see the well known Snowshill spearhead). The length of the tang and the broken peg hole is typical of the tanged spearheads of this type

Description: The spearhead has been broken just over midway along the broad leaf shaped blade. Both edges where remaining has been heavily abraded along their edge, leaving them uneven. There is a pronounced conical mid rib that is hollow from the socket to the majority of the way through the blade. Where it has broken giving a cross-section of the rib shows it to be solid nearish to the point. There is a substantial mould line along the side of the shaft. There is only one loop on the spearhead, abutting the blade. There does not appear to be any breaks, swelling or any other suggestion that another loop existed on the other side. It is a small hemispherical loop



The spearhead is a dark brown colour with frequent patchesof rough light green corrosion product likely bronze disease.

Discussion:



This spearhead is odd for a number of reasons. Firstly single looped spearheads are very rare (with only one example to this date on the database: DUR-F54FE1), Those with abutting loops to the blade are similarly uncommon. Secondly these types are not known from the south-east and are more commonly found in Northern Britain and Ireland. Thirdly this exmaple from Kent while sharing identifying features does not fit all the attributes of the aformentioned northern and Irish groups and is, at present, unique in the archaeological record.","

Richard Davis (Bronze Age specialist in Spearheads of University of Nottingham) comments:



This spearhead has transitional characteristics between the protected looped spearheads of the Middle Bronze Age and the lunate spearheads of the Late Bronze Age. The rib (ridge/flange/fillet) which runs all round the blade apertures is matched by a similar one on the spearhead from Ardmillam which I classified as protected-looped. The rib is larger and cruder than on the Late Bronze Age lunate spearheads. The blade shape with the strong concave line of the blade edges from above the lunates to the tip are present on several Late Bronze Age lunate spearheads, but is not as marked on protected-looped spearheads. The blade openings are larger than those of the protected-looped spearheads.



Based on these attributes this spearhead seems to be a transitional design somewhere in the continuum between the protected-looped, and the mature lunate spearheads typified by those from the Blackmoor hoard. This would date it to the late Middle Bronze Age (MBA III) or early Late Bronze Age (LBA I). The two protected-looped spearheads that have been tested had a low lead formulation typical of the Middle Bronze Age, while the lunate spearheads generally had a high lead formulation typical of Late Bronze Age metalwork. 



To date the metal of this spearhead has not been tested.

From the PAS website: http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl Awls are difficult to date but most are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments. Referred to as ""pointed punches"" by Coles (1963-64 117). They were presumably used for perforating leather, but it was once suggested that they were used for tattooing human skin. Dating and areas of discovery



However, as a functional object the form of the awl barely changes from the Bronze Age to Medieval periods and a selection of broadly comparable awls are recorded in Ottaway and Rogers (2002).

767708,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1150,"A nearly complete cast copper-alloy palstave type of Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1550-1150 BC. The palstave has a U shaped shield-shaped pattern below the stop ridge on both sides of the palstave, which is concave, bordered on either side by the flange facets and with a central ridge in its middle. The cutting edge of the axe is convex and bevelled, while in section the piece is sub-lenticular and the blade is sub-triangular in plan view with convex flaring sides. At the middle of the depression below the stop ridge on the sides of the axe, the palstave has been slightly shouldered with two reasonably prominent ridges. The area of the axe comprising the stop-ridge and the butt with the septum in between is sub-triangular in section and sub-rectangular in plan-view, though at the upper edge of the axe this is irregular due to the breakage at the butt end. 



The palstave survives well with a relatively even green patina except for some small losses to the cutting edge and to the extremities of the butt end. In some places, the patina is relatively pitted with some brown mineralised deposits visible in places. 

It measures 152.65mm long from the broken end of the butt to the point of the blade, 30mm wide at the stop ridge, 28.65mm wide at the midpoint of the flange-facets and 23.18mm wide at the broken butt-terminal. The cutting edge of the axe is 56.86mm wide, and from the cutting edge to the stop-ridge the axe measures 85.81mm long. At the thickest point of the flange-facets the axe is 26.34mm thick and at the mid-point of the blade the axe is 12.68 mm thick. The axe weighs 488 grammes. 



This palstave is comparable to nos. 146 and 151 in Savory's catalogue (Savory 1980, pp. 104-105) as well as LVPL-1FDB7C on the PAS database, which the recorder assigns to the primary phase of the Middle Bronze Age.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-01-12T00:00:00Z,,,,488,,,26.34,152.65,1,Alex Bliss as Finder,Alex Bliss as Finder,South East,West Sussex,Horsham,Ashington,TQ1116,From finder,50.93277801,-0.42177696,PUBLIC-CB5542,,unspecified50.jpg,Middle Bronze Age palstave type axe,Sussex Archaeological Society,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abliss/unspecified50.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/561691.jpg
767954,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1150,"A Middle/Late Bronze Age copper alloy leaf-shaped spearhead. The spear is well preserved and has very sharp blade edges. The tip and the socket are both broken and there are the remains of one side loop. The spearhead has a sharp ridge between the blades. The socket length is 47.59mm.



Richard Davis suggests that this spearhead can be identified as a Group 6 Developed Side-looped spearhead. It may be dated to the MBA - the later Acton Park and Taunton phases, and possibly the early part of the Penard phase. The lozenge shaped midrib and the prominent midrib ridge are typical of this type. There are remains of the top of the side loop at the bottom of the lower part of the socket remaining. Davis argues further that it appears that the spearhead was purposely damaged in antiquity with the tip and lower socket broken off, and the hole pierced in the lower midrib. This suggests some form of ritual destruction, possibly the weapon of a defeated opponent.

In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being after the stop ridge.



The blade, from the cutting edge to the stop ridge, is 66.42mm in length and 22.86 thick, measured close to the stop ridge. The cutting edge is 41.60mm in width and 2.72mm thick.



Beneath the stop-ridge, on both sides of the palstave, is a concave depression, which is bordered by raised ridges. This is broadly sub-rectangular (U-shaped), with three parallel grooves going down to the septum to facilitate the process of hafting. One face of the palstave preserve, near the three grooves of the septum, a through hole linked with forging activities.

The latter record discusses the dating of socketed hammers stating that 'early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding'. SF-40FAAD also states that 'hammers were in use in Britain during the Taunton metalwork phase of the MBA, with slender hammers appearing in both the Taunton and Bishopsland hoards and a massive hammer in the Burgess's Meadow, Oxford hoard' (O'Connor 1980, vol.1, 61).

774654,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy sword blade, rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in profile and in section, with a raised but flattened mid-rib that rises about 1 mm above the surface of the blade on both sides and averages about 10 mm in width. Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is likely between the hilt and the middle of the sword as this is where the blade tapers before expanding at the mid point. The fragment may be a result of deliberate decomissioning of a sword into separate pieces before it was ritually destroyed, or it may have been broken up in order to melt it down and re-use the metal. The two broken edges look like they were subsequently trimmed in order to re-use the weapon as a tool such as a razor or scraper. The wider broken end has a semi-circular notch that is 5 mm in diameter and has been deliberately produced as part of a rivet hole and this would not be where the hilt was riveted to the handle so it must be for later hafting when the fragment was re-used. The smooth dark green patina survives on both faces of the blade but the abraded edges are actively corroding. There are also flakes and gashes that have been caused from post-depositional damage that are also corroding and are light green in colour.



The lozenge-shaped section of the blade with a raised central mid-rib suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.



Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate two similar lozenge-shaped sections of Ewart Park swords on page 135, fig.37, nos.386-7.

774801,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy socketed axe, with just the blade surviving, rectangular in plan and in section, and triangular in profile. The blade is narrow with straight sides with a slight taper towards the broken end so that the blade is slightly flanged, but one side is damaged and incomplete so that the actual edge is unclear. The cutting edge of the blade is rounded and blunt, though affected by corrosive pitting and later damage. The broken end of the blade, which is 39 mm wide and 14.5 mm thick, is just below the end of the socket which would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe. The original surface has mostly corroded away, with patches of dark green patina, but much of the surface is covered in light green bronze disease. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, also refered to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but sparse. They date from the end of the Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase, and into Hallstatt C (c.800-700 BC).

775022,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy spear probably dating to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (c. 1500-800 BC). The fragment consists of the tip of the spear blade, which is triangular in plan. The tip is slender with a pronounced middle rib which tapers to the edges in 'wings', creating a rounded lozenge-shaped cross section. The shaft opening is circular in shape on the underside and is completely filled with soil and other possible material, but seems to have been socketed. The metal is of a medium green colour, with substantial areas of darker green patina on all surfaces. The spear tip measures 39.5mm long, 14.5mm wide at the break and 6.7mm thick; it weighs 6.67 grams.

775027,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-300,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy Bronze Age copper alloy chisel probably a broken tang. The object is flat and rectangular in plan. The upper end has suffered an old break and is very worn. The fragment is ovoid in section towards the break and expands slightly in width at the centre. From this expansion, the lower section is triangular in section and tapers to a point which is rounded in plan. The sides of the lower section are slightly thicker than the flattened central area, possibly indicating that the edges had raised sides which are now worn to almost the same thickness as the rest of the fragment. It has a dark green patina and a smoothed surface.



Tanged chisels and awls have few diagnostic features and change little through time, making their dating and identification more difficult. The attention to detail with the decorative facets around the head, may be suggestive of a Bronze Age date. Bronze Age awls and narrow chisels are not common finds and their dating is further hampered by a lack of associated datable artefacts within hoards but tend to date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 1250-800BC, but maybe much later.

The blade is a pointed oval form with a distinct, raised central rib which runs down the length of both sides of the object to the base of the socket. The socket has a side loop, lozengiform in plan and almost flat in cross-section on each side. There are casting seams visible down the length of the shaft. Small sections of the edge of the socket are broken and missing, however a retained semi-circular portion on one side of the socket suggests a peg hole in the shaft. The socket has been distorted by post depositional processes and is twisted and missing a large portion below the side loops.



The metal is a dark greenish brown in colour with a slightly pitted patina.

776826,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"A fragment of Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1150BC) palstave axe-head, surviving only as the cutting edge and a tiny amount of the mid-rib body. The cutting edge is a wide convex crescent shape in plan. The blade is very short and has a steep drop from the body to the cutting edge, with some clear hammer blows and polishing striations visible on the surface. These features suggest an axe-head which has been maintained, the metal redrawn via hammering and re-sharpened a significant number of times. It is difficult to suggest the extent of this maintenance/reuse as palstaves dating from the latter end of the period tend to have shorter blades. Features to place this example within a chronological group have not survived, thus being able to suggest its shortness relates only to reuse and rather than style is not possible. At the broken end, which equates to the beginning of the palstave's likely rectangular body, a subtle shadow suggests the rib indicating its classification as a palstave axe. The break appears to be relatively recent and almost certainly relates to modern agricultural process. The fragment is very dark green on the body with a slightly different more olive green along the cutting edge.

777234,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"Copper alloy developed flat axe of Aylesford type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981). The axe is dark yellowish brown with an even surface patina except in a few places where green patina is visible. There are a number of shallow grooves on both faces of the blade indicative of use rather than recent damage in the ploughsoil. It measures 58 mm in length but the butt is missing. The break is just behind a median bevelled stop and is patinated consistent with the rest of the axe perhaps suggesting breakage in use. Width at the crescentic cutting edge is 50.5 mm and the axe weighs 89.3 gm with a maximum thickness of 9.2 mm. It has vertically faceted sides worked into slight flanges. No evidence for decoration. It is very similar to an axe from Hutton Cranswick, East Riding, Yorkshire (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p. 61 & Plate 37, 316). The axe fits within Needham's Period 3 (MA IV) 2050-1700 CAL BC (Needham, 1996).

777635,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"A fragment of a copper alloy palstave dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age c. 1500 - 1150 BC. The fragment is sub-rectangular in shape the butt and a fragment of the flanged sides survive. The axe has anangular butt and the sides gradually widen towards the break. Both sides of the palstave have high developed flanges, which increase gradually from the butt to from sub-triangular sides. The sides are unfinished, as you can still see the ridges from the casting process.



The faces of the axe fragment are slightly concave, creating a H-shaped cross-section. The faces of the axe show signs of wear, such as scratches and the break is even and patinated, suggesting that the object was broken in antiquity. Due to the fragmentary nature of the object, it is difficult to confidently assign a Type.

777732,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1400,"A complete copper alloy palstave of the Middle Bronze Age Acton Park II period c. 1500-1400 BC. The palstave has a deep flange with upright stop; the butt of the palstave narrows slightly from the septum. Casting lines are visible on either side and there does not appear to be a side loop (unlooped palstave). The blade of the palstave flares gently outwards from the stop and although the blade tips are damaged it does not appear to have had a pronounced crescentic cutting edge. There is a narrow linear indentation on one face of the palstave on the blade below the stop which may be the remains of a shield-shaped indent; this is not repeated on the opposing face and therefore may to the result of of an imperfect mould rather than intentional. The flange is c. 77mm tall at the stop, and the back end of the palstave from the stop measures 65mm in length. The blade is 85.6mm long, 55mm wide and 3.2mm thick at the tip. The whole object is 164mm long. The palstave is suffering from bronze disease on all sufaces.



The lack of a side loop and lack of any ribs suggest it maybe relatively early and is probably of the Acton Park II period, c.1500-1400 BC. It is perhaps similar to example from Cwm Rheidol, Cardiganshire, and Arthog, Merioneth.

780686,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-900,-800,"An incomplete copper alloy Late Bronze Age spearhead (c.900-c.800 BC), missing a fragment from the rim of its socket. The spearhead has a flame-shaped blade with a stepped, bevelled edge cast into the blade. It has two cast peg holes through the centre of its socket which is conical. As the socket tapers, it forms the midrib.



The rim of the socket is broken; an old break, possibly caused by the 'ritual killing' of the spear (a common practice in the Bronze Age). The edge of the blade has suffered some erosion and there is a small dent in the midrib, but otherwise the spearhead is in perfect condition. It has a smooth, shiny, dark green patina. There is no evidence on the object to suggest that spear was used prior to deposition.



The shape of the spearhead fits into Richard Davis' Class 11a (2015) and dates to the period c.1100-c.800 BC. However, this type of spearhead arrived later in Nottinghamshire and is more likely to date to c.900-c.800 BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Acquired by a museum - not a Treasure case,Metal detector,2015-12-01T00:00:00Z,2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,,,112.21,,,26.3,172,1,Alastair Willis,Alastair Willis,East Midlands,Nottinghamshire,Newark and Sherwood,Rufford,SK6362,Generated from computer mapping software,53.15142036,-1.05941975,DENO-F70BF6,,DENOF70BF6.jpg,Late Bronze Age Spearhead,Derby Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENOF70BF6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/565017.jpg

782914,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete cast copper alloy flanged (developed) flat axe of later Early Bronze Age date. The axehead is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescentic blade which tapers to a thin edge. Along the length of the axe are raised flanges and between them and nearly central is a very faint stop ridge. The flanges are bevelled both above and below the main body of the axe and may have been hammered. The butt end is narrowed and rounded and also tapers to a thin edge. Copper alloy corrosion is more prevalent on one side of the axe with the opposing surface having almost none; this would be as a result of the depositional environment.

783810,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1500,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age period, dating from c. 2000-1500 BC.



The flat axe is broadly triangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is a stunted H shape. The butt is relatively thin and appears to have a rounded top, however this has been heavily damaged; the width at the butt is 14.8 mm (thickness: 4.46 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to above the blade where the sides splay to form the blade. However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (11.03 mm). The sides of the axe have a raised ridge on the outside edge of the obverse and the reverse, with a concave dip (or septum) in the centre. There also appears to be a stop ridge or proto-stop ridge at the mid point of the axe. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 39.7 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. Casting 'flaws' or air bubbles are present over most of the surface of the flat axehead. The axe is a mid to dark brown in colour colour, with lighter brown colours on the surface, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axe measures 89.51 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 39.7 mm, width at the butt is 14.8 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 11.03 mm (Thickness of blade: 4.5 mm, thickness of butt: 4.46 mm). It weighs 86.7 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to Aylesford Type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, 60 - 61). These are the earliest of the 'developed' flat axes, and have been found along side Migdale type axes, which would suggest a similar date. These axes fit within metalworking stage IV, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to those identified as Type Aylesford (Burgess and Schmidt: plate 26B, no 310a).

Discussion: The hoard contains a mixture of deliberately broken and miscast objects, as well as some apparently undamaged in antiquity. Two similar objects to no.29 were recovered as part of a Late Bronze Age hoard in Norfolk (nos. 17 and 18 from HER 36176). The total weight of these 29 objects is 2289.5g.



Addendum 3rd October 2016:



Seven additional objects were discovered by the same finder between 10/08/2016 and 14/09/2016. They are as follows:



30. ‚ÄúBugle-shaped‚Äù object. Probable strap or harness fitting. Hollow tubular body with expanded terminals at either end. There is a narrow elongated slot on one side of the body. 21.1mm long and 5.5mm wide on one side of the body. On the opposite side of the body is a side loop, oval in section. There is a shallow groove on the body surrounding the loop. The surface has a silvery patina indicative of a high tin content. Length: 60.6mm; diameter: 11.6mm; weight: 25.8g.



31. Fragment of miscast object, possibly a palstave or chisel. Rectangular-sectioned with an old break at one end. The other end, possibly the blade end is expanded and possibly miscast. Deep cut mark across the blade end on one face and across the butt end on the other face. Length: 35.1mm; width: 28.4mm; thickness: 9.6mm, weight: 44.6g.



32. Fragment of flat-sectioned object, with on slightly curved edge. Possibly a fragment of a socketed axehead. 32.5x30.6mm. Thickness: 2.6mm. Weight: 14.5g.

35. Casting waste. Irregularly shaped. Slightly dished. One face is relatively smooth, the other is pitted. 54.9mmx34.6mm. Thickness: 10.6mm. Weight: 54.4g.



36. Penannular ring. Crushed and distorted gold lock-ring. Triangular in section and formed from three strips of sheet gold. One of the strips is undecorated. The other two faces are composed of a series of twisted gold wires fused, or possibly soldered together. Length: 36.1mm; width: 11.4mm; thickness: 4.5mm; weight: 2.7g.



Discussion: A similar object to no. 30 was recovered as part of the Late Bronze Age Eaton Hoard.","Update: a further socketed axehead was recovered from the same area in January 2018 and reported as 2018T593 (NMS-D74E8B). This was joined by seven further fragments found in November 2018 to give a total of eight items in 2018T593.



In 2022 it was realised that two more fragments of socketed axe (found October 2016) were also part of this hoard, and they have been recorded at NMS-141277 (Treasure number to come).",4,Copper alloy,Gold,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,2016-03-10T00:00:00Z,2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,2016T470,,2289.5,,,,,36,Erica Darch,Erica Darch,Eastern,Norfolk,North Norfolk,Barton Turf,TG3322,,52.74536424,1.45063533,NMS-6DAFAC,,60464_6DAFAC_BA_Hoard_1.jpg,Bronze Age axe head.

783921,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1300,1000,"A Middle Bronze Age (Ornament Horizon) hoard comprising two twisted torcs and two bracelets. Neither the two torcs nor the two bracelets form matching pairs although the pairs are similar in size and form. The hoard includes two torcs of a similar form but with the main difference between them being the number of the ridges formed by twisting (Torc 1 has 43 ridges while Torc 2 has 77 ridges). The two bracelets are significantly different in colour which presumably suggests different alloys. Bracelet 1 is more extensively decorated that Bracelet 2.

The hoard was removed from the ground by the finder who reports that at a depth of two feet one torc was found with one bracelet centred within it. About two inches below this lay the other torc and bracelet similarly positioned.




Torcs

Torc 1. A twisted torc with hooked terminals and with 43 ridges formed by twisting. This torc measures 180mm across and is 10.2mm thick at its widest point. It weighs 143g. Of the two hooked terminals one is now missing (a length of about 25mm), though the break appears fresh, and the other is now detached by a break 67mm along the circumference of the torc.

Torc 2. A twisted torc with holed terminals and with 77 ridges formed by twisting. This torc measures 187mm across and is 11mm thick at its widest point. It weighs 165g. The torc is intact and complete apart from the extreme tip of one of the hooked terminals.




Bracelets

Bracelet 1. An annular bracelet weighing 224g and measuring c.87mm in diameter. The bracelet is c.12mm thick and has a narrow irregular sinuous casting groove around its outer face. This bracelet is heavily decorated with narrow incised lines. On both sides there is a band of herring bone decoration which runs centrally around the circumference. This band is interrupted by three pairs of groups of closely-spaced transverse lines which are confined to 180 degrees of the circle. Between each outer pair is a transverse band of herring bone lines, while between the central pair is a band of lines running at 90 degrees to the transverse lines. The remaining external circumference is filled with groups of closely-spaced diagonal lines which alternate in direction.

The interior face of this bracelet is plain.



Bracelet 2. An annular bracelet weighing 216g and measuring c.84mm in diameter. The bracelet is c.10.2mm thick and has a deep and irregular sinuous casting groove around its inner face and a much narrower irregular groove on its outer face. There is an area of surface loss on one side. The section is less circular than Bracelet 1 and has a flatter inner face. Decoration is confined to a central band of herring bone lines on both sides. This is interrupted at one point only by a transverse band of 17 incised lines.



Discussion: This prehistoric base metal hoard comprises more than one object and therefore should be considered Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 (as amended in 2002).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-05-13T23:00:00Z,,2016T402,,,,,,,4,David W Williams,David W Williams,South East,Hampshire,East Hampshire,Buriton,SU7621,GPS (from the finder),50.98339915,-0.91868822,SUR-9A711C,,DSC01191.JPG,Bronze Age: Hoard,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/DSC01191.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/567947.jpg

784257,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1750,"Copper alloy developed flat axe of miniature form or possibly a chisel of early Bronze age date (2050- 1750 BC). The axe is possibly of Type Bandon, Variant Swinton but it is smaller that so far known examples. The object resembles a miniature version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads. The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow sub-rounded butt and parallel slightly tapering sides which expand to the cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly convex (bowed). In profile and cross section the axehead is lentoid. The patina has broken away leaving a red-brown corroded and pitted surface.



Miniature flat axes such as this tends to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC.



The length is 80mm, the width is 20mm and the thickness 17mm.



The axe is of a diminutive size, if it is a Type Bandon, Variant Swinton and it remains unclear whether the axe had a practical purpose or was votive. It is possible that the 'axe' may have been used for delicate tasks, perhaps similar to a chisel. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.

785246,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-950,"An incomplete copper alloy (bronze) palstave axe with side loop of the Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1050 - c. BC 950.



The blade of the palstave is sub-oval or tongue shaped in plan. The cutting edge measures 34 mm in width and is 6.7 mm thick. The blade is blunt and has been heavily damaged, no cutting edge is visible. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The object measures 27.4 mm in width and 28.4 mm thick at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge the axe has been decorated with two diagonal raised ridges or ribs, forming a triangle, with a vertical ridge in between, on one face of the object. The opposite face, shows evidence of similar decoration below the stop ridge and evidence of a raised mid rib in the centre of the axe.



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is broadly rectangular in plan and broadly triangular in profile, in section it appears as a squashed (or stunted) H shape. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The butt end measures 24.3 mm in width and is 5.9 mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is a broad U shape and measures 61.9 mm in length. The septum is 5.8 mm deep at the stop ridge and the sides have a depth of 3.7 mm. The flanges may have been misscast or more likely have been lost due to abrasion. The remaining edge is rough and undulating. The side loop measures 27.8 mm in length externally and is 8.6 mm in length internally. It is oval in plan and the arms are broadly circular in section.The loop is situated with one arm level with the stop ridge and the other below. There are no visible casting seems.



The object measures 134.8 mm in length, is 34.4 mm wide.It has a maximum thickness of 28.3 mm and weighs 327.9 g.



The object is a mid brown to green in colour and has an uneven patina. There is evidence of bright green copper corrosion on the surface of the axehead.On the front of the object, on the right are traces of the original gold coloured patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



This object is similar to the Type Nettleham axeheads illustrated in Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), plate 67, no 930, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 - BC 950.

785872,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1200,"An incomplete copper alloy Low Flanged Palstave Type axehead probably of the Middle Bronze Age period, dating to c. BC 1300 - c. BC 1200



The blade of the palstave is broadly rectangular in plan with convex expanding sides and a convex blade edge. The cutting edge has been lost and the blade has been damaged extensively. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade has a width at the blade edge of 40.5 mm. The thickness of the blade tip is 5.14 mm. The maximum thickness of the blade is 19.7 mm (measured at a point below the stop ridge; the width at this point is 28.32 mm). Beneath the stop-ridge, on the front side of the palstave, is what appears to be a tapering central faceted rib. This rib is incomplete as much of the patina has been lost. The convex cutting edge of the blade is lost through corrosion, abrasion and probably wear. The exposed edge is asymmetric with one side of the blade being more worn than the other. This may be due to considerable movement in the ploughsoil and corrosion. 

The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part behind the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 4.30 mm deep at the stop ridge and the flange facets are approximately 3.13 mm deep, and is an elongated U shape in plan. The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete. The width at the butt is 24.12 mm, the butt has a thickness of 5.84 mm. The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two raised elements to haft the axe by. The facets on each side of the axe differ from one another. However, both faces of the axe have been severly damaged by abrasion and corrosion which renders comparison between the two faces difficult. The flange facets on both sides have been severly damaged, the edges are incomplete. 



The palstave measures 123.3 mm in length and has a width of 31.3 mm. It has a maximum thickness of 20.1 mm and weighs 297.7 g.



The palstave is a light - mid green colour with areas of thick well formed patina and exposed areas of abraded metal. It is likely that abrasion and corrosion has spread and affected over 75% of the surface of the axe. This corrosion seems to be relatively unstable at present and areas of light green active powdery corrosion can be observed. The majority of the abrasion present on the palstave is located on one face. There is an area of the original gold coloured patina on the surface on the base at the right hand side of the reverse. A similar example of this type of Palstave can be seen in Schmidt and Burgess (1981) plate 58, numbers 792 - 801, and has been identified as a Low Flanged Palstave. However it is difficult to be certain of this due to the exent of the corrosion on the surface of this object. This form and style of palstave fits into Group II or III (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981) which is dated to the Middle Bronze Age 1300-1200 BC.

786938,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1900,-1100,"A fragment of a copper-alloy axehead, Palstave or Flanged Type, of the Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1900 - BC 1100.



Only the tip of the blade and a small portion of the body of the axehead survive. No traces of a socket remain in the break of the axe, indicating that it is probably not a socketed axe from the later Bronze Age. The object is broadly D shaped in plan and rectangular in section. The blade is flares out from the sides of the object and is crescent shaped at the base. The sides of the object taper out to form a wide V shape. These both perhaps suggest that the axehead is either a flanged or palstave type. The cutting edge is highly abraded, and there is no evidence of a blade facet. The break is heavily patinated which would suggest that it is an ancient one and not the result of recent plough damage.



The incomplete axehead measures 29.3 mm long, 52.4 mm wide at the blade, and 37.7 mm wide at the broken end It has a thickness of 3.01 mm at the blade and is 9.2 mm thick at the broken end. It weighs 51.8 grams.



The object is a dark green in colour with an uneven patina. There are areas of lighter green corrosion, however it appears that the corrosion is stable. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.

787044,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1140,"An incomplete Bronze Age copper alloy barbed-and-tanged arrowhead or razer, dating circa 1275-1140 BC.



Other than the tang, the original perimeter of the arrowhead is heavily abraded or entirely missing. The present perimeter does, however, indicate that the sides were gently curved towards the tip, rather than being straight. A v-shaped notch separates the wings from the tang. The tang is rectangular in section, and measures 4mm x 1mm. A shallow midrib is visible on one side only. The midrib extends from the tang, being of the same width, and gently tapers towards the tip. The surface of the arrowhead is mid-brown and pitted, with patches of dark brown patina.



Length: 20mm, Width: 16mm, Thickness: 1.2mm, Weight: 1.79g.



There is only one bronze arrowhead from a secure Bronze Age context in Britain and that was in the Penard hoard, first reported in Archaeologica 71, page 138. The Penard arrowhead also has a mid rib. At the time of its discovery it was a unique find in Britain and was presumed to be an import as there are numerous finds of bronze arrowheads recorded from Northern France.



However, thanks to an increase in the number of reported metal detected finds, Bronze Age bronze arrowheads are now growing in number, though they remain a rare group of artefact. Dr Colin Pendleton reports that Suffolk has 17 known examples, of which 5 can be termed barbed and tanged. Norfolk has at least 4 recorded and more examples are being added to the database from around the country. This suggests that bronze arrowheads were also a British tradition.



Though the barbed and tanged form was used in flint from the Early Bronze Age to the Middle Bronze Age, the evidence from Penard, which dates from 1275-1140 BC, suggests that copper alloy arrowheads did not come into fashion until later in the Middle Bronze Age. Therefore this is the suggested date range for this arrowhead.



A similar arrowhead albeit with a mid rib rather than a mid ridge is WILT-6B6CD4. Also ESS-A41D75 is similar but only has a mid ridge on one side.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,1.79,,,1.2,20,1,Adam Daubney,Adam Daubney,,Nottinghamshire,Newark and Sherwood,Thorney,SK8572,From a paper map,53.23823588,-0.7278748,LIN-D95544,,Arrowhead.jpg,Bronze Age copper-alloy arrowhead,Lincolnshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/adaubney/Arrowhead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/568747.jpg
787086,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1150,-1000,"A hoard of 929 fragments of copper-alloy plate and their container of likely Late Bronze Age date, c. 1150 - 800BC, possibly of the Wilburton phase (c.1150-1000BC).



Description: The hoard consists of 929 fragments of copper-alloy 'plate'. These pieces range in size from 9mm x 6mm to 58mm x 41mm and are highly irregular. No element can clearly be identifed as coming from either a bun ingot, typical of the period or clearly definet object types. It is noted however that all the fragments are small enough to easily be added to a crucible for remelting. While most of the edges of the fragments appear to be breaks or relatively rough some 'natural' rounded edges are noted, likely from their inital produciton and thus suggest an orignal shape/size. All Fragments are patinated green and a number have fused together. The fragment sin total weighed 12559g.



These fragments were contianed within a medium sized hand made ceramic vessel, missing the rim and upper body (possibly because of plough truncation) and of an unidentified Bronze Age type. The ceramic fabric is of a silty-sandy matrix, with a fair fine flint temper and some larger sparser inclusions of irregular quartzite. The surface appears to have been finished in some manner reflecting possible smoothing on the inside. The upper section of the vessel appear to be relativelly thin and thickens substantial to the base. The diameter of the body of the pot is suggestee to be 210mm and survies to a height of 160mm.



Discussion:



The plates found at Preston show some similarities to another hoard recorded in Kent, the 2012 treasure case report and excavation at Lyminge (2012 T164). At Lyminge, amongst other LBA/Early Iron Age a total of around 380 copper alloy 'ingot plates' were found. Although at the time they lacked a parallel both in the immediate area and in continental Europe, we can note clear similarities between this hoard found at Preston and the case found at Lyminge. In both examples the plates appear in large numbers, they are of varying form and are suggestive of fracture or fragmentation as opposed to neat cutting. They are visually similar although the Lyminge pieces appear to be generally larger.



In regards the Lyminge hoard, the lack of similarity to existing forms of Bronze Age metalwork, differences in composition and the difficulty of dating the plates led to questioning of the Bronze Age date ultimately given. The secure placement of copper alloy pieces in a Bronze Age vessel at Preston strongly supports the assessment that these pieces reflect a Bronze Age date and use, possibly the same as that at Preston. Although no complete vessels were found at Lyminge, there were numerous pottery sherds likely contemporaneous with the plates. It is possible although not certain that the pieces may have been stored in these vessels as is the case at Preston.



While Lyminge is the most direct comparison we can draw to this hoard, there are several other sites which may possess similar examples of plate scrap, albeit in more limited forms and on a smaller scale. A treasure case (2014 T60) found near Bramfield in Suffolk for example possessed 28 copper-alloy fragments of plate-scrap 'ingot' of ""varying size and thickness"". While the pieces are identified as ingot fragments in the report, we can note far more similarity to the smaller pieces of plate found in this treasure case. The pieces of alloy are smaller than many ingots (all below 50mm) but are also crucially far thinner with depth generally between 2 and 5mm. The rectangular shape present on most of the pieces is also arguably similar to the treasure case in question. Similarly a treasure case hoard (2008T589) found at Broxted, Essex possessed a large and homogenous plate assemblage of 31 pieces. These pieces were more or less flat, they range in thickness from 2.5 to 6.3 millimetres and possessed an ""average thickness of 3.5 millimetres"". Although these plates are as a whole larger than those found in the Preston hoard and as such could show more similarity to Ingot, they still show some basic similarities. In this Essex treasure case several natural edges are present possessing curved outlines, something that can similarly be noted at the edges of the Preston hoard.



The unpublished Waldershare hoard from Dover Museum is possibly the most similar example. This hoard assemblage contained 341 fragments of bronze sword blades found in and around a flint tempered clay pot. While they have been identified as sword fragment (Weller, 2014), many of the pieces do not appear to reflect a traditional sword form and instead show similarities to the plate present in this treasure case. The presence of a vessel is also notable suggesting a connection between these two plate scrap hoards. Waldershare (Likely the general area of the hoard) is within 15 miles of both Lyminge and Preston and as such could represent links between the findspots.



Date and Wider context



The Late Bronze Age (LBA) has been generally noted as the most abundant period in terms of hoards with large numbers being deposited. Notably, very few of these assemblages in Kent contain obvious prestige items, instead the LBA as a whole contains a prevalence of ingots and cast waste (Weller, 2014). These pieces often found in founders hoards are widely interpreted as refuse material waiting to be recycled and used again (Br√ºck, 2002). The hoards are often extremely large with hundreds of pieces not uncommon.



This case fits well into such a pattern with the size of the pieces being supportive of their use in a crucible. The identification of other treasure cases containing potential pieces of plate scrap as Wilburton can assist with our assignment of this case to the LBA period. The pieces found with LBA material such as the axe at Lyminge may further support this assessment.



The ceramic vessel as noted suggests a range of dates, in both cases the LBA is mentioned as a possibility (1150 - 800 BC) and this is possibly in keeping with other plate scrap sites. The possibility it is either MBA (1500-1150 BC) or Early Iron Age (800-600 BC) can still be noted, however.



Nearby archaeological sites of interest show a range of archaeological features within 500m of the site. Neolithic activity in the North West is present but likely unrelated to this site. Iron Age settlement activity is also present, spreading to a ring ditch, finds of early Roman pottery in this area may suggest this may be too late in date although a long occupation is possible. A multi-phase Bronze Age settlement is also present to the immediate South West of the find as well as a Late Bronze Age axe hoard found within a mile. Whether these sites are related to the hoard is unclear but they can be noted as possible parts of a wider LBA or EIA landscape (Jackson & Ahmet, 2016).



Deposition 



Some inferences can be made from the total weight of the pieces, taken together they weigh over 12kg (12.559kg) and as such are potentially too heavy to be lifted in the pot in which they were contained. The weight is possibly suggestive that the pieces have been only placed in the vessel for deposition and were not being carried in it regularly. The weight also gives us some insight into the significant amount being removed from circulation, the need to store the volume of bronze for future use may explain the deposition in a single pot. The weight of the pieces shows few obvious parallels, the site of Sittingbourne is one clear example containing 13.6kg of amorphous tin-bronze fragments.



Conclusion 



The 929 pieces of plate metal and the ceramic vessel in which they were deposited represent a single find, all or part of which appears to have been deposited in a Bronze Age ceramic vessel. The metal fragments show clear similarities to several other later prehistoric cases in the area with the potential of sharing wider metallurgical activity with the site of Lyminge. Considering this evidence, the objects described above represent a single find of more than two base metal objects of prehistoric date, and therefore qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002)","We are grateful to Nigel Macpherson-Grant for his observations and thoughts on the ceramic vessel of this hoard.



Due to the substantial nature of this hoard and time restraints a sample of the fragments are photographed and shown here. Further pictures of the fragments and the container will hopefully be forthcoming.

787099,Adze,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"Middle Bronze Age bronze tool, probably an adze of Acton Park 2 or Taunton Metalworking Industries of Needham's (1996) Period 5 and probably dating to c. 1500 - 1300BC.



The axe is near-complete with peripheral damage but is heavily corroded and with a fragmentary butt (with a length of 164mm and a weight of 157.8g). The fractured butt has a rounded point and is thin (6mm wide and 2mm thick) but has suffered some erosion. The sides are moderately straight and divergent to the side protrusions or trunnions (giving the tool a width of 30.5mm). The corroded trunnions are rounded and of oval form (11mm long, 7mm wide and 3.0mm high). Below the trunnions, the sides of the blade are also straight and gently divergent before curving more sharply at the blade edge, although the blade tips are lost (with a surviving blade width of 34.5mm). The surface corrosion has mostly eradicated any casting seams, although there is the suggestion of a fettled seam on one side near the trunnion but no suggestion of a loop. The faces are of differing form, one is flanged, the other is ribbed and of chisel-like form. The flanged face has a median bevel (87mm from the blade where the adze has a thickness of 11.7mm) and short flanges, spanning the bevel (25mm long and 3.6mm high giving a maximum overall depth of 15.6mm). The blade is without any ribs and is flat across both its length and width and with no discernible blade facet. The other face is without flanges and the slightly domed curvature appears to incorporate the trunnions. There is the suggestion of a transverse moulding, running between the trunnions. The face has a prominent midrib, beginning well above the trunnions (35mm from the butt) and continuing along the blade (ending 26mm from the blade edge). The face is convex across its width but flat across its length, with no discernible blade facet. The surface is heavily-corroded and pitted. Remnants of the surface with a dark-green patina is preserved, largely on the septum of the flanged side.



The tool is unusual and difficult to closely parallel. The side trunnions and ribbed face can be broadly paralleled with 'Trunnion Tools', while the flanged face is best paralleled with flanged axes, perhaps closer to slender axes of Later Short-Flanged type. The tool may have been hafted with the handle abutting the flanged face and with binding over the ribbed face, rather than within a split handle, in the way flanged axes were secured. The method of hafting may imply the blade would be perpendicular to the axe direction suggesting the tool functioned as an adze. The tool may share similarities in form with 'palstave adzes', as published by Evans (1881, p. 85, gigs 70-1) and with recent examples recorded with PAS from Gisburn, Lancashire , Swithland, Leicestershire , Crosby Ravensworth, Cumbria , Brokenborough, Wiltshire and Tanworth-in-Arden, Warwickshire . It is tempting to see this example as a 'flanged-adze' predecessor of the palstave adze. Trunnion Tools have a long-lived production, spanning the Arreton Tradition at the end of the Early Bronze Age and continue into the Late Bronze Age (c. 1700- 800BC). If the flanged face is referencing and contemporary with axes of Later Short-Flanged type it is possible to suggest a date spanning Later Acton Park or Taunton metalworking, dating to perhaps c. 1500 - 1300BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-04-27T23:00:00Z,,,,157.8,15.6,,11.7,164,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Rhondda Cynon Taf,Llantrisant,ST0486,From a paper map,51.56467611,-3.386377,NMGW-DABBEA,,2015100.jpg,Middle Bronze Age 'flanged-adze',The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2015100.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/568831.jpg

The rapier is near-complete, with some damage to the shoulders and butt (with an overall length of 328mm and a weight of 94.3g). The butt end is arched and rounded (with a width of 20.3mm and a thickness of 1.6mm) with two side notches to accommodate rivets beneath (with a depth of 3.5mm and 2.8mm, giving a minimum width of 14.3mm at 10mm beneath the top of the butt). The shoulders are weak and poorly defined, with the butt widening very gradually and linearly to the shoulders (to reach a maximum width of 24.0mm, 27mm beneath the top of the butt, where the blade has a thickness of 4.1mm). The blade has a gentle curve beneath the shoulders to narrow slightly (to a width of 20mm). Below which, the blade is moderately straight and gradually convergent to the before narrowing more sharply at the tip. The blade has a flattened central section (8mm wide at the butt) which gradually narrows to a ridge at the tip. The blade edge is largely preserved and does not appear to have any contemporary nicks or blade edge damage. The upper half of the edge appears slightly wasted, possibly through use or sharpening. There are no sharpening striations now evident on the edge. The surface has a brown to black patina with some sandy encrustation, mostly on the lower half.



The blade profile would suggest a Group IV blade, the reduced butt may suggest Type Appleby and the rounded butt and rivet notches, would further refine the type to Variant Lakenheath, although illustrated examples with notches by Burgess and Gerloff (ibid.) are reworked. The poor definition of the shoulders together with the flat mid-section continuing above the notches may also indicate that the butt has been reworked. Very few Group IV rapiers had been recorded from Wales (from the 1981) study but a Type Appleby rapier was recovered from the Maentwrog Hoard (Gwynedd) with two other Group IV rapiers (Type Cutts, Variant Hampton Court and a blade with notched butt) and a basal looped spearhead. Burgess and Gerloff (1981, p 106) note that Group IV blades (without 'archaic' butts do not tend to be associated with Taunton metalwork and appear to start in Early Penard and Wallington, suggesting a date of c. 1300 - 1100BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,94.3,,,1.6,328,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Gwynedd,Gwynedd,Tudweiliog,SH2237,,52.90088368,-4.64791389,NMGW-DBE3D3,,20152531.jpg,Bronze Age rapier,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/20152531.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/568837.jpg

The anvil survives as a square body with two shanks from two of the straightish edges. Each shank is slightly pointed but very worn so full length is uncertain, each of the two 'blank' edges of the square body may be a break likely indicating further possible shanks or beaks but wear and patination obscures the detail. One maybe a V-Shaped working surface but it remains uncertain. One of these shanks may have been used to secure the anvil in wood and the other/s are likely to be a 'beak' designed for working metal into a curve. The surface of the anvil is mostly heavily pitted and a light green colour with an occasional small areas of smooth dark green.

788407,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2125,-1950,"Small cast copper alloy flat axe with a narrow butt end and a slightly flanged blade, dating from the Early Bronze Age. The butt end is 21 mm wide and 3 mm thick and the blade end is 52 mm wide and 3 mm thick, and the length of the whole axe is only 113.5 mm. The edge of the blade of the axe appears to be unused, and the size of the axe suggests that it might have been used for votive reasons. Analysing the content of the metal might help to confirm this, but it is from a private collection. The colour suggests that the axe is copper-rich and the original surface survives well, with small patches of corrosion product and a few pits, and a few marks on one face of the blade. Otherwise the axe is in very good condition. Flat axes with narrow butt ends with rectangular sections and slightly flanged blades can be found during the Brithdir metalwork phase (c.2150-2000 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 123, fig.24, no.34). Plain axes like this are also classified as Type Migdale which belong to 'Metalworking Assemblage III', corresponding to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 2 (c.2300-2050 BC).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar small flat axe from Patrington in plate 14, no.176, which is classified as a Type Migdale flat axe.

Below these, from the middle of the axe to the edge of the blade are six fanned ridges that have been hammered onto the axe after casting, and are about 60 mm in length, and about 8 mm apart. Below the decoration, the blade has been hammered and bevelled. The edge of the blade is damaged and parts of the surface are pitted with corrosion, but the dark green patina survives well and the axe has been treated and lacquered in the past so that it is now stable. Flat axes decorated with chevrons and with expanded blades can be found during the Mile Cross-Aylesford phase (c.2000-1900 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 4B axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 124, fig.25, no.46).

788409,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1875,-1725,"Cast copper alloy developed flat axe with a crescentic blade and the beginnings of a stop ridge, creating a slightly biconical profile, and dating from the Early Bronze Age. Both faces of the axe are decorated with multiple straight lines punched into the axe after casting, on average about 6 mm in length, and about 1 mm apart, in what is referred to as a 'rain pattern'. The decoration covers an area between the stop ridge, which is 70 mm from the edge of the blade, and about 20 mm from where the blade chamfers and angles down towards the cutting edge, which is about 18 mm in depth. The cutting edge is asymmetrically worn, suggesting extensive use, and the material displacement on one side represents damage from use (Matt Knight pers comm). The corners of the crescentic blade are at right angles to the side of the axe. The surface patina of the axe is good with little evidence of corrosion and the axe has been treated and lacquered and is now stable. Flat axes decorated with this 'rain pattern' and with crescentic blades can be found during the Willerby metalwork phase, dating from c.1875-1725 BC (Roberts et al, 2013, 23, fig.2.2) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 4 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 125, fig.26, no.53).

The axehead is broadly sub-rectangular in plan with an extended crescentic blade where the corners turn back on themselves. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The stop ridge is 4 mm thick and 20 mm wide and 62 mm from the butt end and 72 mm from the blade edge. There are thirteen oblique ridges on each side flange of the axe, which range in length up to 20 mm long and are each about 7 mm apart. There are some patches of green corrosion product but the surface of the axe has survived well and its general condition is very good. Flat axes with flanges decorated with oblique ridges and crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig. 28, no.87).

The socket mouth is 27 mm long and 17 mm wide, which is quite unusual. The collar is 10 mm deep with a side loop on one side of the axe, 5 mm below the collar. The side loop is 18 mm long with an aperture that is 6 mm in diameter. Above and below the side loop there is a casting seam which continues down the side of the axe and which is also on the other side, but has been chiselled flat, apart from a slight ridge above the side loop. There are minor facets down the sides of the blade faces. The blade has turned-up corners, so that the side edges of the blade are almost at right angles to the body of the axe. There are some patches of green corrosion product on the surface, but the axe has been treated in the past and is now stable. Socketed axes with rectangular socket mouths, plain collars and crescentic blades can be found during the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1275 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age. This axe shares similarities with the Taunton-Hademarschen axes, but also with the Type Meldreth axes with faceted bodies which date from the Wilburton metalwork phase (c.1150-1000 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The everted collar is 7 mm deep and about 10 mm below the everted collar is a transverse moulding, from which five parallel vertical ribs extend down the blade at right angles, on each face. Two of the longitudinal ribs form a border on either side where the axe is chamfered at a sharp angle. The ribs are 2 mm thick, 40 mm long and 6 mm apart. The side loop extends from the transverse moulding down the side of the axe to a length of 24 mm with an aperture that is 10 mm in diameter. The casting seam is evident above the side loop and above the transverse moulding on the other side of the axe, but the rest of the two seams that continue down the sides of the axe have been chiselled flat. The blade has slightly expanded corners, and the edge is undamaged, suggesting that the axe may not have been used. There are file marks on one face of the blade, where an area of corrosion has been filed away since its recovery, and it is away from the edge so that this is not a contemporary re-working of the blade, and the cutting edge has not been re-sharpened. Otherwise the axe is in very good condition with only a few patches of corrosion.



Socketed axes with sub-square socket mouths, everted collars and straight blades can be found during the Llyn Fawr metalwork phase (c.800-700 BC) of the Late Bronze Age into the Early Iron Age, such as the Sompting type socketed axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 138, fig.40, no.405).

The butt of the palstave is squared off and is 23 mm wide and 5 mm thick and expands on either side into flanges which protrude upwards at either side by 10 mm. The septum measures 17 mm wide and the stop is 72 mm down the length of the septum and 10 mm deep. There is a shield-shaped moulding with a curved base below the stop, measuring 23 mm in width and 30 mm in length down the blade. At either side of the axehead as the flange tops slope downwards after the stop, there is a transverse ridge that has been chiselled away after casting. The length of the blade from the end of the shield-shaped pattern to the edge of the blade facet measures 55 mm and the blade then slopes downwards to the cutting edge, which is 16 mm in depth. The blade splays outwards nearer the edge to form a semi-circular shape with one of the blade corners having been flattened since deposition, probably through damage. The cutting edge is still quite sharp and has been broadly hammered out initially, followed by finer hammering close to the edge, creating two bevels (Matt Knight pers comm). There is some corrosion on the blade and only patches of the dark green surface patina survive. The casting seam has been chiselled flat on either side of the axe and continues down the overall length of the flange and the blade side as a thin line. Palstaves with shield-shaped decoration and expanded blades can be found during the Acton Park II metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) of the Middle Bronze, such as the palstave illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 128, fig.29, no.92).

The side loop is 29 mm long and has an aperture that is 9 mm in diameter. The casting seam above the loop as been chiselled away, but there is still a raised lozenge-shaped lump, and the rest of the seam on both sides has been chiselled flat. The stop is 18 mm wide and 10 mm deep on both sides and the thickness of the flanges together, front and back, is 30 mm so the start of the blade beyond the stop is about 10 mm thick. The blade is 21 mm wide below the stop and expands into a crescent which is 63 mm wide and 2 mm thick at the cutting edge. The mid rib is 7 mm wide and 62 mm long, and is accentuated by two parallel grooves, one on either side of the rib, that are 5 mm wide and 62 mm long. There are multiple oblique scratches above the stop and between the flanges on one side, which have probably been caused by scraping old varnish or lacquer off the surface with something metallic, since its recovery and re-sale. Other than these, there are very few marks on the axe and little corrosion, and the blade is only damaged slightly at either corner, which has not happened through use, but more likely since deposition. Mid-ribbed palstaves with crescentic blades and side-loops can be found during the Taunton metalwork phase (c.1400-1275 BC) of the Middle Bronze Age, with broad crescentic cutting edges with tips at right angles to the blade, but the narrow body and low flanges rising to the stop ridge of this palstave are indicative of a transitional type which could date from the following Penard metalwork phase (c.1275-1125 BC) (Matt Knight pers comm).

791556,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Hoard of 16 Late Bronze Age copper alloy objects comprising of five socketed axes, three spearheads, two torc bracelets, four ring bracelets, two rings, one wood fragment possible part of a haft, hazelnut shells and 2 pressed flowers one of them complete deposited in some of the axes and the chisel. There were also in the same find spot 2 sherds of pottery both Roman, 1 fragment of vitrified glass one lithic implement probably a microlith. The Roman finds are invasive and therefore do not form part of the treasure case likewise the microlith is likely to be Mesolithic and residual. All were discovered together in a pit with large sub-rectangular sandstones some of which were utilised to weigh down the objects.



At the bottom of the pit were three spearheads all laid out in a line with two large heavy rings adjacent to the left. One of the socketed axes was between two sandstones. Then armrings and two wrist torcs were sandwiched between two socketed axe heads underneath and was another socketed axe head on top a socketed chisel.



Mixed in the soil of the deposition were a number of finds. A wood fragment was recovered measuring in length 52mm, with a width of 15mm, thicknessof 6mm and weighing 2.96g, it could relate to the hafting of one of the axes or spears. Also discovered with the deposition were two fragments of pottery one a creamy fabric with a shell temper measuring 30mm in length, 25mm in width, is 11mm thick and weighing 12.61g. The fabric is slightly soft with a powdery surface. It is an off-white colour and has a fine texture. The sherd was probably made at Mancetter, Warwickshire. Mortaria from Mancetter dates to the 2nd to 4th centuries (Tyers 1996). The sherd is slightly abraded and is only a fragment of the complete vessel. The other sherd measuring 39mm in length, 27mm in width, is 8mm thick and weighng 12.70g probably a sherd of Roman Black Burnished ware dating to the period c. AD 43 - 410. Possibly from a WA Type 20 ""dog-dish"" (Seagar-Smith 1993). The fabric is a black with a shell temper. Also discovered was a fragment of Roman vitirified glass measuring in length 20mm, width 8mm, thickness 4mm and weighing 2.0g. The glass is severely affected by extreme burning and is now vitrified. The fragment is irregularly shaped and exhibits a series of breaks. A further find of a lithic implement microlith was also discovered which is probably residual measuring in length, 11mm with a width of 4mm, thickness 2mm and weighing 0.19g. Probably a Mesolithic microlith barb of honey coloured flint dating to between c8000 amd c4000 BC. These finds are probably residual or invasive do not form part of this treasure case.



Also from the field but 40m away is a palstave axe previously found in 1990 now in Lancaster City Museum. The deposition appears to have been in the side of a large burnt mound around 10m in diameter. On the other side of the canal, a socketed axe is also on the database and a palstave 200m away on the same side of the canal as the deposition.



The metal artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Ewart Park phase, dating to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997).



The copper alloy artefacts within this hoard grouping are all of Late Bronze Age date with a combination of types represented indicating they were buried during the Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases, dating to between 1100-800BC (Needham et al 1997). It is intended to attempt to ascertain radiocarbon dates for the deposition of the hoard and undertake an investigation into the find spot.



‚Äã



1. Copper alloy socketed axe



The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, very chipped and jagged, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in recent and ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.



The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 28mm, internal length 32mm, external width 39mm, external length 42mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).



A moulded collar decorates the axe 8mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 31mm in length. The ribs are worn. The front and back faces of the axe are very slightly faceted at the socket end.



Along the centre of each side of the axe is a pronounced casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 14mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.



The axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125).



Axes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).



Length: 83mm, Width: 50mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 181.06g.



2. Copper alloy socketed axe



The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is crescentic, chipped and jagged in the centre although the rest of the blade is in good condition. The cutting edge measures 58mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.



The socket has a square mouth (internal width 26mm, internal length 26mm, external width 38mm, external length 38mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).



A moulded collar decorates the axe 22mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are two fluted ridges measuring 54mm in length.



Along the sides of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have not been filed down and are off centre to the left. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded side loop. The loop measures 14mm in width and 22mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam does not run over the side loop. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The axe closely resembles the Type Portree, variant Alford as identified by Schmidt and Burgess (1981, 188-190 and Plates 75 and 76).



Length: 90mm. Width: 59mm; blade: Thickness socket: 35mm and weight 260.64g.



3. Complete copper alloy spearhead



The spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.



Length: 152mm. Width: 44mm. Thickness socket: 24mm and the weight: 131.28g.



4. Cast copper alloy socketed axe complete and in good condition.



The axe is sub-rectangular in plan and the blade is gently flaring, chipped and jagged at the corners, with the cutting edge expanding outwards to form a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged and worn which occurred both in ancient times. The cutting edge measures 50mm in width and is 2.0mm thick.



The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 25mm, internal length 28mm, external width 37mm, external length 40mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).



A very worn moulded collar decorates the axe 15mm below the mouth on each face. Extending down from this are three raised ribs measuring 32mm in length. The ribs are worn.



Along the centre of each side of the axe is a casting seam. The seams have been filed down. One side of the axe has a semi-circular moulded very narrow side loop. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section. The casting seam runs over the side loop.



The axe most resembles Highfield and Fulford type socketed axes which tend to be rounded and more bag-shaped than later axes that were long, narrow and often had parallel sides (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 181ff; Plate 72-73; 125). Axes of Type Fulford are part of the Wallington/Wilburton metalwork assemblages and typically show Irish influence in their multiple collar mouldings (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 177-178). They are normally found in Northern Britain and the closest parallel to the object was found at Low Fell in the Langdales, Cumbria (Schmidt and Burgess, 1981, no. 1003). The axe also bears comparison with Eogan's (2000) Class 8D form, with similar mouldings on axes of variant Westow (see ibid., nos. 1127, 1231, 1242 & 1251).



A fragment of a pressed flower was discovered in the bottom of the socket presumably for attachment. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



Length: 86mm; the blade width is 50mm. Thickness socket: 26mm and the weight is 219.14g.



5. Copper alloy socketed chisel or unlooped socketed axe



The socket has a sub square mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 25mm, external width 28mm, external length 32mm and the wall of the mouth is 5mm thick).



On the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away and are almost invisible. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The blade is crescentic in good condition. The cutting edge measures 54mm in width and is 1.0mm thick. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (57mm wide) which appear to have been deliberately recessed.



The socketed axe is unlooped, making it highly unusual and very rare. There are no comparable axes in the corpus of axes covering northern Britain by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) and neither are there comparable socketed chisels in the corpus of woodworking tools in southern England by Lee (2014). However, Eogan (2000, 215-16 and Plate 111) highlights the few examples found in Ireland with one parallel with the provenance only of ""County Armagh"" being the closest (No. U15).



Length: 110mm, Width: 53mm, Thickness socket: 25mm, Weight: 152.07g



6.Copper alloy spearhead



The spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in fine condition with blades still sharp and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 106-113 and Plates 67-72) as Group 11: Generic Type 11C Leaf Shaped blade.



Length: 150mm. Width: 43mm; Thickness socket: 20mm and weight 130.79g.



7. Complete copper alloy axe



The socketed axe is slender and faceted in form with a collar, relatively narrow sides, which taper slightly and then expand to form a sub-triangular shaped blade. The mouth of the axe is sub-circular in cross section. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The socket has a sub circular mouth (internal width 21mm, internal length 24mm, external width 29mm, external length 31mm and the wall of the mouth is 6mm thick).



The mouth of the axe tapers and the loop is relatively small in a low position set well beneath the collar. Directly above the loop is a cast decorative circumferential ridge and above this on one face of the axe is a peg hole 4mm in diameter there may have been another on the other face but this area is covered with corrosion. The loop measures 9mm in width and 15mm in length. It is D-shaped in cross-section.



On the corners (between the sides and the faces) there are recessed body angles, these extend from the lower mouth moulding and taper towards the outer corners of the cutting edge. This pattern is repeated on all four 'corners'. The lower body of the axe could be described as faceted, with six faces; however, the facets are relatively low and slight. The cutting edge has a pronounce flare out toward each of the blade tips (50mm wide). The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been filed away bur is still visible on and at the base of the side loop. The cutting edge is crescent shaped edge and regular suggesting little evidence of wear / sustained use. Apart from the groove below the collar there is no evidence of other ornamentation on the axe.



Inside the axe a complete pressed flower was inserted possibly a type of thistle.



Length: 97mm. Width: 52mm; blade: Thickness socket: 24mm and weight 148.01g.



The socketed axe can be classified as Type Meldreth (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204-211 and Plate 82). It is closely comparable to axes found singly at Knotty Ash, Lancashire (No. 1226), Newham, Northumberland (No. 1227) and Pendle Hill, Lancashire (No. 1229).



8. Copper alloy penannular bracelet



The bracelet has expanded oval-shaped terminals. The body is broken in one place. The surface has a green patina.



There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).



Diameter: 60mm. Thickness: 8mm. Terminals diameter: 9mm and weight 20.33g.



9. Copper alloy penannular bracelet



The penannular bracelet has two expanded oval-shaped terminals. It is in two fragments with one fragment missing that would have joined the terminal fragment to the body of the bracelet. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy bracelets though this form is paralleled in copper alloy bracelets found in Glentanar, Aberdeenshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 143, no. 12) and Auchtertyre, Morayshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 144, nos. 7, 10 and 11).



Diameter: 54mm. Thickness: 4mm. Terminals length 5mm, width 2mm and weight 6.89g.



10. Copper alloy spearhead



The spearhead is plain pegged with a leaf-shaped blade, extending from just above the two peg-holes (c.6mm in diameter) with a chamfered edge and pronounced central mid-rib which extends all the way to the tip. The line of the blade is smoothly it curves and angles a little more sharply at the tip. The spearhead is in 3 fragments and it has an oval socket which still contains remains of the wooden shaft. The patina is brown/orange with a smooth surface.



The spearhead can be classified within the typological scheme outline by Davis (2015, 116-123 and Plates 75-77) as Group 11: Generic Type 11E Short, splayed socket.



Length: 123mm. Width: 46mm; blade: Thickness socket: 23mm and weight 91.86g.



11. Copper alloy annular armring



The annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. This armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.



There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).



Diameter: 90mm. Thickness: 3mm; and weight 15.79 g.



12. Copper alloy annular armring



The annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. The armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.



There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).



Diameter: 67mm. Thickness: 3mm; and weight 13.99g.



13. Copper alloy annular ring



The annular ring is circular in shape and has a lozenge-shaped cross section. There are three defined circumferential ridges running parallel around one section of the ring.

15. Copper alloy annular armring



A complete copper alloy annular armring, broken into 4 fragments post-deposition. It is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod. The armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.



There is currently no standard typology for Late Bronze Age copper alloy armrings though this form is paralleled in copper alloy armrings found at Balmashanner, Forfar, Angus (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 152, nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57).



Diameter: 87mm. Thickness: 4mm; and weight14.29 g.



16. Complete copper alloy annular armring



The annular armring is sub-oval in plan and sub-circular in section with flattened internal and external edges. The arming appears to be formed from a solid copper alloy rod as a visible attachment seam is retained, which is uneven. Small linear file marks are visible on the flattened surface near to the join, with a few smaller marks on the opposing flattened side. The armring has a mid-dark brown copper colour with patches of green corrosion product, but appears in good condition overall.

17. Wood fragment, hazel nut shells and a pressed flower



Discovered within the deposition they relate to deposition containers and possibly the hafting of one of the axes or spears.



Length: 52mm. Width 15mm: Thickness 6mm and the weight 2.96g.



The insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard, Suffolk (PAS SF-BDA986) is comparable to the to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park metalwork phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).



Discussion



With the exception of the 2 Roman ceramic sherds, the vitrified glass and the flint microlith, which is probably of an earlier Mesolithic date, the objects listed above belong to a single deposit, dating to the Late Bronze Age (Wilburton-Ewart Park metalwork phases c. 1100-800 BC) and, on the balance of probabilities, should be treated as a single find of more than two objects of prehistoric copper alloy. Whilst all of the individual object types have been found in northern Britain, it is the quantity and diversity of objects in the Late Bronze Age hoard from Scotforth, Lancashire makes it a distinctive and rare discovery. The insertion of objects into the sockets of socketed axes is a common practice in hoards of this period. It is however extremely rare, if not unique, to discover inserted pressed flowers. Hoards of this size are, however, still relatively rare in Northern England and there are no comparable finds from Lancashire or Cumbria currently known. Gold objects deposited in a copper alloy socketed axe's socket have been recorded in other hoards, and the 'Near North Cove' hoard is comparable to the Late Bronze Age hoard from 'Trevalyn Farm', where four gold bracelet fragments were discovered within the socket of a faceted axe of Type Meldreth, belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt 2005).



Conclusion



Consequently, these finds qualify as Treasure under the 2002 Amendment to the Treasure Act of 1996 (Category 2), which stipulates that any group of two or more metallic objects of any composition of any prehistoric date that come from the same find and found after 1 January 2003, qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act.

It has flanged parallel sides, the butt end is squared off, with rounded corners, and there is a crescent shaped blade with upturned corners. There is a very shallow stop ridge, now difficult to discern. In side elevation the septum and flanges are in the form of a very slender oval and the outer sides of the flanges are decorated with a moulded, diagonal, ropework pattern that is a characteristic of the Arreton phase. Other than some abrasion around the butt end and some surface chips on one side of the septum and one flange, the axe is in very good condition with a smooth, dark green patina.

The object is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is missing due to an old and abraded break however the retained portion tapers inward toward the butt end. The retained portion of the body of the object has a diagonal break, possibly cause post-depositionally.   



The metal is brown in colour with areas of light green corrosion. The object has a pitted patina.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.

Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The upper face of the ingot is smooth with some dark green patches of patina, and coppery red areas of decay, and light green powdering which is bronze disease. The sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

This fragment cannot be part of an axe blade or a razor blade as they taper towards the curved cutting edge and not towards the broken inner edge. It may look very like an axe blade fragment in plan, but the profile shows that it is not. But the cutting edge is missing so that any identification cannot be proven.



See NMS-0B76C3 for a similar sickle blade fragment, which is dated from the Late Bronze Age, and has worn as this piece has to create a skin-like patina layer, with lighter green corroded edges.

The axe is an elongated triangle, with rounded terminals. In profile the butt is tapers in thickness towards its edge. The thickest portion, in profile, is the point between the blade and butt. The blade, in profile tapers to a blunt, rounded edge. The axe is slightly asymmetrical in the centre and at the blade edge.



The surface of the axe has a well-developed light green-brown coloured patina.



The axe measures 48.05mm in length, 21.24mm in width, 6.95mm thickness and weighs 24.0g.



The date of the axe is not certain. Flat axes initially date to the early Bronze Age, c. 2000 to 1600 BC, but do tend to be larger and have a facetted edge if it were used, for example WAW-049216. It is possibly this example is a model or miniature axe as the blade does not appear to be functional, unless it has been over used. Votive axes are known from the Roman period, such as DOR-8BF889. The surface condition may suggest the axe is dating to the Bronze Age rather than the Roman period, but as it is not certain a wide date range will be given.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2015-05-09T23:00:00Z,2015-05-09T23:00:00Z,,,24,,,6.95,48.05,1,Angie Bolton,Carina Hughes,East Midlands,Leicestershire,North West Leicestershire,Ellistown and Battleflat,SK4311,From finder,52.6949811,-1.36519162,WAW-E3F2D5,,WAWE3F2D5.jpg,"Bronze Age to Roman flat axe (plan, profile and reverse).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWE3F2D5.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/590999.jpg

The axe has a clean break parallel with the blade and 4.5 cm above the tip of the blade.



There is a darker area of casting in the centre of the break which may be indicative of the bottom of the socket having been just above that break. Perhaps it may also be due to some form of deferential cooling of the core. It may be possibility that it is a fragment from an earlier form of palstave axe.

795779,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-800,-700,"Late Bronze Age date (c. 800 - 700 BC) socketed hammer: The cast copper alloy hammer has a rectangular mouth on the interior edge of the socket, but the exterior edge is a sub-oval. The upper edge of the mouth is damaged and incomplete, but the damage is not recent as the patina matches the side faces. The mouth, on the exterior, has a high-relief lip and high-relief band below the lip. Co-joined to the band along the edge there is a high-relief elongated triangle platform as decoration on each wide face. The interior of the mouth measures 10.96mm long and 7.73mm wide and the socket is 26.82mm deep. There is no residual material present inside the socket and the socket is slightly angled compared to the exterior edge of the mouth. The hammer, when viewed in plan, is rectangular below the band, and towards the terminal flares outwards slightly, is also slightly obliquely angled through use and is slightly convex. This terminal, when viewed from the base, is rectangular with rounded terminals. Along the sides there is a trace of a casting seam along the length of the hammer but some finishing has occurred as the seam is rounded. The surface of the hammer has an incomplete mid brown matte patina which has a slight shiny greyness to it where it has been more recently scuffed, otherwise it is abraded.



The hammer measures 51.95mm in length, 23.11mm in width, 19.34mm thickness and weighs 84.3g.



Hammers often have a higher tin content in the bronze (Evans; 1881) compared to contemporary axes. It has not been possible to metallurgically analyse this example but on the record for NMGW-475C27, a comparable example in dimensions and weight to this hammer, the recorder comments the weight may suggest a high proportion of lead, rather than tin.



The Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website (https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/hammers) comments that the ""socketed hammer is only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976: 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA' With regard to decoration, they are found with or without a single rib band, and in the case of a few hoards in Britanny, some hammers were found with chevron decoration."" Another example on the PAS database with decoration to this example is NMGW-475C27.



The YORYM-ABCCE1 record for another hammer discusses the dating of socketed hammers stating that 'early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding'. With this in mind and the potential high proportion of lead, the Worcestershire hammer probably dates to the Late Bronze Age possibly dating to the Ewart-Park Phase (c. 800 - 700 BC), a phase characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts.



Bronze Age socketed hammers are not frequently reported, with just over 40 certain examples recorded on the PAS database at the time of writing (August 2016), including CAM-5B410A, SOM-B048D1, YORYM-86F1B4, DEV-A7DFBD, SF-40FAAD, YORYM-ABCCE1, FAKL-9C9543, LVPL-5A7954, SWYOR-D13642, NMGW-475C27, LVPL766, LVPL1167, NMS1243, SF-2CF092, LVPL-89D1D3, LVPL-89D1D3, LVPL-5A7954, LVPL-5A6D83, IOW-A05DE6, HAMP-8CB626, NARC-F543D2, HAMP-2CB8E2, NMS-23EF85, SUSS-2D5992, SF-50F922, NMS-4D3FD2, LANCUM-2C7E41, HAMP-1F3730, BH-5A09F0, SF-86C4F5, IOW-8B13A7, SF-B89096, WAW-75FD95, NMGW-46A3A3, SF-F4C804, SOM-9AAFF3, LON-80850F, NMS-9B7964, NMS-03BA13, IOW-B9E2E2, and KENT-FDBC44.



This hammer and WAW-75FD95 are the only two examples on the PAS database from the West Midlands at the time of writing. The distribution for these axes on the PAS database tend to be below a line stretching from the north Norfolk coast across to St.David's in Wales and above a line stretching through Crewe to Hull. There is a narrow band across the Midlands which is, at the moment, devoid of these hammers on the database.

795784,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-800,"Bronze Age (c. 950 to 800 BC) socketed axe: The blade portion of the copper alloy axe remains with the broken edge traversing the axe revealing a short portion of the socket. The blade has straight sides and only slightly flared blade tips. The cutting edge is blunt, and is slightly convex. The casting seam is visible on the sides, forming a slight triangular profile. One face of the axe has three parallel ribs visible, the other face has traces of these ribs, but they are not as clear. The socket is rectangular with rounded corners, but is off-centre therefore making the wall on one face very thin.



The surface of the axe has been over cleaned and has what are through to be recent scratches across the surface. There are two small patches of a heavy dark brown coloured patina, whereas the remaining surface is a mottled mid to dark green and brown colour. Despite the over-cleaning the axe is in a stable condition.



The axe measures 48.38mm in length, 41.79mm in width and 16.05mm at the thickest point, and weighs 93.5g.



The axe dates to the Ewart Park phase, and, due to the three parallel ribs extending to the blade face, is possibly a South Welsh or South Western type dating to c. 950 - 800 BC. Similarly decorated axes are illustrated in Savory (1980, Figure 25).

In section the spearhead is has a sub-circular tube with short, abraded triangular facets, one on opposite sides which are the abraded blades. The tip is missing and here the spear is a sub-square in section. The spearhead fragment is broadly sub-triangular in plan. The lower portion of the spearhead has been lost and the break is too high to include the cast side loops. The break at the base of the spearhead includes the top of the socket which is circular. The break at this point is not recent. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has traces of a dark green patina, otherwise the surface is pitted and heavily abraded. 



The spearhead measures 42.78mm in length, 6.40mm in width, and weighs 7.8g.



It is likely that the spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150BC). However, many of the diagnostic characteristics (such as loops, peg holes and blade shape) have been lost and so a wider date range is suggested above.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,1943-12-31T23:00:00Z,1985-12-31T00:00:00Z,,,7.8,,,,42.78,1,Angie Bolton,Carina Hughes,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Wychavon,Beckford,SO9737,From finder,52.0314004,-2.04514052,WAW-76615B,,WAW76615B.jpg,"Bronze Age spearhead (plan, plan and terminals).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW76615B.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/586017.jpg

On the exterior surface there is a trace of a side loop, the loop on the other side is completely missing. There is a fragment of the blade on either side of the socket, but the upper edge is broken, and this break is not recent, but the surface of the break does not have the same patina as the outer surface of the spear. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The surface of the spearhead has a dark shiny brown coloured patina.
