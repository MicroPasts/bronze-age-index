256239,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-2000,-1700,"Cast bronze (copper alloy) decorated developed flat axe of early Bronze Age date (2000-1700BC). The axe is relatively small but is complete with very little wear to the butt end. The blade is much worn and also much sharpened creating a distinct curved blade. The lower body / blade of the axe is decorated with punched pellets. This axe best fits into Developed Flat Axe typology, specifically Type: Bandon. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC.  The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed and worn crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is sub-rectangular with very slight raised edges / side flanges (H shaped). The overall length is 78.0mm and the axe weighs 43.71 grams. The butt is slight and narrow with a distinct D shaped rounded end. It is also relatively thin (1.0mm thickness, width 11.6mm). The long sides (edges) of the axe are relatively straight and expanding from the butt to the base of the blade. The edges of the axe have been raised slightly, probably by hammering rather than casting, to form very slight flanges. It should be noted that where there are raised flanges on both faces there is a distinct groove on the inner face of the axe again suggesting that they have been raised by hammering. At the mid point of the axe a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This is lightly to have been cast and augmented by hammering; small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces of the axe where the metal has been worked to augment them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, but acts as a distinct division between the butt and lower blade of the axe. The width of the axe at the median bevel is 17.9mm (thickness 5.7mm). Below the bevel the sides continue to expand.   The area between the median ridge and junction with the blade is decorated on both faces of the axe. The design on both is broadly identical being contained by the median bevel and another raised bevel at the top of the blade. This lower bevel echoes the shape of the blade being broadly crescentic and probably parallel to the original shape of the cutting edge. The decoration consists of a series of panels formed from lines of incised pellets. Both the median bevel and lower bevel each have two slightly crescent shaped parallel lines forming a distinct border across the axe, the two long sides each have a similar single line of pellets respecting their expanding edge. This forms a central sub rectangular area which is further sub-divided by two rectangles, aligned along the length of the axe, each made up with incised pellets. There is also some evidence of further decoration continuing on the septum / in the groove formed by raising the side facets. This consists of a single line of pellets on each long side terminating at approximately ½ the length of the butt. These pellets are indistinct and slightly obscured in places by abrasion. Beneath the decorated area and raised ridge the sides of the blade expand to produce an irregular, worn, crescentic blade edge with a maximum width of 29.5mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. However it is likely that the axe had been heavily worn and used prior to deposition, with the blade shape being distorted by repeated use. A distinct blade facet is not present.  The side of the axe are relatively uniform and there is no evidence of a cast seam. The upper edge of one side of the axe seems to have been decorated possibly with a cable like decoration, being formed from parallel diagonal facets. However, this is less clear on the other lower edge of the axe.    The axe is a mid green colour with a highly polished but abraded patina, which has been damaged in areas. Where this had occurred it is probably as a direct result of movement in the plough soil. This abrasion is most evident of the blade of the axe. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident.   The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL. BC. This axe is very similar to a number of decorated examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge ... Decoration, often rich and complex, is characteristic of Irish examples in particular (p65.) A good comparison to the style of decoration can be seen in axes 347 and 359, although direct parallel of decoration is not recorded",Found during the Weekend Wanderers Lattin Down Rally 6-7 September 2008,4,,,,Metal detector,,,,,43.7,,,5.7,78,1,Peter Reavill,Peter Reavill,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Wantage,SU4084,,51.55347551,-1.42447023,HESH-D95656,,HESH-D95656 detail 7.jpg,Early Bronze Age: decorated developed flat axe,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/preavill/HESH-D95656 detail 7.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/224569.jpg

The spearhead is complete, the blade and socket undamaged with a smooth green patina showing hardly any sign of decay. The head is leaf-shaped and the socket has a fairly pronounced midrib. The tip of the spearhead very thin being the same thickness as the socket at its widest point and there are very fine, very clear re-sharpening marks all around the edges of the wings, running parallel to it. The socket is has a wide diameter compared to the overall size of the spearhead and the loops, which are flattened, are situated roughly one third of the way along the shaft.



There is some hatched decoration along the sides of the socket where the casting seams had been smoothed down. Side-looped spearheads are categorised by Greenwell and Brewis' as Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal.

259951,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-800,-600,"This find is of a particularly good example of a late Bronze Age socketed axe in the tradition of the Llyn Fawr phase (800 - 600BC). The axe has a long, elegant form, with a single mouth moulding, now partly missing, and a well defined loop (external width - 20.69mm, internal - 6.18mm), formed just below the lip. There are no design mouldings to the faces of the axe but they are slightly convex in form. The mouth is near circular and the internal moulding replicates the exterior form, excluding the blade tips, to a depth of 85mm, with no mould lines. The sides of the axe have clear moulding seams that have been in part, hammer finished with the exception of the seam on the loop. The loop also has what might be a casting flash to its lower edge. The blade is slightly flanged with a cutting edge, measured from the intact half of 56mm and a width of 47mm. The flange would appear to be accomplished in the mould with no signs of further hammering to extend the tips. One tip is now missing and the cutting edge is largely corroded away. There is perhaps evidence of sharpening, as the blade tip has many fine transverse scratch marks across the width of the cutting edge. That the blade has been used is confirmed by a great many longitudinal/part diagonal scratches and gouges covering most of the blade surfaces. On one face, there is a large gouge near centre of the face and starting just under half way up and running to the mouth moulding. That gouge would appear to be consistent with use as it starts fine and narrow and expands in width and depth as it travels up the face. It is possible that it was responsible for the eventual damage to the mouth moulding. The surface shows sporadic outburst of corrosion but for the greater part, it has a fine polished dark brown patina.","The Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections (NMW) Fig 46-5 (P194) has a similar axe with a slight variation to the mouth moulding, from the Llynfawr Hoard.",4,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2009-05-25T23:00:00Z,,,,173.8,,31.41,,120,1,Rod Trevaskus,Rod Trevaskus,Wales,Wrexham,Wrexham,Holt,SJ3752,GPS (from the finder),53.061515,-2.941524,CPAT-357295,,2873-0002.jpg,Bronze Age - Llyn Fawr - Socketed Axe,Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/2873-0002.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/213967.jpg

271518,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-300,"Incomplete Middle Bronze Age to Early Iron Age bronze 'half-moustache'-like object with damage at both ends. It measures 36.24x9.87x9.84mm and weighs 10.74g. 

The object resembles half a moustache and consists of one solid pointed drop-shape. It is uncertain if it was originally a single half (as these are known) or one half of an original whole which would have been joined to the second half by a (probably perforated) central area.

At the wider end (9.87x9.84mm) the jagged (old) break stands 3.6mm proud of the solid object, suggesting the end would have been hollow, perhaps for attachment purposes. This half of the 'half moustache' is decorated with longitudinal pronounced ridges and deep grooves (twenty ridges) which encircle the outside edge whilst the object itself narrows and thins to 7.33x9.18mm. On the underside three ridges there are obscured slightly by a smoother patch of copper alloy, apparently over the top of the ridges. 

Beyond this the object tapers more dramatically to an (old) break 4.07x4.64mm. This half is plain, if badly pitted through loss of patina.

These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). Three other examples are known besides the twelve recorded on the PAS database. Some of these are single examples, while others are 'double' sometimes with a central perforation. This suggests the object was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.

273467,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,2200,1900,"This is a fragment of an Early Bronze Age flat axe.  In this case, the axe has lost most of the lower blade and cutting edge but the shape and overall characteristics, give credibility to the conclusion.











The butt is rounded, slightly bent and coincident with the bend, there is a stress fracture across the face around one centimetre from the top edge.  A small section of the butt has broken away and missing.  The surface is undecorated but there are what appear to be hammer strikes down the edges.  The axe width expands from the butt with a very slight concave curve towards the now missing blade section.  The remaining length is 81.5mm and maximum width 47.5mm.  The thickness runs from 6.92mm at the butt to 4.90mm at the remaining lower edge at the break.











Found in Shropshire near the border with Wales, it resembles the matrices carved on the five-matrix axe mould from the river bed of the Walleybourne below Longden Common which has been ascribed to the Migdale-Marnoch tradition. See Thomas, Nicolas, ""An Early Bronze Age Stone Axe-Mould from the Walleybourne below Longden Common, Shropshire"" in Prehistoric Man in Wales and the West, 1972, pp161-6. It is also similar to axeheads found at Usk, Monmouthsire and St George's, Glamorgan (Savory, H N, 1980. ""National Museum of Wales, Guide Catalogue of the Bronze Age Collections"", pp165, Fig. 17, nos 106 and 110).  Staff at the National Museum have now confirmed the this axe belongs to the Migdale Tradition.











The surface has a small area of ancient, brown bronze patina but the greater part is lost.  That patina has now broken away to reveal the corrosive bright green copper oxidation below.","METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF A FLAT AXE FRAGMENT FROM SHROPSHIRE


 ANALYSIS by Mary Davis[1]


TECHNIQUE


Analysis to ascertain the elemental composition of the artefact was carried out using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The axe was examined whole within the specimen chamber and was analysed for 100 live seconds using a working distance of 35mm and an accelerating voltage of 20kV. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from under the surface corrosion were analysed; this occurred when the object was excavated. Apart from very superficial surface swabbing of the artefact there was usually no further sample preparation. The result presented is semi-quantitative. Overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion.


 


Three separate readings were taken from the axe and the overall totals acquired were relatively low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analysis comparable with other results.


 


RESULT


Bronze


Average composition of metal


84-88% copper


1-2% arsenic


11-13% tin


 


COMMENT by Adam Gwilt[2]


This is the butt end of an early axe with a narrow butt and concave flaring sides. The identification of this as being bronze in composition, rather than copper, helps to identify this axe as of Type Migdale, belonging to the early part of the Early Bronze Age and dating to between 2200-1900BC. However, the relatively thick butt is atypical for the type, generally defined as having a tapering butt. This fragment probably belonged to a large and heavy flaring axe, showing close affinity with many similar axes known from Scotland. It is likely to be British rather than an Irish product. In Wales, two hoards containing Migdale axes are known, from Brithdir, Caerphilly and Oxwich, Swansea, while a mould for a Migdale axe has been found at Betws-y-Coed, Conwy. Only around 30 examples of Migdale axes are currently known from Wales, while Dr Peter Northover only lists an additional six examples from the Welsh Marches in his recent study of bronzes from Wales and The Marches. This artefact, though fragmentary, therefore has some importance for the wider understanding of the early use and deposition of bronze in the region. It merits careful recording, illustration and photography to ensure it may be included within a wider future synthesis of material from the early part of the Early Bronze Age.

273872,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-700,"Late Bronze Age (1000 – 700 BC) cast bronze faceted Socketed Axehead of type Gillespie, sometimes known as ‘baggy axe’. It measures 83.62mm in length and weighs 213.39g.

The axe has a faceted, short, broad and baggy body with a gentle curve at the sides extending into a flared trumpet shaped mouth at one end and expanded cutting edge at the other. Both cutting edge and mouth are of similar width, making the axehead rather symmetrical.

The mouth is circular in shape and measures c.43mm in diameter. It has a deep flaring collar which has a moulded rim at the edge. The socket is rather more oval in shape, measuring 32.8x29.61mm. It is 67mm deep.

The loop projects just beneath the flaring collar, where the body measures 37x34mm. From here, the sides drop with a very gentle curve to the expanded cutting edge, 48.97mm wide. The facets extend inwards of the edge in a deep curve, which straightens to a vertical roughly half way along the body of the axe.

The surface is extremely pitted though the patina is preserved in some areas, notably the cutting edge which has obviously had additional work in its lifetime. The casting flashes around the loop have been smoothed but area still visible, unlike the join on the other side where they are not visible. There also appear to be casting flashes around the mouth moulding (possibly an additional, thinner moulding below that of the open end) but this seems unfinished, or else obscured by pitting.

The inside of the socket shows two prominent ribs from the corresponding grooves of the core.

This axe is of a type which is known as Type Gillespie, which Burgess and Schmidt suggest is associated with later Wilburton metalworking traditions and Ewart Park tradition. It has been suggested that this form of facet axe continues production into the Llyn Fawr tradition (which is the transitional period between the metalwork of the Bronze and Iron Ages).

Length 108.7mm, Width 27.8mm, Thickness 23.9mm, Weight 168g. This palstave has the stop-ridge fused to small flanges to form a pocket on each face of the tool which split or folked ends of the wooden handle could be attached. There was a single loop now missing added onto the lower surface of the axe to enable it to be fastened more securely to the haft. This has broken away in antiquity. Possibly resulting in the loss of the axe. This palstave has a plain blade of narrow shape with a fine casting seam. Approximately 70% of the axe has an olive green patina but there is surface corrosion on the rest with loss of the end of the butt and possibly some of the cutting edge of the blade. Ref.

279925,Axe,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1000,-800,"A cast bronze faceted socketed axehead. The mouth of the socket, in the interior, is almost circular in plan and measures 29.8mm diameter. The exterior has a single prominent moulded ridge around the mouth rim. Below the rim there is a more feint ridge which is sited just above the side loop. On one side there is an integral loop which is semi-circular in plan and a sub-lozenge in section. Extending from the more feint moulded ridge there are multiple ribs on both faces, five on one face and seven on the other. In plan the axe has slightly concave sides with a slight flaring at the blade. The blade is heavily abraded and the original edge is now lost. The sides of the axe form a shallow ‘<’ shape in section with a casting seam at the apex. The side casting seams have been smoothed slightly, but are still visible. When these seams extend to the mouth rim, the seams have been smoothed to become almost flat. Approximately half of the socket is filled with what appears to be soil rather than organic remains. The socket has been recently cleaned. The surface of the axe has a shiny mid blue/green patina covering the majority of the axe, otherwise there are areas of abrasion and corrosion. There are slight traces of a shiny grey surface on the axe as well. The axe measures 114.04mm in length, 45.22mm wide across the apex of the loop and upper portion of the axe, and is 40.74mm thick across the mouth rim.

280188,Winged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-875,-800,"Late Bronze Age bronze end-winged axe, belonging to the Carp's Tongue complex of Ewart Park metalworking, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 7 and dated to c. 950-750BC.



The winged axe is incomplete, missing both wings on the unlooped side (the axe has an overall length of 1360.9mm and a weight of 282.8g). The butt protrudes beyond the return of the wings (by 14mm) and expands to the end (with a width of 22.4mm and a thickness of 6.1mm). The end of the butt has two 'horns' each side of a central rectangular break, which would have been attached to the casting jet before removal. The sides of the axe are straight and converge slightly towards the start of the blade (where the axe has a maximum body width behind the loop of 27mm and a minimum width at the stop of 21.8mm). The loop is positioned towards the rear of the wings (and has a length of 20.7mm, a height of 8.7mm, giving the axe an overall width of 34.6mm, a thickness of 6mm and an aperture of 7.4mm x 5.3mm). The remains of the casting seams are discernible along both sides. The wings diverge sharply to their apices before returning more gradually to the blade. The wings are only partially turned-over and were unlikely to have been closed (the wings have a maximum height of 36.4mm, a length of 48.7mm and a thickness of 4.7mm). Both the wings on the unlooped side have broken in antiquity (with a surviving height of 23mm) a stress fracture near the blade appears to suggest the wing was struck from the top (as hafted). The stop is rounded and gradually slopes from the septum (where the axe has a maximum body thickness of 18.0mm). The blade is slender and the sides diverge to form a rounded blade edge (with a width of 40.3mm). The blade faces are slightly convex with no discernible blade facet. The original surface of the axe has been lost and has a current pitted bronze surface. The septum has small patches of black patina surviving.



End-winged axes are associated with the Carp's Tongue complex with a distribution centred around northern France and southern Britain. Burgess's (1968) distribution of the axe type is confined to south-eastern England except for one western outlier in St. Kenidjack, Cornwall. Swansea Museum has a (probable) replica end-winged axe recovered from Sketty, Swansea. A Ewart Park hoard recovered in 2005 from Llancarfan, Vale of Glamorgan contained one end-winged axe (Gwilt, 2008, p 221, no. 1223) . This discovery appears to represent the third find of this axe type in Wales and the fourth in western Britain and may suggest a possible local clustering around Swansea, possibly indicating a network of exchange and circulation of metalwork around coastal South Wales.",,3,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2008-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,282.8,,,23,1360.9,1,Steve Sell,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Swansea,Swansea,Sketty,SS6390,From finder,51.592143,-3.979119,NMGW-E7E1C2,,wing axe.jpg,Winged axe drawing,,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/wing axe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/231977.jpg

1. South Wales-type socketed axe 



Length 102.0mm, blade width 54.0mm, weight 354.0g. 



This is a complete bronze axe with an outsplayed mouth moulding and a high loop. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped mouth in plan, with four runner stubs, indicating a four runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent and concave sides, expanding slightly near the blade edge. Three near parallel longitudinal ribs descend from the mouth moulding down both faces of the axe. Prominent casting flashes down the sides and around the loop indicate minimal preparation after casting. The blade edge is damaged but curved, with striations along the blade bevel, indicating some preparation of the blade for use. Much of the internal and external surfaces are covered with a black patination, worn surfaces and the blade edges having a grey-green patination.



2. South Wales-type socketed axe



Length 84.0mm, blade width 44.9mm, weight 211.4g.



This is a complete bronze axe with an outsplayed mouth moulding and a high loop. The axe has a sub-oval shaped mouth in plan, with four runner stubs, indicating a four runner casting technology. The axe has slightly divergent and concave shaped sides, expanding slightly near the blade edge. Three convergent longitudinal ribs descend from the mnouth moulding down both faces of the axe. Casting flashes survive down the sides and around the loop, indicating minimal preparation after casting. The blade edge is damaged but curved, with striations along the blade bevel, indicating some preparation of the blade for use. Some of the upper and internal surfaces are covered with a black patination, worn surfaces and the blade edges having a grey-green patination.","This small hoard was buried during the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age and dates to between 1000-800BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). South Wales -type axes were commonly made and used in south east Wales at this time (McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980; Needham 1981). Over 30 hoards containing at least 140 examples are known from this region (e.g. Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), making it the core areas within Britain for their burial within hoards. However, they were also made and used across south western and central southern England, with a few examples circulating as far as northern Britain, Ireland and northern France. The discovery of another similarly dated in the vicinity of this find-spot is interesting. This was found in 2005, some 358 metres to the north-west (Treasure Case 05.15 Wales). It contained nineteen artefacts, including sword fragments, an end-winged axe, South Wales-type socketed axes, a faceted axe, a casting jet and ingot fragments and is now displayed at the National Museum Cardiff (Museum Accession Number 2007.18H).

283890,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"
A small and creased fragment of gold foil. The foil is folded over in half and has jagged tear edges on three sides.
","The gold foil was found sitting immediately on a Bronze Age stone working surface, approximately 5.5 by 4.0 metres in area. Associated within the same soil context as the gold foil (2) were 31 sherds of Middle Bronze Age tradition pottery (1500-1100BC), a rolled-top bronze pin of Middle or Late Bronze Age (1500-800BC) date and an animal bone assemblage. It is possible that the small fragment of gold foil (2) may once have coated a penannular ring (hair-ring). These are a reasonably common class of Bronze Age artefacts, using gold foil for surface decoration. Loose and non-adhered foil is sometimes observed projecting from their terminals. While a number of dated examples belong to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800BC), it is now thought that they started to be manufactured towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1300-1150BC) (e.g. TAR 2004, no. 17; Raftery 2004). In the light of the associated pottery, a Middle to Late Bronze Age date (1300-1000BC) has been suggested for this foil.",3,Gold,Silver,,Controlled archaeological investigation,2008-07-02T23:00:00Z,,2008W8,,,,,,4.4,1,Adam Gwilt,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Llan-Maes,SS9869,Generated from computer mapping software,51.410817,-3.467992,NMGW-093625,,DH003186_05.jpg,Middle - Late Bronze Age gold foil,National Museums and Galleries of Wales,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH003186_05.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/235390.jpg
283900,Armlet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A plain and elongate gold strip with near parallel sides. One terminal survives, while the other has been torn around 4-7mm from the end. The surviving terminal is loosely folded over, with an external width of 3.5-5mm. The terminal tapers gradually beyond the fold-over, with a flat but slightly convex shaped end and rounded corners. An offset crease, parallel to the terminal-end is visible 2.2-2.5mm from the edge, the strip terminal also being pinched and thinned beyond the crease. Approximately 4mm from the terminal, a pin-hole approximately 0.8mm in diameter perforates the strip. Denting on the underside or interior of the fold-over indicates the pin was pressed from the current exterior side, though small projecting margin rings of excess gold are visible on both margin surfaces. A scrape next to the perforation was probably made in error with the same fine pin at the time the perforations were made.



The opposite terminal looks to be starting to taper, near the point of the tear. One torn corner has folded over since breakage. This terminal has two perforations, each approximately 0.8mm in diameter. One perforation is approximately 2.2mm from the torn end, while the tear has bisected the second perforation. Denting on one surface indicates the pin was pressed from the same side as the perforation on the other terminal, and projecting margin rings of excess gold are visible on both surface margins. The end 12mm of the strip exhibits prominent sinuous bending at right angles to the long-axis of the strip. At one time, this was probably bent over, similarly to the other terminal.



At the mid-point along the strip is a band, indicating a point at which the strip was once folded around a larger object, itself around 20-25mm wide. This folding point is evidenced on the interior side by a localised change in the surface gold texture and delimited by linear changes of surface contour around 3.5mm apart. On the exterior surface, there is slight evidence for lines of bending of the gold in the same place. The strip edge on one side also looks to be distorted at this point.



The strip looks to have been hammer-shaped, with small surface facets, pressed ridged folds and slight localised variations in the strip-width. Slight surface scratching probably occurred during burial and retrieval.","Average composition of edge: 93.5% gold, 6% silver, 0.5% copper

283957,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"Late Bronze Age bronze socketed axe fragment.



This is a small blade end fragment of a bronze socketed axe, representing perhaps 20% of the original axe. The sides of the axe flare at the blade end and the blade edge is curved. The base of the socket is clearly present. Too little of the axe survives to identify whether it was ribbed or plain and to type. The blade surfaces are worn and weathered, the break edges also being abraded. The axe has a dark brown patination.","Too little of this socketed axe fragment survives to identify it to precise type, however as a socketed axe, it may be confidently dated to the Late Bronze Age, between 1150-750BC (e.g. Savory 1980; Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Needham 1990; Needham et al 1997; Eogan 2000). The previously reported artefacts in the hoard, a ribbed socketed axe and a casting jet (produced when making a South Wales type socketed axe), were dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (950-750BC). Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that the blade fragment is contemporary with another two associated artefacts (Treasure case 03.17). The close vicinity of the finds with each other, at similar depth, and their common fragmented and weathered state, add weight to the likelihood that they were once buried together as a closed hoard group, being slightly disturbed by ploughing or forestry during the more recent past. Together, the composition and fragmentation of this hoard group would be entirely consistent with other hoards deposited in south east Wales at this time (Savory 1980; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004; Gwilt & Lodwick in prep).",3,Copper alloy,,,Metal detector,2008-07-14T23:00:00Z,,,,34.6,,,,26.3,1,Adam Gwilt,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llanhennock,ST3795,,51.650247,-2.911991,NMGW-0B0327,,DH003183_02.jpg,Late Bronze Age socketed axe blade,National Museums and Galleries of Wales,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/DH003183_02.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/235377.jpg

The sword fragment is represented by the base of the hilt and the very top of the blade (with a surviving length of 54.4mm and a weight of 77.5g).

289717,Dress Fastener (unknown),Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"Copper alloy ring of uncertain date, possibly a Late Bronze Age dress-fastener The ring is near-complete, with minimal peripheral damage to one of the terminals (with an overall height of 47.8mm and a weight of 99.1g). The terminals are joined but there is a fracture between the two sides (giving the object an overall width of 76.9mm). The terminals are circular but are irregular (with a diameter of 40mm) and are angled upwards towards the midpoint. The underside of the terminals have a crescent-shaped bevel on the outer edges, elsewhere the underside is concave and appears unfinished from casting. At the centre of each terminal are raised stubs around a rectangular depression (5.3mm long by 1.3mm wide), presumably the remnants of where the jet was removed, although it remains uncertain why the casting left rectangular depressions. The upper faces of the terminals have a raised edge defined by an internal groove. The finished edge does not continue onto the inner side of the terminals. The faces are convex, growing deeper towards the hoop (with a thickness of 6mm). There is a semicircular moulding around the hoop on both terminals (19mm long, 15mm wide and 1mm deep). The hoop (with a maximum external width of 60.2mm and internal: 44.1mm wide by 29.7mm high) is of oval section and is widest and deeper near the terminals (at 14mm wide and 9mm deep) and narrows to the midpoint of the hoop (7mm wide and 7mm deep). There are no discernible wear facets around the hoop. The inner face of the hoop has a casting flaw near one terminal, resulting from an air bubble. The surface of the copper alloy is pitted with a mid-brown patina and a silvery sheen, probably because of tin leaching, leading to surface enrichment.","Analysis to ascertain the metallurgical composition of the bronze was attempted using a CamScan MaXim 2040 analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM), plus an Oxford Instruments Link Isis energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Readings were taken from the surface and initial results appear to have been effected by the tin leaching referred to above, resulting in very high tin readings. Unusually, there was no lead detected in the readings. The ring appears to be unfinished on the terminals and any identification is somewhat speculative. The form of the artefact closely resembles 'dress-fasteners', particularly if the terminals were finished and separated to form a penannular ring. Dress-fasteners are of Late Bronze Age date, generally associated with the Ewart Park and Llyn Fawr metalworking industry, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Periods 7 and 8, dated to c. 950-750BC and 750-450BC respectively. Dress-fasteners are of uncertain function, and are generally made of gold and recovered from Ireland and Scotland, with outliers from Yorkshire and Norfolk (Eogan 1994, p 98, fig 40) . Bronze examples are occasionally recovered, such as in the Mountrivers Hoard, County Cork, Ireland (Eogan, 1994, Plate XVI) and the Poolewe Hoard, Ross and Cromarty, Scotland (Schmidt & Burgess, plate 152) .

The socketed axe is fragmentary, represented by only a blade side fragment (with a surviving length of 41.3mm, a surviving width of 26.2mm and a weight of 42.7g). The base of the socket is present at the top of the fragment (where the axe has a surviving thickness of 13.4mm, the axe faces have a thickness of 5mm and the socket has a maximum width of 3.8mm and a surviving depth of 9.6mm). The axe side appears to flare outwards towards the mouth, although corrosion may have eroded the shape. The surviving side was likely to have been convex across its width or have had a hexagonal body profile. The faces of the fragment are straight and converge to the blade. The blade edge has been lost. The axe has a significant crack across one face and the side, which is likely to have occurred in antiquity. The broken side of the axe is patinated, suggesting that the axe was broken in antiquity. Areas of brown surface patina survive, elsewhere the fragment is pale green with a powdery surface.

The axe is incomplete missing the butt (with a surviving length of 59.2mm and a weight of 64.7g). The axe is of sub rectangular section and is comparatively slender and stout (with a width at the break of 18.0mm and a thickness of 8.8mm). The axe fragment reaches its thickest point (at 9.4mm), 36mm from the blade edge. The sides of the axe are straight and near parallel for the length of the blade. The casting seams are not discernible on the sides of the axes. The blade faces are plain and slightly convex, both across their lengths and widths. There are no flanges on the surviving blade faces. The blade width expands sharply at the position where the blade facet begins (13mm from the blade edge). The blade edge is now comparatively straight, turning at the edges and has lost the blade tips (with a surviving blade width of 28.1mm). The blade edge appears to have been blunted through impact. There is the suggestion of sharpening striations running perpendicular to the blade edge but these have been obscured by a varnish coating of the axe. One face of the axe has probable stress fractures near the break and also has two impact marks (both 6.6mm long and 1.5mm wide), presumably from a bladed tool, perhaps another axe. The other face has a casting flaw near the break. The axe has a pale to dark green surface patina and has a recent gloss coating.



The missing butt makes identification and typological dating difficult. It is unclear to what degree of finishing the axe has undergone and whether the blade and flanges were yet to be worked. The 'blocky' nature of the axe would appear to either suggest a Developed flat axe of Metalworking Assemblage IV - V or a Later Short-flanged type of Taunton - Penard metalworking. Its form can be paralleled with some Class 4 developed flat axes (following Needham forthcoming) which can be dated to Needham's (1996) Period 3 dated to c. 1950-1700BC. Alternatively, Later Short-flanged axes fall within Period 5, dated to c.1500-1150BC. The apparent non introduction of lead into the bronze alloy may suggest an earlier technology and lend weight to an identification of a developed flat axe.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,,,,64.7,,,,59.2,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Penllyn,SS9878,,51.491714,-3.470589,NMGW-A4E598,,2009.59.jpg,Early - Middle Bronze Age axe,PAS,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2009.59.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/275527.jpg
291709,Barbed And Tanged Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1500,"An apparently complete cast copper alloy barbed and tanged arrowhead, of Early Bronze Age date (2150 - 1500 BC).






The arrow has a deep brown patina typical of bronze artefacts of this date.  It was manufactured using a relatively simple casting technique. It is very worn and chipped around the edges. However, a raised midrib and bevelled edges are apparent. The body of the blades are slightly concave. The tang is sub-rectangular , tapering slightly towards the end, which could be a break rather than a deliberate end. It has relatively crude notches between the tang and barbs. The chipping and wearing on the edges and body indicate use wear rather than post-depositional damage, and so suggest a long period of use for this object. The style of the arrowhead copies flint barbed and tanged arrowheads of the period. Copper alloy arrowheads of this style and dates are rare in Britain. Other examples recorded on the PAS database can be found at SF-4014B0, WMID-CE6A76 and SF6680. All other examples are stray detector finds and consequently the accurate dating of the objects is problematic. However, Dr. Colin Pendleton (SCCAS) notes that there is no reason to doubt that these are contemporary with Early Bronze Age flint examples of similar form.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.72,,,2,43,1,Julie Cassidy,Julie Cassidy,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,,,,,,,NARC-F9B223,,sargent arrowhead.jpg,arrowhead,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution-ShareAlike License,https://finds.org.uk/images/jcassidy/sargent arrowhead.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/276364.jpg

383228,Axehead,Bronze Age,,,-1700,-1500,"A copper-alloy cast axehead  dating from the end of the early Bronze Age, from circa 1700 - 1500  BC. The axe suffers from wear and corrosion, but appears to be a  developed  flat axe, possibly of Type Bandon (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 31).  The poor level of preservation makes it difficult to ascertain whether  there was originally any decoration on the axe, so close identification  of the type is tentative.


The axe has low ridges running  along each lateral edge, becoming less pronounced towards the blade  and the butt. A low bevel is situated between these ridges, running  from the butt for 43.6 until a very low stop ridge runs across the face.   This stop ridge is not in the same place on both sides of the axe head,  occurring at 57.7 mm from the butt on one side. The axe has a crescent  shaped blade, 49.12 mm in width. The axe gradually flares in width from  20.2 mm at the base to 31.2 just before the blade. It is lozenge shaped  in profile and measures 103.36 mm in length. It is 3.7 mm thick at the  butt, 12.8 mm thick in its centre and 0.8 mm thick at the tip of the  blade.  It weighs 151.5 grams.

The socket measures 12.45 mm long and 15.23 mm wide at the broken attachment end and approximately 10.7 mm in diameter at the broken tip end. Either side of the socket is a chamfered wing, emerging just after the break at the shaft end. The spearhead measures 41.55 mm long and is 27.41 mm at its widest point. It is 13.05 mm thick and weighs 18.0 grams. The surface has a dark green to black patina, heavily pitted in places.

387225,Pin,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete late Bronze Age copper alloy pin dating c. 1000-800BC. The pin has a globular head with radiating vertical incised lines. The shaft of the pin has a circular cross-section and only slightly tapers to one end. This end is rough and has the appearance of a break. Midway down the shaft is a collar with a perforation through it. The upper section of the pin, between the globular head and perforated collar, is completely covered in engraved decoration. The pattern comprises a band of rings around the shaft then a section of rows of diagonal lines extending along the length of the pin; then a section of four repeating patterns of herringbone motifs with a linear border. This complete pattern is repeated along the length of the pin stopping below the perforated collar, leaving the final remaining third of the pin undecorated. There appears to be some evidence of wear around the perforation on the collar. The collar is also decorated with the same technique as the rest of the pin; the pattern here comprises a double saltire cross on each site of the collar. The copper alloy has a dark green patina.

On each 'wing', there are incised grooves running lengthwise for a little under half the total length. The ends are plain and taper to slender blunt points, one of which has lost its tip. A comparable scabbard chape can be found illustrated in Smith (1925, 75; fig. 67).","These objects, of which only a few are known from Britain, are all distinctly moustache shaped, but some are of more 'droopy' appearance than others.

Dr Kevin Leahy comments:


This is a most unusual socketed axe as it is the first one that I have seen that shows any sign of being truncated by wear/shapening. Most socketed axes retain their proportions.

391756,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave, of Group II: Early Midribbed type, possibly of Type Liswerry (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 125-128)[1].



The palstave is unlooped and is complete (with a length of 148.3mm and a weight of 346.2g). The butt is rounded at the corners and the sides diverge slightly (with a width at the butt of 17mm) to the start of the flanges. The flanges begin 23mm from the butt and rise to a maximum height (of 30.3mm) before the stop. The sides are straight and parallel (with a width of 25.1mm) until the blade, where the sides are concave and divergent. The casting seams are evident on both sides and appear to be raised on the sides of the blade. The blade tips are slightly eroded (producing a blade width of 54.6mm) and the blade edge has an expanded blade edge. The septum is gently concave (with a maximum depth of 12mm, a width of 17mm and a length of 64mm). The stops are slightly rounded and there is a casting flaw between the stop and septum on one face. The stops are raised above the blade faces (with a height of 8mm and an overall depth of 29.2mm). The blade faces are decorated with a prominent and comparatively short mid-rib (33m long). The blade faces are slightly raised at the sides, suggesting short side ribs. A blade facet is discernible (13m from the blade edge). Remnant traces of the original surface survive, mostly on the septum and within the flanges with a dark green to black patina; elsewhere the surface is pitted and is pale green.



The palstave has a narrow body similar to Type Liswerry, although the flange extensions are comparatively short, similar to Type Chepstow. The dating of Group II palstaves corresponds to the ActonPark metalworking industry, equating to Needham's (1996)[2] Period 5, dated to 1,500 - 1,150BC.

391840,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,,-1200,-800,"Cast copper alloy socketed axehead. The mouth of the socket is sub-rectangular in shape this has a moulded collar running around its circumference on the outside with the side loop beginning just below the moulding. Running down either side is casting flash. The main shaft of the axe is rectangular in cross section, with three pronounced moulded ridges that run down from the socket and converge just above the blade to form a V-shape. The blade is crescent shaped.











The casting of this axe is extremely poor, this combined with poor quality metal has resulted in heavy pitting over the whole artefact. This pitting would have occurred during the manufacturing process and would most likely be the result of bubbles forming in the mould during casting.  Considering the poor quality of the metal and it's weaken state due to poor casting, it is unlikely this axe was used as a tool, but instead may have been used ritualistically.

399510,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-600,"A cast copper alloy socketed axehead that in style, is consistent with the Sompting type with a prominent bulbous biconical collar with a horizontal moulding beneath. Sompting axes are typical of the Llyn Fawr phase, technically seen as the Bronze-Iron Age transition and sometimes now called the Earliest Iron Age (800-600BC). 

The axehead has a sub square section mouth. The fixing loop is then drawn from the lower moulding to extend 24mm down the side moulding with an inner diameter of 8mm.











The axe is undecorated with flat plain sides, no edge chamfer and broadly splayed to the cutting edge; the seam sides are wedge shape in plan and slightly convex with clear casting lines. Although there are numerous marks/gouges to the surface of the axe, they look to be due to the passage of time in the ground. There are no clear signs of use.











Coming to the damage to the axe; there is significant and extensive damage that appears to be contemporary with the date of the axe. One side of the blade has been struck very hard with a heavy round object such to cause the axe to bend and split on the opposing face. The edge of the blade has then also been struck several times with a similar heavy round object, leading to an almost denticulate edge with four clear strikes. The damage must have been deliberate and had rendered the axe useless.











The reason for the damage may only be speculated at; it may have been an unsatisfactory casting or perhaps prepared for votive use or simply come to the end of its useful life. The surface has a bright mottled green patina with some original smooth brownish surface patina still in evidence.","Plain examples in Schmidt & Burgess (1981) The Axes of Scotland and Northern England.

Discussion

The Type Meldreth and Yorkshire socketed axes, the bar toggle, the probable phalara fragments and the nail headed pin all date this hoard to the Ewart Park metalwork phase (c. 1000-800 BC) in the Late Bronze Age. Type Yorkshire socketed axes are frequently found in hoards from East Anglia to Scotland (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 223) and Type Meldreth socketed axes are well known throughout Britain, Ireland and Western Europe (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 204). Nail headed pins are rarer but are found throughout England, including the northeast with comparable pins found in Heathery Burn Cave, County Durham (Britton and Longworth 1968, nos. 95-108; O'Connor 1980, 200, list 180, map 63). Bar toggles are occasionally found in hoards in England (see Rafferty 1975; O'Connor 1980, 196 and List 169) and although the Stannington example lacks the distinguishing central loop or perforation, it is possible that this is due to the breakage on the rectangular protrusion.

The probable cauldron handle fragment is comparable in shape and dimensions to the two cauldron handles placed in a hoard with a two blade fragments and 11 socketed axes, including one of Type Yorkshire, at Kilkerran, Ayrshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, plate 147 and p. 225-226, no. 1383; for further discussion of Late Bronze Age cauldrons, buckets and their handles see Gerloff 2010). The probable phalara fragments are interpreted, as are the bar toggles, as horse gear and are found throughout England and beyond (O'Connor 1975; 1980, 197, list 171.) with two from the northeast at Heathery Burn cave and Eastgate, Co. Durham (O'Connor 1975, 220). The final object, a probable wagon fitting, has no straightforward parallel in Britain or beyond but is broadly comparable to sections of Late Bronze Age tubular wagon fittings found in the Hart a. d. Alz group in Central Europe (see Pare 1992, 18-42). Despite the relative rarity of certain object types in the hoard, the assemblage is comparable to parts of the Heathery Burn Cave, County Durham hoard(s) (Britton and Longworth 1968) and Kilkerran, Ayrshire hoard (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 225-226) amongst others.

Conclusion

The hoard fulfils the requirements for being considered Treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act (2002 Amendment).
