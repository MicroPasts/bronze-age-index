798423,Finger Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1150,"A copper alloy finger ring of Middle Bronze Age date (c. 1400-1150 BC). The ring consists of a single copper alloy bar, oval in cross-section which has been coiled to create the finger ring. It now has one complete loop and two incomplete loops. It appears to be complete, although both terminals exhibt traces of damage. The ring has a smooth dark green patina, with occasional pitting.



This example is similar to a number of coiled rings found in a Middle Bronze Age hoard found in Sussex, recorded under SUSS-C5D042. Similar rings have been found in the Mecklenburg area of North Germany suggesting close associations with the Continent. A brief period in the Middle Bronze Age is marked by the occurrence, in hoards, of tools and bronze ornaments which owe their inspiration to types current in north Germany and Scandinavia from c.1400 BC. These include torcs, coiled finger rings, ribbed bracelets, knobbed sickles, and square-mouthed socketed axes. This influx seems to have given a boost to the native bronze industry.

798508,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1150,"A hoard of 10 copper alloy palstave axeheads, found in one spot, described as 'one hole' and therefore possibly a pit deposit. The artefacts have been numbered 1-10 for the following catalogue.



Description:



1) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy axehead in good condition, with corrosion of the surface visible. Requires further conservation to remove the remaining soil. The butt is slightly damaged, with a small chip missing from one corner. The flanges start to rise gradually, in a convex curve from the butt, fusing to the stop bar at the maximum height above the septum. The body of the axe is narrow and expands into a triangular blade which flares slightly. The cutting edge is relatively complete except for small pockets of corrosion damage along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is asymmetrical which suggests use and possible resharpening, with one blade tip slightly rounded. Both faces are corroded but a small sub-triangular depression below the stop bar, surrounded by a raised triangle can be seen, notwithstanding the corrosion and remaining soil.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 67mm, axe length: 167mm, stop bar width: 23mm, flange width at stop bar: 31mm, butt width: min 16mm, weight: 506g.





2) Palstave axehead. A complete Palstave axehead in two sections, broken diagonally below the butt. Corrosion is visible over the surface with growths on one blade surface.  The cross section across the break reveals a U-shaped septum. The flanges rise from the butt end to the stop bar which is raised. Parts of the flanges are damaged (on one side more so) due to corrosion. The separate butt end is asymmetrical in shape, with one corner quite rounded and the other irregular due to damage, suggesting a degree or wear prior to further corrosion-related damage. Both faces of the break reveal a pitted interior to the metal, which may have caused this area of weakness leading to a break. Casting seams are visible along both sides of the body of the axe, which appear to have been polished off the blade edges closer to the cutting edge. The blade is slightly asymmetrical which suggests some degree of wear along with rounded blade tips. A sub-triangular depression is identifiable beneath the stop bar on each face. On one face a linear depression extends from this area, which could indicate ancient damage. Other marks are found on both faces and the cutting edge but could relate to corrosion or the recovery of the artefacts.



Dimensions -



Blade width:71mm, section 1 length (butt): 34.5mm, section 2 length (axe body): 134mm, axe length (total): 168.5mm, stop bar width: 20.5mm, flange width at stop bar: 31mm, butt width: min 16mm, weight (section 1): 45g, weight (section 2): 414g, weight (total): 459g.





3) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead, with surface corrosion visible, and some soil remaining on the item, therefore requiring some conservation. The butt is slightly rounded would could suggest some wear. Triangular flanges, with slight corrosion-related damage, rise from the butt end to the stop bar which is the point of maximum height above the septum. Below the septum is a hollow, just visible on both faces but obscured by dried earth and corrosion. The narrow body of the butt end expands into a triangular blade with a slight flare of the blade tips. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical with some recent damage to the corroded metal edge. There are a few small hollows visible on the blade surface and within the septum which could be a result of impurities in the cast metal or as a result of corrosion.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 75mm, axe length: 176mm, stop bar width: 25mm, flange width at stop bar: 28mm, butt width: 20mm, weight: 475g.





4) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy palstave axehead. The butt is damaged in the centre, the flanges rise from here to the stop bar giving a convex side profile. Below the stop bar is a depression with a raised shield design, consisting of three raised linear lines contained within a raised shield outline. The design appears on both faces. The blade is triangular but flares on one side towards the blade tip, the corresponding tip has no flare but is also damaged and corroded - this tip is also the lower side of the asymmetrical cutting edge. There are chips along the cutting edge which could be a mixture of ancient damage and metal corrosion, but a sharpened blade facet is visible beneath the corrosion and dried earth.



Dimensions -



Blade width:66.5mm, axe length: 162.5mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 31mm, butt width: 16.5mm (damaged), weight: 456g.





5) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy axehead with surface corrosion. One face appears to be in a better condition than the reverse side. The butt is damaged in the centre, with one corner also missing - this damage appears to be ancient. The flanges rise in a slight convex curve towards the stop bar. Beneath the stop bar appears to be a small depression in a sub-triangular shape at the top of the blade face. The blade itself expands into a triangular shaped blade with slight flaring towards the blade tips. The cutting edge appears quite straight suggesting wear in the central section.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 71mm, axe length: 173mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 26mm, butt width: 19mm (damaged), weight: 478g.





6) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead. The axe has a square butt end, with flanges rising in a convex fashion towards the stop bar from c.2cm from the butt. The body and butt end of the axe is narrow before expanding out into a crinoline blade. On both faces the blade facet can be seen as a result of sharpening the cutting edge. The cutting edge itself is almost complete with small areas of damage (probably due to corrosion). Beneath the stop bar is a small sub-triangular depression. It may be possible to see usewear marks on the cutting edge once the axe has been conserved.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 70mm, axe length: 173mm, stop bar width: 21mm, flange width at stop bar:, butt width: 20mm, weight: 444g.





7) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead in good condition apart from areas of surface corrosion, particularly on the lower half of the blade. The butt end is slightly damaged on one corner, possibly in antiquity. The flanges rise from the butt end to the stop bar, creating a triangular side profile. The blade is triangular with an asymmetrical cutting edge, although there is little damage to the blade itself. One blade tip is missing, and apart from this small area of damage and the slight damage to the butt, the axe is complete. A clear raised triangular design sits beneath the stop bar, consisting of two raised linear bands with a central depression, the design is visible on both axe faces.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 68mm, axe length: 181mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 32mm, butt width: 18mm, weight: 503g.





8) Palstave axehead.  A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead. The butt is damaged slightly but largely complete, and flanges rise towards the stop bar creating a slightly convex side profile. Beneath the stop bar is a sub-triangular indentation, visible on both blade faces. The blade itself expands and flares outwards towards the blade tips. The cutting edge is damaged with a number of chips along its length, some modern and possibly occurring during recovery, others perhaps ancient and prior to deposition. A blade facet is visible on both sides, showing sharpening had occurred to shape the cutting edge.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 74.5mm, axe length: 178mm, stop bar width: 22mm, flange width at stop bar: 27mm, butt width: 20mm, weight: 491g.





9) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy Palstave axehead, with no signs of physical damage other than that related to corrosion. The butt is square, with flanges rising from the butt end to the stop bar, creating a triangular side profile. The blade is triangular, and flares slightly towards the blade tips. The blade side appears to be rounded. Below the stop bar a small sub-triangular depression is visible on one face, whereas on the reverse face the depression would appear more circular in shape. The surface of the blade shows evidence of corrosion, but the cutting edge is complete apart from some corrosion-related flaking.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 71mm, axe length: 181mm, stop bar width: 25mm, flange width at stop bar: mm, butt width: 20mm, weight: 529g.





10) Palstave axehead. A complete copper alloy axehead. The axe shows evidence of corrosion, particularly on the lower half of the blade face. The butt is square with some damage to the corners and the centre. The flange side profile is triangular, with nicks prominent along the line of the stop bar. The casting seam is also visible along the flange sides on the butt end of the axe. The blade is triangular but flares towards the blade tips, one of which is missing, and appears to have been damaged in antiquity. The cutting edge is asymmetrical but largely complete suggesting it was resharpened in antiquity. The design beneath the stop bar is a small triangular depression, surrounded by anther incised triangular design, creating the illusion of a raised triangle. This is particularly clear on one face, however the reverse face is likely to be of a similar design, but is obscured through remaining earth and corrosion.



Dimensions -



Blade width: 68mm, axe length: 177mm, stop bar width: 24mm, flange width at stop bar: 27mm, butt width: 18mm, weight: 480g.







Identification/discussion: 



The axeheads described above (Nos.1-10) are all identifiable as palstave axeheads which belonging to the Middle Bronze Age period (c.1400-1150 cal BC). The axes within this hoard all suffer with surface corrosion obscuring the original surface of the blade, making usewear analysis difficult;





The palstaves Nos. 1-3, 5-6 & 8-9, are comparable to those placed within Rowlands 'class 3 group 1' including a similar axe surviving in a hoard from Goudhurst, Kent (see Rowlands 1976: pl 2 (85) no.3, and p. 247). Rowlands class 3 are characterised by a U-shaped septum profile, low triangular or slightly convex flanges, a straight sided triangular or crinoline blade and a triangular depression or ribbed motif beneath the stop bar (Rowlands 1976: 32-33). Group 1 and 2 within class 3 are divided based on blade width, being 7-8cm and 5-6cm respectively, placing the above axes between the two, but probably within group 1. Using the PAS Palstave Guide these examples would be categorised as 'group 2' ('early palstaves' https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/axes [accessed 12/10/17]). A number of the axes within this hoard which sit within this category have blades which slightly flare towards the blade tips and are not purely triangular in shape. Axes Nos.1,2,5-6 & 8 all have identifiable sub-triangular motifs, whereas axes Nos.3 & 9 are slightly different in how clear the motif is. No.9 has one side which appears to be a more circular depression in comparison to the reverse side motif.





Axe No.10 has an unusual triangular design, which is difficult to identify. This axe is directly comparable with axe No.1& 5 from 2017 T459, with the clear triangular design and axe size being almost identical, apart from the direction of curve of the blade sides. Examples with similar designs can be found in O'Connor 1980, which includes a looped Palstave with similar v-shaped ornamentation from the Gable Head Hoard (O'Connor 1980: p321-2, Fig.6 No.25), and a broken Palstave with V-ornament from the Marshall Estate Hoard, Sussex (O'Connor 1980, p.328, Fig.14, No12). Although similar in design, these published examples are not quite identical. Axe No.7 is similar in that there appears to be a raised triangular design, however there is no corresponding outer incised line.





Axe No.4 has a clear shield design, composed of a raised shield outline with 3 linear ribs within, running in the direction of the axe.  A comparable example is an axe from Lower Swanwick, a hoard of four palstaves buried in a pit (Rowlands 1976: 240). Axe 1 from this site has a similar shield design below the stop bar (see Rowlands 1976: p7, (63) no.1), which Rowalds' identifies as a Class 3 Group 1 palstave (1976: 240). A further example is found within the Birchington hoard - a collection of fourteen palstaves found within an urn (Rowlands 1976: 246; pl.10 (82) no.10)). Along with palstaves Nos. 1-3, 5-6 & 8-9, No.4 can be considered a 'Birchington Type' palstave (Rowlands 1976: 32-3).





A similar hoard of palstave was also found in the immediate vicinity by the same finder at a later date (see 2017 T459 - KENT-593613). The number (ten) of the palstaves found in the hoard is comparable to those found in 2017 T459, which was found only a short distance away. Furthermore, they appear to have been deposited in similar manners: as a group deposit in a pit. Axes Nos. 1-3, 5-6 & 8-9 are comparable to eight of the axes found within hoard 2017 T459, and axe No. 10 is comparable to axe no.1 from hoard 2017 T459.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,2016T618,,,,,,,10,Jennifer Jackson,Jennifer Jackson,South East,Kent,Thanet,Manston,TR3467,GPS (from the finder),51.35385881,1.35933957,KENT-495597,,2016T618_10_view1.JPG,Palstave Axe 10 view 1,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/2016T618_10_view1.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/635029.jpg
798710,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete cast copper alloy Mid to Late Bronze-Age dagger blade. It consists of a small fragment of the hilt, with the remnants of two rivet holes, with apparently most of the blade. It is sub lense shaped in cross section, with a slightly emphasised central rib on both sides of the blade and tear drop shape in form, tapering to a rounded point. It is difficult to be certain how much, if any, of the blade is missing. It is 67.88mm in length, 28.00mm in width at its widest and weighs 13.55g.The surface has a dark green patina and shows abraded patches. This dagger is perhaps typical of the Penard phase of the Bronze Age (1275 BC to c. 1140 BC). It is very similar to a Grp III rapier, or more likely, a dirk.

The axe head is trapezoidal in shape with a curved broad butt and blade. There is no significant flare to the blade end. The axe had a lenticular cross-section and has signs of wear to both the blade and butt ends. The butt end is 17.7 x 2.6 mm, that widens to 33.58 x 3.37 at the blade. The axe head appears to be of a broad butt type, probably a 'Migdale' type (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p 35-44).

The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There is damge to both edges of the blade.



It measures 56.3 mm in length, 13.9 mm wide (base), 5.4 mm wide (tip) and 6.5mm thick. It weighs 9.7 g.



The spear head is a mid green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. This object has lost most of it's diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult.

The object is bifacial and narrowly convex, with no central midrib. The object is roughly trapezoidal when laid flat and roughly triangular in profile. The socket is waisted and a pointed oval in cross-section, with no visible peg-holes. There is a triangular facet down one side; the other side may also have been faceted but is now too worn to discern. The rim of the socket has a rough, uneven edge where it terminates in an ancient break. The interior of the object is encrusted with dirt from the end of the waist. Both faces are smooth and have a brown patina. The edge and the socket on one face have a rough, green surface where the outer layer has been worn away.

The axe is heavily eroded and has breaks across the butt and the side loop. The blade gently flares to the cutting edge; the sides are straight, and in section the blade is rectangular. The cutting edge is abraded and appears to have been reground several times owing to the lack of expanded blade at the edges.The axe has a pronouced stop-ridge on both sides, though on one side it is damaged. Two moulded ridges run away from the stop-ridge down the blade on both sides. These ridges are difficult to see on the side that has suffered the greatest damage. The butt is incomplete.



The surface of the axe is variable. Towards the cutting edge the blade on both sides has a smooth surface with green-brown patina. It is heavily pitted towards the stop-ridge on one side. The butt is heavily pitted on both sides.



The length of the axe is 125mm, and the height across the blade is 39mm. At the stop ridge it is 25mm in height, and 24mm in width.

Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is deeply pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease.Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which was found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

802293,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed chisel, wedge-shaped in profile and sub-rectangular in plan, with parallel sides. One side of the chisel has broken away to reveal the socket within, which is 36 mm long and 12 mm wide, but the upper mouth of the socket is missing. The chisel is corroded and pitted but there appears to be no active bronze disease. The blade has a curved edge which is worn, and fragments of the edge have been broken off in the past, but it appears to mainly follow the original edge with no flaring of the tips. There are small scars on both faces that are probably the result of plough damage. The hollow interior is cone-shaped, with the socket ending 20 mm up from the blade. The cross-section of the chisel is sub-rectangular with the walls ranging from 2 to 3 mm in thickness. The chisel is missing its butt end and was probably about 70-80 mm in length originally. The shape and curve of the blade suggest that this might have been a tool for carving wood, with the rounded edge enabling the carver to work with a concave area. The angle of the bevel, at about 20°, would have made it ideal for fine work where thin slivers of wood were being removed. 



Needham & Rohl (1998) illustrate a similar example on page 132, no.175, which is dated to the Penard phase of the late Middle Bronze Age, c.1300-1150 BC.

802317,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-850,"A complete cast copper-alloy tanged chisel of Late Bronze Age date. The chisel is in good copndition and appears undamaged, with evidence for use wear on the blade tip and edge. The chisel has a tapering square-sectioned tang, 6.66mm thick, which abutts the round-sectioned, collared handle stop of the chisel blade. The collar is 11.7mm diameter. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in profile and expands to a very thin cutting edge with slightly flared shoulders. The cutting edge is 33.2mm wide. The object is in very good coniditon and has a mid-brown patina across much of its surface.



Tanged chisels, which date from c. 1150-850 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds; complete examples from such contexts are uncommon. Several tanged chisels, or elements of them, are recorded on this database (for example, see BH-49EAD8).

802377,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-2050,"An incomplete copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of the Early Bronze Age, dating from c. BC 2500 - BC 2050



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid in shape. The butt is relatively thin having a flat edge, the butt has been broken. The patina at the break matches with the rest of the axe suggesting the break occurred in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. There is no evidence of the long edges being raised to form flanges and there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge). However, the axe is thickest at the mid point (9.5 mm). The sides of the blade expand slightly to produce a crescentic blade edge with a width of 62.2 mm. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. The blade facet has been heavily abraded and is virtually no longer visible, however the top and bottom of the blade do slope gently down to the edge. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. 



The object measures 86.2 mm in length. The width at the butt is 45.4 mm, the centre is 51.5 mm wide and the blade is 62.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 6.9 mm, the centre is 9.5 mm thick and the blade is 5.3 mm thick. The axehead weighs 252.1 g. 



The axe is a mid to dark brown in colour with a much abraded or corroded patina. Traces of a light green patina, suggesting corrosion products. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of most of the original surface detail. 



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age (or possibly even the Copper Age). This example fits best into the copper axes and early bronze axes. The form of the axe is comparable to Type Castletown Roche/Pitlochry (outlined by Schmidt and Burgess p 22-23, Plate 1, No 5). These axes fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage I-II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 1-2 circa 2500- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae. Similar axeheads have also been recorded on the database including HESH-ACD6C1, HESH-84D8A5 and LANCUM-AA5ED7.

802623,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy axehead of the Late Bronze Age. The axehead is broken just above the deep end of the socket. The fragment is trapezoidal in plan with a convex cutting edge, which appears complete. The object is covered with a green patina, mostly light green but with dark, shiny patches. The patina also covers the break surface, suggesting that the break is an ancient one. Apart from the break the object shows relatively little abrasion or damage.



The object is 35mm wide at the break, flaring to 46mm at the cutting edge, and 24mm in length, It is 8mm thick at the break, tapering to less than 1 mm at the cutting edge.

The fragment is most likely to derive from a socketed axe. It is difficult to make a more precise classification due to the shape of the remaining fragment, however, it has been suggested that it is more likely to be a Late Bronze Age socketed axe due to the position of the break along the body and the shape of the blade. The axehead is broadly trapezoidal in plan and triangular in profile. The fragment consists of a small portion of the blade and part of the socket. The blade tips are intact, however, the cutting edge has been removed by a series of old breaks. The blade narrows along its length away from the cutting edge and terminates in an old break.

803218,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"Two pieces of an incomplete copper-alloy late Bronze Age sword, dating to the period c.1100-800 BC. The two pieces fit together to form a blade that expands outwards from its pointed terminal before narrowing again. Worn breaks are present where the point has broken off, at the line of impact where the two pieces have separated and at the terminal which would have been closest to the grip. Corrosion is present in patches over the surface on both sides and the edges are very worn. The sword has a wide central ridge down its length and a lozengiform cross section which narrows in thickness towards the point. A brown and green patina is present on the surface.



Although most of the diagnostic features have been lost, the 'tongue-like' form of the blade suggests an Ewart Park or Wilburton type (Dot Boughton and Peter Reavill pers comm). 



Piece A measures 162.35mm in length, 37.75mm in width at its widest, 12.21mm in width at its narrowest, 8.06mm in thickness at its thickest (the middle point of its cross section) and weighs 168g.

803236,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Incomplete cast copper alloy long-flanged axehead with a crescentic blade that has worn to rounded terminals, dating from the Early Bronze Age. The blade is trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the broken edge. The blade is incomplete and would have expanded to a crescent shape with pointed ends orginally. The blade narrows towards the broken end, which is below where the transverse stop ridge would have been, stopping the haft or handle from sliding down the blade when the axe was being used. There are seven transverse ridges and grooves surviving on one of the faces of the axe, between the flanges and above the crescentic blade, which range in length from 18 mm to 32 mm and are each about 4 mm wide. The surface of both faces is very pitted and there are patches of green corrosion product within some of these pits. 



Flanged axes decorated with transverse grooves and crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig.28, no.87).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar flanged axe with wide transverse grooves on the blade from Staxton in North Yorkshire in plate 33, no.411, which is classified as a Type Arreton long flanged axe and dated from the Arreton metalwork phase.



An example of a local Arreton flanged axe with the area above the crescentic blade decorated with incised transverse bands is illustrated in Pearce (1983) on page 615, pl.54, no.427.



The Arreton metalwork phase now dates from c.1700-1500 BC (Matt Knight pers comm).","Report by Matt Knight:



This is the lower blade of a small axe with the remains of low flanges extending onto the blade and an expanding crescentic cutting edge. There are four transverse grooves separated by five ridges on one face, spread between the flanges close to the break. There are the faint remains of the same decoration on the opposite face. These range in length from 8-32mm and are each about 4mm wide. It has been suggested these are destructive but the regular spacing and fine nature suggests they were decorative. The axe has broken below any possible transverse bevel so it is difficult to definitely identify, but the overall form of the axe is suggestive of Needham's Class 5, dating to the Arreton period.



Due to the corroded nature, it is difficult to identify definite signs of preparation and use. It is likely that the flanges were hammered up and the cutting edge had been worked to shape. The ridge and grooves are consistently patinated indicating these were deliberate decoration.



The axe has broken unevenly in antiquity across the middle of the blade, through the flanges. The break is consistently patinated/corroded and there are at least two macroscopic casting inclusions present in the break, which would have influenced the breakage. The ridge and grooves are situated very close to the break, raising the possibility that this was a deliberately destructive act, with the grooves representing failed strikes. However, it is more likely that the axe may have broken while incising the decoration.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-07-24T23:00:00Z,2016-07-24T23:00:00Z,,,103.4,,,11,58,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Madron,SW4733,From finder,50.1429742,-5.54236741,CORN-183F23,,Sep16finds060.JPG,flanged axe (decorated face),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/Sep16finds060.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/582245.jpg

803473,Pin,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1400,-400,"A near complete copper alloy hair or dress pin, possibly a derivative of a Picardy-type pin of Middle Bronze Age date. The pin has a globular head with flat, indented top. Below the head is a slightly swollen collar decorated with two circumferential lines of simple incised linear scores of shirt length, arrange vertically around the pin. The shaft of the pin then tapers slowly with a sub-circular section into the almost rectangular terminal, which appears to be missing the very tip. The pin has been bent round and is now penannular; this may have been purposeful and reused as a bracelet. The pin does have similarities with an example of Cool's (1990:170) Class 24 pins of probably second century AD date, however identations on pin heads are seen throughout the Iron Age too. This pin does share similarities to Early and Middle Iron Age 'cup-headed pins' however examples of this period display a deeper cup than seen on the example recorded here. The patina, head style and otherwise simple form and decoration of this pin does suggest an early date - possibly Middle Bronze Age (1400-1250 BC) through to the Middle Iron Age (to c. 400 BC).","Picardy type pins are dated from the early Taunton phase of the Bronze Age and according to the most recent interpretations probably go out of use by the Renard phase, giving a date range of between c.1400 and 1250 BC (Roberts, 2007: 141).

805221,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A developed flat axe with hammer raised flanges of later Early Bronze Age date (c. 2000 - 1700 BC) specifically of the axe type Arreton which is dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.



This axehead is broadly sub-rectangular with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt is narrow and rounded and measures 22mm in width and is 3.4mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than cast flanges .The expanded blade measures 43.64mm in width and is 2.4mm thick.



The axe is in good condition although there is some damage to the blade. The object has a green patina and the surface is slightly pitted. A small area of the original cutting surface survives on the central part of the blade but there is some damage towards the peripheries of the cutting edge. The sides of the axe are raised, with distinct but very low flanges extending from the base of the blade to near the butt. There is no evidence of casting seams which would indicate that the axehead has been reworked after casting to produce the raised flanges.



The axehead measures 96.19mm in length, 43.64mm in width (at the blade) is 11.4mm thick and weighs 131.04g.



In HESH-3AFE67 Peter Reavill comments that the axehead is best described as coming from the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 420, 423and 413). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

805523,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of five objects.



1. Palstave butt end fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 24.7mm; butt width 23.5mm; max. thickness at break 11.2mm; surviving weight 25.9g.



Small butt end fragment of palstave. In side view, the flanges reach the septum approximately 14mm below the butt end and there is some concavity and change of angle in the upper profile. The butt end is wide and angular, with a slightly convex curved top. On both faces of the upper septum, repeated scratch marks are evident and these look relatively recent. The break appears to have occurred in antiquity. The fragment has a dark grey green patination.



2. Palstave butt end fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 29.7mm; butt width 21.3mm; max. thickness at break 11.8mm; surviving weight 26.8g.



Small butt end fragment of a palstave. In side view, the flanges reach the septum approximately 17mm below the butt end and there is little concavity and change of angle in the upper profile. The butt end tapers noticeably in plan view to approximately 21.3mm. There is some damage to the end profile, although it would appear that the butt end had a slightly convex curved top profile. The break appears to have been made in antiquity. The fragment has a light grey green patination with some surface pitting and corrosion evident.



3. Small blade fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 32.7mm; width at breaks 16.5mm & 17.5mm; max. thickness 4.8mm; surviving weight 10.4g.



Small and narrow blade fragment, whose blade has a rounded centre-section. The blade sides are slightly concave. In side view, there is slight bending of the blade near the upper blade break, suggesting forcible breaking of the blade. Some areas of original blade face surfaces have been eroded, while blade edges have pale green powdering. The break surfaces are worn, suggesting the blade was broken in antiquity. The blade fragment has a green-brown patina.



4. Spearhead lower blade fragment



Dimensions: Surviving length 33.0mm; max. surviving width at lower break 26.2mm; maximum thickness at lower break 10.9mm; aperture diameter at lower break 7.5mm; surviving weight 20.7g.



Small lower blade fragment of a spearhead with a rounded midrib. The wide midrib tapers significantly from approximately13mm at lower break to approximately 10mm at the upper break, indicating it is a lower blade fragment. In side-section, there is an oval shaped hollow up the central midrib of the blade (7.6mm wide at lower break and 5.2mm wide at upper break). The blade margins and edges have been eroded away and are absent. In side view, there is pronounced bending towards the upper break, suggesting forcible breaking of the spearhead. Near the lower break on one face, there is a flattening and slight dent, suggesting breakage through impact with an implement of unknown form. The break surfaces are worn, suggesting the spearhead was broken in antiquity. One face is differentially eroded and pitted, with a pale green patina, while the reverse has greater survival of original surfaces and has a dark grey-green patina. The eroded edges are pale green and powdery.



5. Flat plate fragment



Dimensions: Maximum length 23.7mm; maximum width 21.4mm; thickness 4.0mm; surviving weight 8.8g.



Small flat plate fragment. One edge has a bevelled margin, as if it was deliberately shaped and was an upper surface. Very slight, almost imperceptible concavity of the reverse side suggests it may have been an interior surface. On both surfaces, there are slight linear and irregular shaped surface blemishes, showing as slight negative depressions. These are probable irregularities created during the casting process. The break edges of the plate are eroded, suggesting breakage in antiquity. The plate fragment has a dark grey-green patina.



Discussion (by Adam Gwilt)



The two palstave butt fragments (Nos. 1 & 2) may be identified with confidence as either belonging to Transitional palstaves of Middle Bronze Age date or Late palstaves of Late Bronze Age date. The chief discriminating feature between the butts of these two forms is in the shape of the side flange profile. With Transitional palstaves, flanges are highest at the stop and they typically extend in a straight line from stop to butt, to give an elongated lozenge form (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 145-6). Late palstaves, by contrast have short flanges, curving and descending to meet the septum well below the butt (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 158). The distinction however is one of degree: some later Transitional palstaves do have flanges reaching the septum well below the butt, with some concave curvature in the slope evident (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 146). On these two small butt fragments, a clear typological distinction is difficult to make, since both have side flanges which meet the septum some distance below the butt and hinting at a concavity of slope, rather than in a straight line. The wide and square end of one palstave fragment (No. 1) is a tendency more typically viewed on Late palstaves (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, Plates 66-7), however some Transitional palstaves also exhibit similar characteristics. On this morphological evidence, it is difficult to differentiate between later examples of Transitional palstaves or Late palstaves.



The presence of small but deliberately added quantities of lead (1-5%) to the composition of these palstaves is instructive. Metallurgical analysis of Transitional palstaves from Wales and The Marches has indicated a general pattern of unleaded bronze compositions with trace presences (less than 0.1%) of lead in some (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 451-86). By contrast, analyses of Late palstaves from Wales and The Marches show leaded bronze compositions with a range of 1.0-17.5% lead added, and frequently in the range of 1-6% (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 496-545). On this metallurgical evidence, the two palstave butt fragments from Penllyn are consistent with Late palstave compositions and, on a balance of probability, are probably fragments of Late palstaves rather than Transitional palstaves.



Late palstaves were made during the Wilburton and Ewart Park phases of the Late Bronze Age and spanning from 1150 to 800 BC (e.g. Savory 1980, 47; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 162-3; Northover unpublished a, 212, 270, 274-7; Davies & Lynch 2000, 180-7 & Fig. 4.15). In Wales, Late palstaves were included within the Guilsfield hoard of late Wilburton date (e.g. Savory 1980, 117-8, Fig. 32) and they have commonly been found in hoards of Ewart Park date (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 275, 281 & 285 & Figs. 31, 42 & 44; Northover unpublished a, Hoards 3, 28, 63, 68, 74, 108, 114, 130, 134).

The small blade fragment (No. 3), though not definitively diagnostic has two diagnostic features, a narrow blade form combined with a blade with rounded centre section. This is sufficient to exclude the possibility of it belonging to a dagger or knife of Early Bronze Age date (e.g. Gerloff 1975), or a sword blade of Middle to Late Bronze Age date (e.g. Colquhoun & Burgess 1988). This leaves two main possibilities: either a blade fragment from a socketed knife of Late Bronze Age date or a rapier blade fragment of Middle Bronze Age date, possibly from a reworked blade.



The unusually narrow blade width is not frequently paralleled amongst the known examples of socketed knives from Wales (Gwilt et al 2005, 54). However a similar blade width and profile with a rounded centre section is seen on a single example of socketed knife from Minera, Wrexham (Savory 1980, 54, 111, Cat. 224a & Fig. 26; Gwilt et al 2005, 54). This has a blade width of approximately 16.5mm, in comparison with the range of 16.5-17.5mm width on this blade fragment. The Minera knife is of Type Thorndon, a type dating to the Late Bronze Age, with a number of associations in the Ewart Park phase dating to between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Hodges 1956; Coles 1959-60, 46; Needham 1993,44-6 & Fig. 33.10; Gwilt et al 2005, 37 & 54-55, Appendix 2).



Alternatively, this combination of blade features most closely matches one of the later types of Group IV rapiers, such as Type Appleby or Type Stuntney (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 74-84). These belong to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age but continued into the Wilburton phase at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the centuries from 1300 to 1000 BC (Burgess & Gerloff 1981, 106-109). Group IV rapiers are the most common of the British rapier forms and were commonly reworked later during their use lives, often being found as broken and undiagnostic blade fragments. It is possible therefore, that a rapier made towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age could remain in use and circulation into the Late Bronze Age, only being deposited in a hoard then.



The presence of small but deliberately added quantities of lead (1-5%) to the composition of this blade fragment is however instructive in determining between these two possibilities. Metallurgical analysis of nine examples of Middle Bronze Age Group IV rapiers from Wales and The Marches has so far indicated a pattern of unleaded bronze compositions with trace lead presences (less than 0.5%) in some (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 997-1007). Similar analyses of eleven examples of Late Bronze Age socketed knives and reworked knife blades from Wales and The Marches typically show leaded bronze compositions with a range of 2.0-9.5% lead added (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1353-68). This would be in a range consistent with the composition of the blade fragment, suggesting it is probably from a socketed knife of Late Bronze Age date, and not a blade fragment from a Group IV rapier.



The spearhead fragment (No. 4) is part of a lower blade, as evidenced by the size of the internal aperture (7.5mm) along the central rib of the spear at the lower break. No diagnostic features are preserved on this spearhead fragment, to link it to type and secure date. A spearhead with a prominent rounded mid-rib and circular to oval shaped internal aperture is consistent with deriving from a larger side-looped spearhead or basal looped spearhead of Middle Bronze Age date (1500-1150BC), or a pegged spearhead of Late Bronze Age date (1150-800 BC) (e.g. Ehrenberg 1977; Davis 2006; 2012). The spearhead contains a small percentage of deliberately added lead (1-5%), which may be compared with the compositions of other spearheads of side-looped, basal-looped and pegged spearheads from Wales and The Marches. The existing compositional data indicates side-looped and basal-looped spearheads of Middle Bronze Age date contain up to 1.5% lead, though most commonly less than 1% lead (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1111-1161). The plain pegged and lozenge sectioned spearheads of the Late Bronze Age contain a range of 0.6-18.6% lead composition, most commonly in the 1.5-10% range (Northover unpublished b, Analyses 1164-1267). On the basis of metallurgical composition, this spearhead fragment has a lead content most likely to derive from a Late Bronze Age pegged spearhead form.



The bronze plate fragment (No. 5) proves problematic to identify to a known class of finished artefact of Bronze Age date. While its bevelled edge, slightly convex upper surface and slight concavity of the underside suggest the possibility of once belonging to a cast artefact, it exhibits no diagnostic features. However its bronze composition, with a small added component of lead (1-5%) is the same as the composition of the other artefacts and suggests that this piece is probably of contemporary age. Its similar patination, thickness and cast technology all add to this suggestion. Ingot and plate scrap fragments become recognised raw material components of hoards during the Late Bronze Age. The Guilsfield, Powys hoard contains many fragments cast plate fragments of leaded bronze (Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268, Fig. 38). It is possible therefore, that this plate fragment represents a bi-product of the bronze casting process; a piece of bronze available for recycling and casting into a finished object.



The dating of all the artefact types present in this scatter suggests a probable date during the Wilburton or Ewart Park periods of the Late Bronze Age, spanning from 1150 to 800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). Typological attribution has been considerably aided by semi-quantitative analyses of the metallurgical compositions of these artefacts and their comparison with existing quantitative data from known Bronze Age metalwork from Wales and The Marches. Small, but deliberate additions of lead to the bronze in all cases, have tipped identifications of these highly fragmentary pieces in favour of known Late Bronze Age possible types and away from Middle Bronze Age possibilities. These similar compositional signatures are consistent with the artefacts being of contemporary date when deposited.



Given their tight spatial clustering within a 50m area of a field and the presence of multiple artefacts of contemporary date, it is felt that, on a balance of probability and given the evidence available, these artefacts were once probably buried together as a hoard group, and therefore may be regarded as treasure. It is probable that the artefacts had been disturbed in recent times on this shallow soil onto bedrock, possibly through spike harrowing or ploughing of marginal land during the Second World War. The finder reported also discovering modern agricultural harrow spikes of iron within the field where the artefacts were reported. It is possible that further artefacts or artefact fragments remain to be discovered in this field and were also once part of the same hoard. The association of Late palstaves, knife and spearhead in this hoard group and the highly fragmented character of artefacts reported, make its composition and character unusual for south east Wales. Here, most Ewart Park hoards are dominated by socketed axes of the South Wales type (e.g. McNeil 1973; Moore 1978; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004), while complete or near complete artefacts are usually present in addition to fragmentary objects.","Metallurgical Analysis (by Mary Davis)



Qualitative surface analysis of the objects within the hoard was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6µA for 100 live seconds. Surface analysis is susceptible to distortions due to the asymmetry of whole objects (rather that flat polished samples). Surface corrosion can lead to the surface enrichment (e.g. tin) and depletion (e.g. zinc) of elements; lead is often unevenly distributed within copper alloys. These factors can affect the quantities of copper and tin, lead and zinc analysed on the surface of an object.



Results



All objects are of bronze with relatively small quantities of lead deliberately added (above 1%, and probably less than 5% lead). The quantities of major elements vary, and the trace elements show different patterns of presence/absence.



The consistent and deliberate addition of small quantities of lead to these tin bronze objects provides evidence in support of their contemporary date. Specifically, it helps to demonstrate that the flat plate fragment (No. 5 above) has a composition consistent with the other artefacts in the group. The deliberate addition of lead to bronze within the casting process is first witnessed during the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Northover 1980; 1982; unpublished a, 205). For these fragmentary artefacts, which are not entirely diagnostic to type and date, this leaded bronze metallurgical composition provides evidence in support of a Late Bronze Age date, rather than a Middle Bronze Age date.

1. Ribbed socketed axe - South Wales Type socketed axe



Dimensions: surviving length 87.1mm; surviving blade width 44.6mm; surviving weight 156.8g.



This is a socketed axe with a damaged and largely absent mouth and damage to the blade end and lower side caused by erosion, lamination and detachment of the original surfaces from the core. The axe has a narrow and out-splayed mouth moulding, the top too damaged to observe its original shape or evidence for runner stubs. The axe is sub-rectangular in section with rounded face edges. The loop is absent, though two scars indicate the loop was high but descended from beneath the moulding. From the underside of the moulding on both faces, three ribs descend over three quarters of the length of the faces. Though largely parallel with each other, they curve slightly and converge slightly towards the blade end. Casting seams are visible down both sides, though they have been hammered down or filed. The blade end is too damaged to observe whether it was prepared for use. The axe has a brown patination and break edges are unstable and laminating in places.



2. Plain slender socketed axe fragment - unidentifiable to type



Dimensions: surviving length 84.4mm; surviving blade width 34.1mm; surviving weight 112.1g.



This is the blade and body of a plain slender socketed axe, missing its mouth end. The sides are near parallel with no evidence of recurving at the blade end. The surfaces are eroded, however there is no evidence of rib decoration on the upper blade and the face edges are rounded. The axe has a sub-rectangular cross-section. The loop is missing, though a pair of eroded scars are evident on one side. The blade edge, although eroded, exhibits a marked asymmetry, probably through repeated use and re-sharpening. The axe has a brown patination and the mouth breaks are unstable. There is surface cracking evident on one mid-face, suggesting surfaces are unstable and laminating.



3. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - unidentifiable to type



Dimensions: surviving length 76.8mm; surviving blade width 31.2mm; surviving weight 28.0g.



This is a highly eroded blade and side fragment of a slender socketed axe. The side of the axe is near straight and shows no recurving at the blade end. The narrow blade suggests a slender axe and the blade end is slightly assymetric, possibly through use and re-sharpening. The feint projecting line a possible linear rib can just be traced on the eroded axe face, suggesting that this was once a ribbed form of socketed axe. The loop is missing, however one loop scar is evident just beneath the side break, suggesting the axe was originally in the range of 100-110mm long. An apparent gently curved protrusion near the face edge has been created through differential erosion of the axe surfaces, the socket wall behind it being even and undistorted. All faces and breaks are highly eroded and the axe has a green patination.



4. Socketed axe fragment - undiagnostic



Dimensions: surviving length 59.3mm; surviving blade width 37.8mm; surviving weight 65.2g.



This is the highly eroded blade end fragment of a socketed axe. The sides are straight and parallel with no evidence of recurving at the blade end. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section. Insufficient of the axe faces survive to tell whether the axe was plain or had ribbed decoration. On one face, there is evidence of deliberate impact in antiquity with a sharp pointed tool or weapon, which has punctured and deformed the socket wall inwards in two places. The original axe surfaces are largely eroded and removed and the axe has a brown patination.



5. Socketed tool fragment - undiagnostic



Dimensions: surviving length 39.9mm; maximum surviving width 25.2mm; maximum thickness 12.5mm; surviving weight 20.3g.



This is a small highly eroded socket base and face fragment of a socketed tool of uncertain form. In side-section, the faces are tapering towards the blade end. The linear socket base and surviving width of the object suggest a narrow and flat bladed socketed tool - perhaps a socketed knife or a very slender axe. There is no moulding or change of slope evident on the surface to indicate a socket to blade transition. The lower breaks are extremely eroded, while the upper socket wall is laminating. Surface cracking and lamination is evident on one face and side. The artefact has a brown patination.



6. Jet - two runner form



Dimensions: top surface length 27.9mm; top surface width 23.9mm; maximum height 19.6mm; weight 24.6g.



This is an oval shaped jet of conical form. The upper surface is uneven and has a radial cooling pattern. The underside tapers, taking the contours of the top of the clay mould. Two runners extend beyond the base of the reservoir and are elongate oval in shape, (8.8mm long and 4.5mm wide and 6.5 by 3.8mm in size at root). At one point, an irregular bronze protrusion extends sideways, once infilling a small cavity in the top of the mould. The jet has a green patination, although an area of the underside has a dark blue-grey patina. This artefact appears fresh and unworn.



Discussion (by Adam Gwilt)



One of the socketed axes in this group (No. 1) may be confidently identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over thirty hoards now contain at least 140 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



A second axe may be tentatively identified as a ribbed socketed axe (No. 3), but undiagnostic to type. Hoards containing multiple associations of South Wales Type socketed axes are common in south east Wales. Further types of ribbed socketed axes are also known and are also common components within Late Bronze Age hoards of Ewart Park date in Wales. These are variously known as Southern English/Welby Type ribbed axes, Yorkshire Type axes, Croxton Type axes, Llanarth Type axes and Breiddin Type axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-39; Needham 1990, 32-38; Northover unpublished, 267).



The presence of a plain socketed axe of slender form (No. 2) may also be discerned, however the absence of a mouth precludes certain identification to type. However, its slender proportions, lack of facets and sub-rectangular cross-section help to rule out many plain and all faceted types, while tending to point towards the axe belonging to a Class A South-eastern type socketed axe (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 212-7; Needham 1990, 28-31; Northover unpublished, Cats. 624-53). When found in hoards in Britain, they are almost exclusively dated to the Ewart Park/Carp's Tongue phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 216-7; Needham 1990, 30).



The axe blade fragment (No. 4), although not identifiable to type, did belong to a socketed axe. Socketed axes are a diagnostic artefact form of the Late Bronze Age, with the overwhelming majority made and buried at this time. While a few exceptional examples are known in the Middle Bronze Age and certain forms continued to be made and used into the Earliest Iron Age, the vast majority known in Wales and Britain belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. O'Connor 1980, 161 & 225; Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Gwilt 2004; Northover unpublished, 237-90). Therefore, the association of such an undiagnostic blade fragment is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard of Ewart Park date (1000-800 BC).



The socketed tool fragment (No. 5) is not identifiable to artefact type. Its narrow dimensions and narrow, linear socket base suggest either the mid blade fragment of a slender or small socketed axe, or perhaps the socket to upper blade interface of a socketed knife. The seeming absence of a step between the socket and upper blade and the lack of evidence for a perforation through the wall of the socket are factors suggesting that this socket fragment does not have dimensions entirely typical of Type Thorndon or Type Dungiven socketed knives (Hodges 1956; Gwilt et al 2005, 54-5). However, it is possible that this may have belonged to a knife with a particularly long socket or not entirely conforming to typical characteristics. Socketed axes of small size or very slender form, possessing narrow sockets and narrow blade widths do exist within the overall range of sizes and dimensions of socketed axes known in Britain and Ireland (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981; Pearce 1983; Eogan 2000; Northover unpublished). The width of this socket is particularly slender and implying an axe with a blade width in the range of 25-35mm. Very small or slender socketed axes may be of plain, faceted or ribbed types. It is likely that many had a specialist function, as distinct from the more common and general purpose axes.



The jet of two runner form (No. 6) is the excess reservoir of metal at the top of a mould and a bi-product of the casting process. Jets are commonly incorporated into hoards during the Late Bronze Age, yet are rarely present within hoards of Early and Middle Bronze Age date. Examples with between one and four runners are known. This relatively small example with two runners could have been used to cast a socketed axe, a spearhead or a socketed tool.

The South Wales Type axe (No. 1) and jet (No. 6) are diagnostic artefacts which may be dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age spanning from 1000 BC to 800 BC (Needham 1996; Needham et al 1997). The less diagnostic artefact fragments belong to classes of artefacts that are also consistent with this Ewart Park date. The range of possible artefact types suggested have been found in association with socketed axes of South Wales Type and within hoards of Ewart Park date in Wales.



The account of the discovery indicates that the artefacts were found buried at significant depth beneath the surface and closely clustered together. The artefacts were retrieved from four adjacent and deep detector pits, however no archaeological burial context, such as a pit, was observed by the finder. On the basis of this evidence, a hoard of directly associated artefacts can be confirmed. The finder indicated that the find-spot was within a boggy and uncultivated field, speculating that the hoard may have been buried in an ancient pond or within a river bed. Today, springs do issue into small stream channels in the immediate vicinity of the finds and in this boggy area, although the extent to which drainage patterns may have changed during the post-Medieval period through mining and quarrying is not fully known. This specific watery landscape locality may have been deliberately selected for the deposition of the hoard as a gift to the gods (Gwilt 2004, 121; Gwilt et al 2013, 11).","References

1. South Wales Type socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 77.4mm; mouth dimensions 50.1 x 37.7mm (external; surviving weight 203.2g.



This is a large mouth and body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe, whose blade end is entirely missing. The axe has a narrow and out-splayed mouth moulding, with three of four runner stubs visible on the upper mouth surface. The axe is rectangular in section with angled face edges. The loop is complete, descending from beneath the base of the mouth moulding. Three prominent ribs descend from the underside of the moulding on both sides, converging slightly towards the lower blade end. The ribs are discontinuous in places, suggesting imperfections in the mould, possibly through re-use. Prominent casting seams are visible down each side and appear to have been rapidly hammered down. The internal flashes inside the loop remain prominent and unfiled. The axe was poorly cast, possibly within a misaligned or ill-fitting three-part mould, with one side markedly thicker than the other, the wall being very thin on one face and side along the break. The break appears to have been made in antiquity and both faces have been dented near the break through impact with a blunt ended object, thereby narrowing the socket aperture at the break end. The axe has a green patination over undamaged surfaces. Recent damage is evident along the thin walled face and side, which has removed a rib and the upper surface, through a side shearing action with a blade. This has created a hole and fissure in the side wall, while the damaged surfaces have a light green patination.



2. Plain slender socketed axe



Dimensions: length 93.1mm; surviving blade width 39.7mm; external mouth dimensions: side to side 38.6mm, front to back 38.6mm; weight 153.7g.



This is a complete plain and slender socketed axe with a single and flared mouth moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped cross section with rounded face edges. The axe has a deep front to back socket, its mouth being sub-square in shape. A small and wide loop descends from the underside of the mouth flaring. Casting seams are visible down each side, having been partially hammered or filed down, but still projecting in places. The sides of the axe are slightly divergent and concave, flaring slightly at the blade end. The blade edge appears slightly assymetric in shape, deeper at the loop side. Striations parallel with the cutting edge indicate it was sharpened for use. The axes has a green to dark green patination, with small areas of light green powdery surface on damaged blade and around the mouth.



3. Plain socketed axe fragments (6) - Class A, South Eastern Type



Dimensions: surviving length 49.8mm; external mouth dimensions: side to side 41.6mm; combined surviving weight of fragments 63.1g; surviving weight of large fragment 52.2g.



This is a partial mouth end fragment of a plain socketed axe with a double mouth moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped cross section with rounded face edges. The axe has a sub-rectangular shaped mouth. It is estimated that the front-back mouth dimension was in the range of 37-40mm, giving it a comparatively deep mouth and socket. A wide loop descends from the lower mouth moulding. The axe appears relatively wide in form, with divergent but straight upper sides, suggesting this was once a sizeable socketed axe. Untrimmed casting seams are visible down both sides. Two small fragments of mouth and lower mouth moulding were discovered pushed into the socket of the axe and these breaks are soil covered and appear to be ancient, suggesting the axe was deliberately damaged in antiquity. It is possible that the reverse face was also damaged in antiquity, as evidenced through a tear and in-turned break. A further three small axe wall fragments were retrieved at the time of discovery. The presence of fresh breaks on these and on one lower face of the larger fragment suggest this damage was caused during recent retrieval from the ground. A casting seam crack is evident on the non-loop side, probably caused by ancient or recent impact and deformation to the axe. The axe has a grey green patination, with small areas of light green powdery patination near breaks and around the top of the mouth.



4. Plain Pegged Spearhead, with elliptical leaf-shaped blade (2 fragments)



Dimensions: combined surviving length of large blade fragment and socket fragment c. 174.0mm; surviving maximum blade width 48.6mm; combined surviving weight (including concretion inside socket)135.5g.



A Plain Pegged spearhead, with a lanceolate leaf-shaped blade, broken below the base of the blade insertion. The spearhead midrib shows a marked angularity or ridge along its central length on both faces, giving its external cross-section a sub-lozengic shape at the break. The blade has a bevel 4-4.5mm wide, though only now surviving near the base of the blade and in one localised place along the upper blade, have been partially worn away over much of its length. The blade surfaces have many longitudinal striations parallel with the line of the midrib, suggesting the blade was prepared and sharpened in antiquity. A socket fragment conjoins on one face with the main blade and exhibits a continuing curved ridge, as witnessed down the midrib. An amorphous copper alloy concretion is wedged inside the socket of the spearhead. The spearhead has a grey green patination over most surfaces, although one face is differentially eroded with patches of light green corrosion evident. The tip and blade edges also have a light green patination along much of their length.



5. Lunate-opening spearhead, with leaf-shaped blade (2 fragments)



Dimensions: combined surviving length of large blade fragment and socket fragment c. 179.0mm; surviving length of blade (tip to base) approx. 117.0mm; surviving blade width 53.8mm; combined surviving weight 118.6g.



This is a leaf-shaped spearhead fragment with lunate-openings, with a missing spear tip and also broken just below the base of the blade insertion. The spearhead has an angled ridge down the centre of the blade, giving a lozenge-sectioned upper blade and hexagonal central cross-section on the lower blade, where the lunate openings occur. The angled ridge extends down the upper socket to give the socket here a sub-lozengic cross-section. The blade appears to have been widest below its mid-point and of probable lanceolate leaf-shaped form. The lunate openings are long and wide, in proportion to the blade length, and the spearhead is hollow-bladed, as best viewed along the upper blade break. The blade itself probably once extended a further 50-60mm to give a total blade length of around 150-170mm. The blade has a bevel 5.0-5.5mm wide near its base, though is heavily eroded along middle and upper blade sections. A small rectangular hole is evident in the inner wall of one of the lunate openings, while there is modern damage on one face near the upper break. A socket fragment conjoins with the large blade fragment, extending the combined surviving length to 179.0mm. A side ridge extends from the base of the blade to the point of the peg-hole, whose edge is 21-22.0mm from the base of the blade. Though incomplete and now eroded, this peg-hole appears to have been 5-6mm in diameter and there is a similar concave edge curvature at the same level on the opposing side of the socket. The spearhead has a grey green patination, with localised areas of light green corrosion at blade edges and breaks.



6. Small spearhead socket fragment (probably part of lunate-opening spearhead 5)



Dimensions: maximum surviving length 18.0mm; maximum surviving width 11.7mm; wall thickness 0.9-1.2mm; surviving weight 0.8g.



This is a small socket fragment, found within the backfill of the detector pit, when the find-spot was subsequently investigated. Its thickness and curvature is consistent with the incomplete sockets of the two spearheads in the hoard. The breaks are soil covered and not apparently freshly made. Attempts to re-fit the fragment have not yielded a certain clean join, however it is very probable that this fragment once belonged to the socket of the lunate opening spearhead (No. 5 above). On one side of this fragment is an even concave curve, suggesting part of the aperture of a peg-hole. This is consistent with a peg-hole of 6mm in size, similar to that observed on the conjoining socket fragment of the lunate-opening spearhead. The fragment has a grey-green patination.



7. 'Copper alloy' amorphous drib fragment



Dimensions: maximum length 37.5mm; maximum width 12.9mm; maximum height 11.6mm; weight 5.6g.



This is a small amorphous 'copper alloy' drib fragment, exhibiting no sign of shaping into an artefact form. It is possible that this represents the excess bi-product of a casting or metalworking event, or alternatively, was once an artefact that was heated to a very high temperature and molten state. The possible underside of the fragment has a very uneven surface, taking the contours of the uneven surface on which it lay or landed on. One end of the reverse face has a rounded convex and smooth surface, with two small protrusions, indicating cooling and solidifying from molten state. At the opposite end of the upper surface, there is a thickening of the metal, which projects upwards unevenly. Here, the metal contains holes or vesicles, suggesting bubbling when the metal cooled and solidified.




Metallurgical Analysis of the copper alloy fragment (Mary Davis)



Qualitative surface analysis of the copper alloy fragment (No. 6 above) was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. There was no surface preparation of the artefacts; the relatively high kV setting deployed would have allowed penetration of the X-rays through corrosion layers, and resulting spectra could be compared with those from similar artefacts, but would not allow for the production of quantitative data.



Results



The 'copper alloy' fragment was revealed to be a zinc alloy, containing at least 90% zinc, plus a small amount of copper. Alloys containing significant quantities of zinc are not found in Britain until the Late Iron Age, when brass containing up to c. 27% zinc was first introduced as a copper-zinc alloy (Bayley 1998, 13). Metallic zinc was not isolated in Europe until the post-medieval period; the composition of this piece strongly suggests a date within the last 100-200 years. It could be the bi-product of a metal casting event or the result of the heating of a zinc artefact (melting point 420oC), causing it to become molten and lose its original form.



Identification and Discussion (Adam Gwilt, Mark Lodwick & Mary Davis)



One of the socketed axes in this group (No. 1) may be confidently identified as of South Wales Type, dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards across south east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, approaching forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



The plain slender socketed axe (No. 2) is difficult to identify to a widespread type, although the absence of any mouth moulding or collar precludes many recognised types. In combination, the slender form with flaring mouth, sub-rectangular section and deep mouth plan, with slightly concave divergent sides and modest blade expansion, are most closely paralleled with Class 5 plain socketed axes from Ireland (Eogan 2000, 42-5, Cats. 201-25 & Pls. 11-12) or the miscellaneous slender socketed axes with rectangular bodies provisionally grouped together within Scotland and northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 217-8, Cats. 1295-1303, Pl. 86). They have been found associated within hoards of Ewart Park / Dowris date (1000-800 BC) in Britain and Ireland, although an earlier origin within the preceding Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-950 BC) is suspected but remains unproven (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 218; Eogan 2000, 45). In Wales, a plain socketed axe of similar form has been found within a hoard at Margam Beach, Neath-Port Talbot, beside two other plain socketed axes and a South Wales type ribbed socketed axe (Wear unpublished; Northover unpublished, Hoard 76). This hoard is dated to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC).



The mouth fragment and accompanying small fragments of the second plain socketed axe (No. 3) may be confidently identified as of Class A - South-eastern Type (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 212-7; Needham 1990, 28-31; Northover unpublished, Cats. 624-53). This form is characterised by a double mouth-moulding, of which the upper moulding is the more prominent, with the lower giving rise to the loop on one side, with a sub-rectangular body section, squarish mouth and plain non-faceted faces. When found in hoards in Britain, they are almost exclusively dated to the Ewart Park/Carp's Tongue phase of the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 216-7; Needham 1990, 30). In south-east Wales, Class A - South-eastern Type socketed axes are repeated presences within hoards of this same date, with single examples present in the Tal-y-garn (1&2) (Rhondda Cynon Taf), Margam Beach (Neath-Port Talbot), Llantwit Major, Pendoylan (both Vale of Glamorgan), Glascoed (Monmouthshire) and Myddfai (Carmarthenshire) hoards (e.g. Storrie 1887; GGAT 1977-8; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, 121, Cat. 281 & Fig. 42; 1984, 441; Briggs & Williams 1995;Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1. 3; Northover unpublished, H 38,74, 76, 79; Wear unpublished).



One of the spearheads (No. 4) may be identified as a Plain Pegged Spearhead with a leaf shaped blade. Pegged spearheads, as an artefact class, generally span from the second half of the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard (Swansea), Guilsfield (Powys) and Princetown (Blaenau Gwent) hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150 BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920 BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800 BC. In Wales, there are currently thirteen other known hoards of Ewart Park date which include Plain Pegged spearhead associations: the Ty Mawr (Anglesey), Llandderfel (Gwynedd), Llantysilio (Denbighshire), Pant-y-Maen, Manorbier (both Pembrokeshire), St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Llantwit Major, Cowbridge (both Vale of Glamorgan), St Fagans (Cardiff), Llantarnam (Torfaen), Llangwm, Glascoed and Llanvihangel Gobion (all Monmouthshire) hoards (Barnwell 1864; Williams 1877; Davies 1929, 368; Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 240; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273 & 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1, Nos. 1, 3 & 9; Lynch 1991, 246-9 & Fig. 69; Northover unpublished, H4, 53, 74, 85,108, 121, 141; Gwilt & Lodwick 2011; unpublished; Gwilt et al, 2011a; 2011b). The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age dating to between 1000 BC and 800 BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3; Needham et al 1997, 93-8).



The second spearhead (No. 5) may be identified as a leaf-shaped Pegged Spearhead with Lunate-openings. This artefact class was first developed during the second half of the Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1050-950 BC), being present within hoards of this date from Wilburton (Cambridgeshire), Blackmoor (Hampshire) and Guilsfield (Powys) (Burgess et al 1972, 214; Savory 1965; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Figs. 32-8). However, they flourished within the later Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC), becoming one of the type fossils within the Broadward Complex of large spearhead dominated warrior hoards whose distribution extends across the Marches, into south-west England, across central southern England and into East Anglia and Yorkshire (Burgess et al 1972, 221, 230-5, Fig. 1c; Northover unpublished, 247).



In looking at the overall composition of the hoard, the combination of spearheads and axes suggests an intermediate position between the spearhead dominated warrior hoards of the Broadward tradition and the axes, tools and casting bi-products defining most Late Bronze Age hoards of the Llantwit-Stogursey tradition across south-east Wales and the Carp's Tongue tradition across southern England. Metalwork with Broadward Complex affinities is not abundant in Wales, the evidence currently comprising the Pant-y-Maen (Pembrokeshire) spearhead hoard (Griffiths 1957; Burgess et al 1972, 232 & 240), the Princetown (Blaenau Gwent) spearhead pair (Savory 1972; 1980, 119 & 188, Cat. 272, Fig. 40; Green & Northover 1981; Gwilt 2004, 115-6, Appendix 1.2, Fig. 5.1) and a single barbed spearhead, now lost from Pendoylan (Burgess et al 1972, 232; Savory 1984, 441; Northover unpublished 251).



The amorphous 'copper alloy' (No. 7) was analysed and discovered to be a zinc alloy, comprising over 90% zinc and a small amount of copper. Technologically it cannot be of Late Bronze Age date and it very probably dates to recent times, and is certainly post-medieval or later. Therefore, it cannot be deemed to be directly associated with and buried beside the other five Late Bronze Age artefacts in this hoard.","References

805657,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1750,-1500,"Early Bronze Age hoard of three axes.



1. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 118.3mm; surviving blade width 63.7mm; surviving weight 266.7g.



This is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and very slightly divergent towards the blade end and the sides curve out suddenly to a widely expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The butt end is damaged, making it impossible to tell whether it was straight ended or arched. Approximately 57mm from the butt end, there is a low stopridge across both faces. The flanges, although now damaged, would have risen approximately 3mm above the septum on each face. The blade edge is damaged and fragile, making it difficult to accurately determine the original blade width. On one face, just below the stopridge, the feint traces of decorative hammer marks can be observed, forming three or four linear zones parallel with the stopridge. Hammer marks are also evident along the sides of the axe, though forming no distinct faceting or patterning. On the recurving side of one blade edge, a number of impact marks are present, suggesting use wear. On one upper septum face, there is a patch of green corrosion product. The overall patination is green, although the damaged blade edge, flanges, butt end and stop-ridge have a blue green colouration. These edges are fragile and powdery.



2. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 119.0mm; surviving blade width 68.1mm; surviving weight 223.0g.



This is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and near parallel, the lower sides curving out to a cutting edge that is widely expanded and with a crescentic blade edge. The butt end is damaged, however there is curvature in the remaining edge, suggesting the butt was originally arched. Approximately 51mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges, though partly damaged, rise approximately 2.0mm above the septum on both sides. The blade edge is damaged and fragile and the surviving blade width is less than the original blade width. The sides are hammer faceted into three facets, with cable hammer decoration evident. The overall patination is green-brown in colour, while damaged blade edge, butt end and flanges have a lighter blue-green colouration. The damaged surfaces are fragile and powdery.



3. Long-flanged axe (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 113.5mm; surviving blade width 57.5mm; surviving weight 199.8g.



This is a largely complete bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and slightly divergent towards the blade end, the lower sides curving out to a cutting edge that is widely expanded and with a crescentic blade edge. The butt end is damaged, making it impossible to determine whether the butt end was arched. Approximately 47.5mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges, though damaged, are estimated to have risen approximately 2.0mm above the septum on both sides. The blade edge is damaged and fragile, making it difficult to determine the original blade width. The sides are hammer faceted into three facets. On one side, feint cable hammer decoration can still be observed within the middle facet. It is probable that similar decoration, originally on the other side, has now worn away. On one face, a large patch of blue corrosion can be observed. The axe has a green brown coloured patination, while the damaged blade edge, butt end, flanges and corrosion patches on one face have a lighter blue-green colouration. The damaged surfaces are fragile and powdery.



Identification and Discussion (Adam Gwilt)



These three axes may all be identified as Class 5 long-flanged axes belonging to the Arreton - Ebnal-Inch Island/Gavel Moss phase (Period 4, Metalwork Assemblage VI) of the Early Bronze Age (e.g. Northover unpublished, 104-13; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-5; Needham et al 1985, iii; Needham 1996, 132-3; Rohl & Needham 1998, 91-2). They are contemporary with the Wessex 2 rich grave tradition and Camerton-Snowshill dagger and knife series across southern Britain, now independently radiocarbon dated to 1750/1700-1500 BC (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 179-80; Needham & Woodward 2008, 7, Fig. 3; Needham et al 2010, 364-5 & Table 1; Woodward & Hunter 2015, 462).



One of the flanged axes (No. 1 above) is typologically slightly different to the other two, having a stopridge, rather than a median bevel, being notably thicker in casting and having more prominent cast flanges. Unfortunately, the butt end is damaged, making it impossible to tell whether the butt end was originally straight, as predicted for this type. This shows similarities with Type Balbirnie long-flanged axes of Scotland and with some of the axes included within Type Derryniggin flanged axes of Ireland (e.g. Harbison 1969, 55-66, Pls. 69-78; Burgess & Cowen 1972, 178-9; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-2, Cats. 396-407A; Northover unpublished, 112). This flanged axe would seem to exhibit characteristics more similar to the Inch Island / Gavel Moss metalworking tradition of Ireland and Scotland (e.g. Burgess 1980, 122; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 71-2), although it would also fit within the metrical parameters of a Class 5Da axe (Needham 1983, 198-250). Its more pronounced flanges (RHF of 0.0314) suggest that it could be typologically slightly more developed than the other two flanged axes in the hoard.



Two flanged axes (Nos. 2 & 3 above) exhibit very similar attributes: a more slender form, with median bevels, low cast flanges, hammer faceting and hammer cable decoration on their sides. These best correlate with Type Arreton long-flanged axes most densely distributed across southern, eastern and south-western England (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 176-8, Figs. 6 & 7; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 72-5, Cats. 408-25B; Needham 1985; Needham et al 1985, iii; Northover unpublished Cats. 95-108). When the critical measurements for these flanged axes are applied within Needham's metrical classification of Class 5 axes for central and southern Britain (Needham 1983, 198-250), both appear to fit within the parameters of Class 5Da axes, while their relative flange heights, at 0.0216 and 0.0225, sit within the lower range for true Class 5 flanged axes (Needham 1983, 65-6 & 198, Figs. 72-6).



In Wales and The Marches, two published hoards of broadly comparable date and containing Arreton type, Class 5 long-flanged axes are the Menai Bridge, Anglesey and Ebnal, Shropshire hoards (Chitty 1940; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Savory 1946; 1980, 115, Cats. 259-60 & Figs. 18 & 29; Needham 1983, 300-13, Fig. 48.1; Lynch 1991, 218-21 & Fig. 60; Northover unpublished, 106-8, H. 7 & 164). Unfortunately, in each case, many of the artefacts reported in the hoards, both discovered during the nineteenth century, have been lost: there are only three of eight axes surviving in the Menai Bridge hoard (single axes now at Bangor Museum, Amgueddfa Cymru and The British Museum) while only one of three axes originally in the Ebnal hoard survives (Savory 1980, 115 & Cat. 260.3, Fig. 29). A further Arreton hoard with flanged axe fragments has very recently been reported from Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (Treasure Case 15.03), but has yet to be studied and reported upon in detail.



Two of the flanged axes (Nos. 2 & 3) were found in direct association, while the third was found approximately 3-4m away from the other two. The discovery of all three axes at significant depths of approximately 0.46m beneath the surface is unusual, especially if one is to interpret that the three axes were originally buried together in direct association as a hoard, but dispersed through recent agricultural activity. Commonly, dispersed hoards are discovered at shallower depths, with dispersed artefacts found within shallower ploughsoil, rather than at depth. A number of tenable possibilities can be offered, to explain this. Firstly, it is possible that the hoard was disturbed in antiquity, only to be covered by deep clay soil deposits. Secondly, the hoard may have been disturbed in recent times, only to be recently covered during depression infilling events by the landowner with overlying soil deposit. Thirdly, it is possible that the hoard could have been disturbed at depth by the cutting of deep drainage channels, with one axe being dragged and moved along the line of the drain.



Finally, it is possible that tentative attempts may have been made to deep plough this area of marginal land, leading to disturbance of the hoard. In addition, it has been shown that the three flanged axes all date to exactly the same Arreton phase of the Early Bronze Age, and could all have been used and deposited at the same time. These axes are relatively rare discoveries in Wales, with only around twenty examples known to date from hoards and as single finds (e.g. Needham 1983, Figs. 224-31; Northover unpublished, 105, Cats. 95-108). It seems unlikely that a third example of closely similar form and date would be buried separately and as a single find at the same place. Therefore, overall, and on a balance of probability given the available evidence, it is felt probable that the third flanged axe was once buried in direct association with the other two and as part of a single hoard group.","References

806523,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1250,"Dr Peter Chowne writes: a complete cast copper-alloy developed side-looped spearhead that can be assigned to Davis Group 6A (Davis, 2012). The terminology used below follows that of Davis. Although complete there is some damage to the blade both ancient and modern, probably the result of agricultural activity. Surface colour is predominantly dark brown some of the damaged areas have green corrosion. The tip of a wooden shaft survives within the socket. Length: 125 mm, Width: 26 mm, D; 72 mm, Weight: 67.1 g. The blade is flame-shaped with a low (25%) 'Position of Maximum Width' and slightly concave blade edges. The blade surface is flat with a distinct bevel to the blade edges. It has a long midrib with a circular cross-section. The socket base aperture is 19 mm at the widest point. Loop plates have been modified after casting and are lozenge-shaped. Grooves left by sharpening are visible on the bevels and edges of the blade. There are clear indications of working around the loops in the form of striations made by an abrasive tool such as a file.



Type 6A have a number of distribution concentrations the main ones being the Thames Valley and East Anglian fenland. There is a secondary distribution in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Northumberland and eastern Scotland. Spearheads of this type have been found in Lincolnshire at Digby (Daubney 2010), Temple Bruer (Vine, 1987) and Tetford (Davey, 1973). The Digby example most closely resembles this spearhead from Woolsthorpe by Belvoir. There is a similar example on display in Yorkshire Museum. The provenance is 'Yorks"" and it is slightly larger and heavier than the Woolsthorpe spearhead (Davis, 2012, 16 no. 224; Radley, 1967).



Group 6 spearheads are most likely to date to the Taunton metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age (1400-1250 cal BC) although the earliest examples may date to the late stages of the preceding Acton Park phase. Dating is based primarily on hoard associations.

813624,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An incomplete copper alloy Socketed Axehead of probably the Late Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1000 - BC 800.



Around 50% of the axehead is present, consisting of the body and part of the blade. Some of the blade and the top, and handle of the object are missing presumed lost in antiquity.



The object is broadly rectangular in plan and rectangular in section. The top has been broken and object has been pinched or squashed together, giving a concave appearance on both sides of the axe. The object is hollow. The remains of a loop are present on the left side of the object at the top and it appears there is a join where the handle meets the body. The object may have some decoration in the form of two U shaped grooves towards the top of the axe, however this is difficult to see clearly and could possibly be post depositional damage. The sides of the object taper in, forming an arc on either side, then flare slightly to form the cutting edge or blade. The blade is damaged and part is missing, the blade tapers to a point at the base of the object. This has been damaged, and a distinct cutting edge is missing.



The object measures 51.7 mm in length and is 38.7 mm wide at the top of the object and the blade is 35.6 mm wide. It has a maximum thickness, at the top of the object of 9.9 mm. Where the axe has been pinched the thickness is 5.2 mm and the blade is 5.8 mm thick. It weighs 66.3 g.



The object is a mid green in colour with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. Broadly similar axes have been recorded in Schmidt (1981), Plate 72 - 75, however diagnostics are difficult due to damage.



EDIT:



Peter Reavill suggests that this is possibly a worn and damged Irish imported, Faceted Axe, type Gillespie sometimes known as 'baggy axe'. It has been discovered in associated with the late Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase XI) and the Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). This corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 6-7 circa 1000-700 CAL. BC. For an example see HESH-05A063. 



From HESH-05A063: This axe is an unusual find in Shropshire whose known distribution focuses on ribbed axes. This type of faceted axe is therefore rare and its presence important. This axe is of a type which is known as Type Gillespie, which Burgess and Schmidt suggest is associated with later Wilburton metalworking traditions (phase X) and Ewart Park tradition (phase XII). They are also discovered in Oreland and are associated with the Dowris tradition. It has been suggested that this form of facet axe continues production into the Llyn Fawr tradition (which is the transitional period between the metalwork of the Bronze and Iron Ages. Similar axes have been illustrated in Burgess and Schmidt and the best parallels are cat no 1109 Grahams Mount, Midlothian, 1112 Hatton, Angus, and 1121 Stanton Quarry, Furness, Lancs. A more local example can be see in the Savory Welsh catalogue from a small hoard of axes discovered at Llandaff, Glamorganshire (cat no 282). This final Welsh axe had been analysed and the metal content was comparable with axes from the second phase of the Late Bronze Age (LBA II) which Savory dates 750-600 BCbut would actually be better described as Ewart Park 950-750 BC).

814440,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"An incomplete fragment from a socketed axehead, of Late Bronze Age dating (c. 950 BC to c. 750 BC).



Less than 25% of the socketed axehead is present, and consists of part of the mouth and body. The rest is missing, presumed lost in antiquity,



The mouth may have originally been square in shape, as the fragment exhibits an almost right angle bend. The mouth has a rolled rim. The start of two ribs are present on the body.



It measures 21.3 mm in length, 28.2 mm wide and 6.5 mm thick (at the mouth), 3.4 mm thick (body). It weighs 11.6 g.



The socketed axehead fragment is mostly a dark green colour, with the odd light green patch. These lighter areas should be monitored for signs of active copper corrosion (bronze disease) occuring, which exhibitis as a bright green powdery residue. To reduce the risk of this happening, the fragment should be stored in a sealed airtight dry box (such as a tupperware box with a liquid seal), with plenty of silica gel.



Too little is present of this socketed axehead to determine what type it was, but it is definitely of Late Bronze Age dating (c. 950 BC to c. 750 BC).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-10-21T23:00:00Z,2016-10-21T23:00:00Z,,,11.6,,,6.5,21.3,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Warwickshire,North Warwickshire,Hartshill,SP3194,From finder,52.54297762,-1.54432979,WMID-9C4EAC,,WMID9C4EAC.jpg,Late Bronze Age: Incomplete socketed axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMID9C4EAC.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/590273.jpg

The axe has a shield shaped pattern below a very slight stop ridge, and raised flange facets. The blade of the object expands outwards to a crescentic cutting edge. The cutting edge measures 1mm thick. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The blade (measured from the cutting edge to the start of the flanges) is 37mm in length.



At the top of the blade below the flanges on each face of the object is an incised U-shaped groove which is probably an area of decoration typically described as shield shaped. The rear part of the axe (from the slight stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The flanges are worn and turn slightly inwards towards the septum where the handle would have been hafted.



The object has a dark black-brown patina and is heavily pitted in places with the pitting maintaining the same patina.



Many short flanged axes of this type are very narrow and they are probably a specialist tool / chisel. They evolve into palstaves when the stop ridges fuse with the side flanges

The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile) with the widest part at the stop ridge. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is 64.1 mm long, 24.2 mm wide, and 12.9 mm thick. The butt of the axe has been slightly damaged leaving two rounded corners with a gap between. The butt is 27.1 mm wide and 58.7 mm thick.



The flange facets are fused to the stop ridge forming two sub-rectangular raised elements to haft the axe by.



In total the palstave measures 134.8 mm in length, 55.3 mm wide (maximum) and 22.7 mm thick. It weighs 168.3 g.



The palstave is a mid to dark green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.

817257,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-900,"Copper alloy Middle Bronze Age side looped and socketed spearhead, recently broken into two pieces. The blade is leaf-shaped with a lozengiform sectioned midrib. It exhibits a hollow socket and cast side loops. The spearhead measures 126mm total length, 20.8mm maximum width, 1.6mm minimum width. The mouth has a diameter of 17.1mm. It weighs 42.3g.



The tip of the blade exhibits some chipping and the edges of the blade are incomplete due to old breakages. The blade measures 73.8mm in length. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering lozenge shaped midrib which expands into the socket of the spear. The socket mouth is circular in shape and exhibits old breakages around the circumference. The socket is filled with soil. Just below the bottom of the blade, the spear has suffered a recent break across the socket, probably as a result of agricultural activity. The mouth of the socket is filled with soil. At the break point there are traces of wood visible.



The loops are positioned on either side of the socket, just below the break, approximately opposite one another. The loops measure c.16.5mm in length, 6.1mm in width and project 2.5mm from the socket. Casting ribs are visible running along both sides of the body from the mouth to the point at which the blade commences and appear to have been filed.



The spearhead has a mottled dark brown patina with patches of green.



Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).

The axe is complete, except for the broken side loop, and in good condition. The body of the palstave is narrow but splays down the blade eventually flaring at the blade edge which is wide. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which may well have been hammered. The butt is squared, tapering with narrow flanges on both sides. The broken side loop is adjacent to the stop ridge. The length is 183mm, the width of blade is 90mm, width of butt is 22mm thickness 40mm and the weight too heavy for scales. There is a median thin rib from the stop ridge to the blade facet that flares into a fan shape. Similar to NLM-EE77E7, LEIC-6799A2. Similar to Read (1995: p.3 fig 3) dated 1450 - 1250BC.



Type Silsden side-looped palstaves are commonly found in the northern Britain and are especially widespread in Yorkshire. The closest comparable hoard is the Silsden hoard, Yorkshire which also contained two palstaves. (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 616, no. 923-4). The two Type Silsden side-looped palstaves can be dated to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 161). They are classified within the broader 'Late Palstave' type but are typologically close to 'Transitional Palstaves' such as Type Shelf (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160).

820834,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. 



The side view of the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. The long edges on the sides are slightly bevelled, leaving a subtle rectangular central band at the apex and therefore forming a slightly bulging profile.



In cross section the body of the axe has a slight H-shape as the side edges of the axe have been raised by hand hammering to form slight flanges, and therefore forming a curved sloped to the base of the spetum. The depth between the height of the flanges and base of the centre of the spetum is 0.64mm. The flanges appear to have been cast and probably augmented by hammering. There is no decoration present and the casting flanges have been trimmed filled and hammered flat. 



On both faces of the axe there is a slight bump / rib / proto-stop ridge, measuring 46.43mm from the apex of the butt. There is a median bevel when the blade starts to taper from the body of the axe and it measure 80.46mm from the apex of the butt to the median bevel. The median bevel is visible on both faces and is angular. 



On one face the space between the bump/rib-stop and the median bevel there are slight hammer mark traces forming a subtly mottled surface. The other face has active corrosion and a corrosion product adhered to the surface so any hammer marks are not visible. 



The blade tip flares outwards from the body forming a concave hollow. The blade appears to be symmetrical. There is no obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge, although it does tapers giving a slightly blunt edge. 



The surface of the axe, with the exception of the corroded areas, has a well-developed, shiny mottled dark green to dark grey patina. When the surface is reflected in a good light there is a hint of a shiny fine grey glittery surface which is likely to be due to leaching of the alloys in the burial environment where the tin element is better preserved.



The axe measures 100.75mm in length, 58.89mm in width, 10.93mm thick and weighs163.1g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. 



This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-05-15T23:00:00Z,2016-08-15T23:00:00Z,,,163.1,,,10.93,100.75,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Stratford-on-Avon,Sambourne,SP0761,From finder,52.2471376,-1.89889148,WAW-2779F8,,WAW2779F8.jpg,"Bronze Age axe (profile, plan, profile and plan).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW2779F8.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/595682.jpg

The mouth of the chape is lozenge in form; the long side of the aperture has a deep U-shaped notch in the centre and extended sides that that from two tapering upward projecting arms that would have ran parallel with the scabbard, one arm is truncated. A pronounced central rib runs down the length of both faces and ends at the base where there is an oval disc with chamfered sides. In the centre of the rib is a hole that passes from one side to the next and may have been a rivet hole to secure the chape onto the scabbard.



There are small holes over the whole surface which is a defect in the casting process.

821382,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1100,"A late Middle to early Late Bronze Age (1500 - 1100 BC) copper alloy dirk. The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade. Two rivet holes to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, both of which still retains its rivet; the rivet is 16mm long with a 9mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The sides of the blade are straight and gradually taper to the point, running down the length of the blade on both sides is a very low central spine. Post depositional corrosion has resulted in shallow notches being removed from the side of the blade and much of the edge of the butt, plus small patches of active bronze disease are present, but otherwise this item is in very good condition with a light green patina over most of the artefact.

822060,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-700,"Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been circular in plan and plano-convex in profile, but this ingot is square in plan, triangular in profile, and rectangular in section, as it comes from one edge of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There is a large rectangular rim and recess on one face which could potentially represent a socket that has been melted into the ingot, perhaps from a socketed knife. There are also two rivets that have not melted into the ingot and have cavities around them, and two cavities in the form of blades on the other side of the ingot, perhaps from the ends of chisels. The XRF data below in the notes field indicates this ingot is largely copper, which would add some doubt to the possibility of this ingot having been melted from other objects (Matt Knight pers comm). But perhaps these objects have separated away from the ingot and retained their shape because the copper alloy weapons and tools would melt at a higher temperature than the pure copper ingot and must have been added to the metal for the original ingot (Martin Page pers comm).There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

822061,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"Two fragments of a cast copper alloy sword, part of the hilt and part of the blade, which are not connected. The hilt is lozenge-shaped in plan and in section, broken between the hilt tang and its shoulders at one edge and between the shoulders and the beginning of the blade at the other edge. There is a raised and rounded mid-rib that rises about 3 mm above the surface of the hilt on both broken edges and averages about 12 mm in width, and a rivet hole that is half way along the angled outer edge and 3.5 mm in diameter. The blade is rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in section, with a raised but flattened mid-rib that rises about 2 mm above the surface of the blade on both sides and averages about 12 mm in width, between two raised longitudinal lines that are 5 mm in from the existing edges, where the blade starts to taper to its cutting edge on either side, now missing. Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is likely between the hilt and the middle of the sword as this is where the blade tapers before expanding at the mid point. 



Corrosion across the breaks indicates this was done in antiquity and the breaks show signs of high porosity in the metal at a macroscopic level, which would have influenced the breakage. Additionally, there are indentations below the break on the midrib on both edges of the hilt fragment which appear to be consistent with the bronze patina and it is possible these represent chisel marks (Matt Knight pers comm). 



These fragments may be a result of the deliberate decomissioning of the sword into separate pieces before it was ritually destroyed, or it may have been broken up in order to melt it down and re-use the metal. The two broken edges of the blade look like they were subsequently trimmed in order to re-use the weapon as a tool such as a razor or scraper. One broken end of the blade has a central semi-circular notch that is 5 mm in diameter which may have been used to break the sword at this point or deliberately produced as part of a rivet hole for later hafting when the fragment was re-used.There are also indentations and hammer marks on the two fragments that suggests the intentional breaking up of the sword, and a 'V' shape cut into the edge of the blade that indicates collision with another sword edge, perhaps during sparring (Neil Burridge pers comm).



There are pitted areas of corrosion on the surface but there appears to be the original golden-coloured bronze surface still visible underneath, as though the sword may have been in waterlogged conditions before ending up in the field in which it was found.The lozenge-shaped section of the blade with a raised central mid-rib suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.

The socketed axehead fragment measures 26.1 mm in length, 47.2 mm wide (at the blade), 39.6 mm wide (at the body), 13.1 mm thick (at the body), 1.7 mm thick (at the blade edge). The remnants of the socket is 3.8 mm deep. It weighs 47.5 g.



The socketed axehead is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.



Peter Reavill (Herefordshire & Shropshire FLO) commented on a similar socketed axehead fragment (WMID-EB5248) that it is late BA rather than Middle - as in post Wilburton - Llyn Fawr phase (1150-750 BC). Almost all socketed axes are from the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC). This example is likely to be similar in dating.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,47.5,,,13.1,26.1,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Eccleshall,SJ7732,From finder,52.88496161,-2.34324599,WMID-DF1D02,,WMIDDF1D02.jpg,Late Bronze Age: Incomplete socketed axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/WMIDDF1D02.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/600682.jpg
825327,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1200,"An incomplete copper alloy socketed spearhead, of Middle Bronze Age dating (1400 BC to 1200 BC).



Around 50% of the spearhead is present, in two joining fragments. Most of the spearhead and some of the blades are present, the rest is missing, presumed lost in antiquity.



The spearhead is broadly lentoid (diamond) in shape. The socket is incomplete.. The remains of the socket is circular, and extends through both fragments. The blades were probably originally triangular in shape, they taper inwards to the socket.



The larger fragment measures 71.4 mm in length, a maximum width of 33.5 mm, across the blades in the centre. It is 14.3 mm thick. The metal is 1.6 mm thick. The socket is 16.1 mm wide at the base, and 8.9 mm wide at the tip. The blades have a surviving width of 9.7 mm and are 2.9 mm thick. It weighs 34.6 g.



The smaller fragment measures 24.6 mm in length, 21.8 mm wide and 10.7 mm thick. The metal is 2.0 mm thick. The socket is 7.5 mm wide at the base, and 4.6 mm wide at the top. It weighs 7.6 g.



Together both fragments weigh 42.4 g.



The spearhead is a mid green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



From the shape of the blades, it is possible that this spearhead fragment was a side looped and socketed type, such as HESH-CFC925 and HESH-C348E5. Peter Reavill comments on those records that: Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC. It is reasonable to assume that this spearhead is of a similar date.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,42.4,,,14.3,84,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Stafford,Eccleshall,SJ7633,From finder,52.89390686,-2.35818076,WMID-E2A194,,WMIDE2A194_D.jpg,Middle Bronze Age: Incomplete spear head,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/charm15/WMIDE2A194_D.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/599438.jpg

The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded sub-oval or leaf-shaped blades. The hollow socket is near complete and is slightly chamfered at the base.. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge. The tip of the spearhead is complete however the side blades have been broken. The overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) pointed midrib. This midrib expands to the socket of the spear. The central raised line of the mid-rib does not extend into the socket. The socket is roughly half the whole length of the spear. The cross section of the spear is lentoid and the socket is circular. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams have been filed or polished away. 



The spearhead measures 104.02mm length, has a maximum width (across base of socket) of 14 mm. The depth of the socket is 55 mm. The spearhead weighs 42.89 grams. The mouth of the socket has a diameter of 12.5mm and a thickness of 2 mm.

Condition: broken at either end with no signs of preformation or terminal (some examples previously discovered do feature these elements). The ends are broken and ragged and there are a number of tears and folds along the body of the strip.

Dimensions: 

Length: 32mm

Width: 9mm

Weight: 1.52g

Gold content: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip by the British Museum Scientific Research team indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-88% gold, 11-12% silver, the rest being copper (1-2%). See appended report. 

Discussion: Similar grooved, pierced gold ribbons are well known, examples include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5); 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97.

The incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and &#39;ribbons&#39; of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672).

The pin has broken across its projecting loop and the lower part of the shaft is missing. There is a casting void visible in the break. The pin has a swelling shaft which is extensively decorated; five groups of bands encircle the shaft in the order 5,4,5,6, 6 with the band of five being closest to the head of the pin and the band of six at the break in the shaft. In three instances the space between two individual grooves is infilled with transverse nicks (or short straight lines). The wider space left between the band of five and the band of six is infilled with a closely-spaced diamond lattice of grooves. The shaft of the pin widens and splays as it meets the flat circular (24.75mm diameter) back of the head of the pin which is extensively covered with abrasions caused by grinding.



On the outer face of the circular head is a cylindrical projection with a dished interior; this is presumably intended for a missing setting, perhaps of amber. Around this cylinder is a circle of fourteen truncated cones which project a little beyond the central cylinder.

830116,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1000,"A complete copper alloy Bronze Age pegged and looped spear head dating to the Middle Bronze Age,1500-1150 BC. The spear is 210 mm in length and 39.90 mm at its widest point. The spear consists of a leaf-shaped blade, which tapers towards the tip. The blade is lozenge-form in cross section; the blade edges are rough in places, showing some wear and tear. The blade has a circular cross-sectioned mid-rib which gradually widens towards the base of the blade to form the socket. The mid-rib has a pronounced moulded groove bordering each side of the blade. At the top of each of these grooves, there is an elongated loop either side of the shaft, c 9.24 mm in length and 3 mm wide.



The top of the shaft displays some wear resulting in jagged edges for about half the circumference. A peghole pierces the shaft on each side, 18.42 mm down from the top of the shaft, in line with the leaves on the blade. These holes are c 4.82 mm in diameter. The socket is 20.79 mm in internal diameter.



One surface of the shaft is pierced in several places along much of the length of the blade, just above the groove: there are two small holes; another larger at 8.40 mm long; and a substantial rent 40.55 mm long and 6.26 mm high. In general, the surface of the shaft is smooth and uniform, with patches of green patina in places, above and below, mainly confined to the grooves.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,142,,,,210,1,Helen Baker,Helen Baker,South East,Oxfordshire,West Oxfordshire,Grafton and Radcot,SP2701,,51.70709279,-1.6106593,WILT-DAEC0E,,WILTDAEC0E.jpg,Bronze Age spear,Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rhenry2/WILTDAEC0E.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/601235.jpg

830606,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (Bronze) flat axe of the Early Bronze Age period dating from  c. 2250 BC - 1900 BC.



The flat axe is broadly trapezoidal in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid (pointed oval), with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid. The axe is broken toward the butt of the axe, but more than three-quarters of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge. It seems most probable that the axe was cast in an open mould. All the diagnostic elements of the axe are lost (such as shape of butt and hafting specifications). The condition of the axe is poor - the majority of the surface patina has been removed by laminating corrosion, which appears to be active. 



The axe measures 77.6 mm in length, it is 34.4 mm wide at the butt and the blade is 75.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 8.7 mm, the blade is 2.8 mm thick. It weighs 253.6 g.



The object is a dark brown in colour with an uneven patina. Areas of green active corrosion are present on the surface of the object. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of much of the original surface detail. From the blade shape (which could be described as fan-like) it is probable that the axe falls into the Migdale tradition of metalworking. This fits with the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC. Axes such as this are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

830724,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"A copper-alloy dagger, possibly dating to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300 to 1150 BC). The dagger possesses a lentoidal-section tang which is rectangular in form and expands and flattens to form a rounded terminal. Extending from both the upper and lower surfaces of the tang are small, semi-circular projections measuring 14mm in length and 1mm in width. These projections would have helped secure a handle to the dagger. The tang expands to form the blade which is lentoidal in section and gently tapers to a point, now broken. It measures 180mm in length, the blade has a maximum width of 25mm and a thickness of 3mm. The tang has a width of 14mm.



The object was originally in two pieces and has been restored. It is difficult to fit this small dagger into existing typologies for Bronze Age weaponry and thus its identification must remain tentative. Dot Boughton comments 'that it might belong to the Penard phase, dating to the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age 1300-1150 BC and be a Ballintober type. Most British Ballintober swords come from the Thames Valley and a small number was found in South West England and South Wales.

831076,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a copper alloy, side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of probably the Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1500 - c. BC 1150.



The fragment would have made the tip of the spear. The object is broadly triangular in plan and lozenge (diamond shaped) in section. There is a raised rib running the length of the fragment on both the front and the reverse face. From the rib each side of the fragment slopes down towards the blade. The cutting edges of the blade are damaged and much of the edge is now missing, presumed lost in antiquity. The tip of the fragment is also damaged, probably as a result of post depositional damage whilst within the plough soil. 



The object measures 20.0 mm in length and is 18.8 mm wide at the base of the fragment and the tip is 4.8 mm wide. The tip has a thickness of 4.5 mm, the blade edge is 2.8 mm thick, and the base measures 15.6 mm thick. It weighs 5.8 g. 



The object is a dark green in colour and has an even patina. There is evidence of post depositional damage on the surface of the object in the form of pitting and indentations. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.

831393,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-1000,"The hoard consists of seven objects (two tools and five ornaments). Among the ornaments there are three annular decorated armrings/bracelets, one spiral coiled finger-ring and one short section from a spiral twisted torc, all made of copper alloy. Among the tools there is a palstave axehead and a socketed hammer, both also in copper alloy. No other details of the composition/arrangement of the hoard (or of any other objects) were recorded.



Catalogue: 



1. Bracelet/armring, annular, decorated (complete) ('Liss' type). 



A complete copper alloy bracelet/armring decorated probably by engraving/incision, with several panels of decoration separated by less complex 'dividing' patterns. Condition is generally very good and the bronze is golden in patches and green/corroded in other areas. The decoration is relatively deep and has been applied with some degree of care. There are guidelines visible at various locations on the body of the bracelet/armring, which presumably relate to the application of the decoration. \



The complex decoration is best appreciated by photographs and line-drawings but the arrangement is as follows:



Panel A: Elliptic nested motifs built up from combinations of three lines separated by a row of dots alongside semi-circular patterns with the same design logic. These are arranged approximately one atop the other [i.e. ')('].



A 'dividing' section of 10 lines (running vertically to the circumference of the bracelet-armring - please note, this is true of all other decorative elements described as 'lines' in the below description), a row of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern, five lines, a section of criss-cross decoration, seven lines.



Panel B: Is made up of a geometric pattern consisting of (filled and unfilled) chevrons on either side of a central bar that is made of line, dot and ladder motifs.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines.



Panel C: Is made up of nested chevrons, above and below which are panels that could only be appreciated from above rather than from the side view of the bracelet/armring. They consist of a line of dots with horizontal lines to both sides and a row of herringbone.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines, a section of criss-cross decoration, three lines, a lot of dots followed by three further lines.



A repetition of Panel B.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines.



Dimensions: External diameter: 88mm; Internal diameter: 59mm; Thickness of bar: (width) 15mm; (height) 18mm; Weight: 362g.



2. Bracelet/armring, annular, decorated (incomplete) ('Liss' type).



An incomplete copper alloy bracelet/armring (missing around a third of the original length). It is decorated probably by engraving/incision, with several panels of decoration separated by less complex 'dividing' patterns. The decoration is relatively deep and has been applied with some degree of care. Condition is generally very good and the bronze is golden in places but green/corroded in other areas.



The overall decorative scheme is very similar to bracelet/armring No. 1 and the same 'dividing' and 'panel' system used above can be applied:



Break in bracelet/armring that comes into a 'dividing' section of criss-cross decoration followed by three lines (running vertically to the circumference of the bracelet-armring - please note, this is true of all other decorative elements described as 'lines' in the below description), a line of dots followed by three further lines.



Panel B.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines



Panel A.



A 'dividing' section of five lines, a row of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern, four lines, a section of criss-cross decoration, five lines, a row of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern, five lines.



A repetition of Panel B which breaks off due to the missing section.



Dimensions: External diameter: 88mm; Internal diameter: 59mm; Thickness of bar: (width) 13-14mm; (height) 18mm; Weight: 257g.



3. Bracelet/armring, annular, decorated (complete) ('Liss' type). 



A complete copper alloy bracelet/armring decorated probably by engraving/incision. The decoration is simpler than bracelet/armrings Nos. 1-2 and it weighs less than the complete example (No. 1). It comprises of four panels carrying the same motif: tightly nested/stacked herringbone that face a mirror image of the same motif, creating this effect: '>><<'. The panels are separated by diving sections made up of lines that run vertically to the circumference of the bracelet/armring. There are four of these dividing sections. The number of the lines in each is not always identical (there are 12, 15, 16, and 16 respectively).



Dimensions: External diameter: 88mm; Internal diameter: 61mm; Thickness of bar: (width) 13mm; (height) 15mm; Weight: 295g.



4. Spiral finger ring. Made from a single bar of copper alloy that has been spiralled into two complete loops and two half loops at the top and bottom, where the terminals are forged down neatly, presumably to prevent them from catching/snagging. Small hammer marks are visible on the external surfaces. The condition is generally very good with patches of golden bronze mixed with green patches of corrosion.



Dimensions: Height (of spiralled stack): 22m; Diameter: 29-31mm; Thickness of bar used to make ring: 6mm; Height of bar used to make ring: 8mm; Weight: 56g



5. Spiral twisted torc fragment. A fragment of a copper alloy spiral twisted torc with old breaks at either end that appear to have been made in antiquity. The fragment still has soil adhering to the surfaces but it is possible to see that the metal has been twisted from a bar rather than cast to appear twisted.



Dimensions: Length (measured with a soft tape): 60mm; Thickness: 5.5mm; Weight: 9g.



6. Socketed hammer. A copper alloy socketed hammer. Condition is generally good, with patches of golden bronze and other areas of green corrosion. There is evidence of wear to the hammer's surface and sides. There is a small casting flaw near the collar: a small perforation that would not have interfered with the function.



Dimensions: Length: 70mm; Hammer's striking surface dimensions: (height) 26mm; (width) 15mm; Socket dimensions: (height) 25mm; (width) 22mm; collar thickness: 4mm; Weight: 148g.



7. Palstave axehead. An unlooped copper alloy palstave with central mid-rib and unpronounced stop-ridge. The palstave is best placed in Rowland's Class 3 (1976, 32-3). There are features in common with his Class 4 (the lack of pronounced stop-ridge) but this is not sufficiently strong to place it in that class, although some degree of hybridisation may have taken place.



Dimensions: Length: 143mm; Blade width: 60mm; Butt width: 20mm; Width of flanges: 30mm; Weight: 332g.



Discussion:



The finds catalogued above form part of a Taunton Assemblage hoard (c.1400-1250 BC). Several ornament hoards of Taunton phase have been found in Hampshire to date (see Roberts 2007; Wilkin 2016, 42-3, App. 2.1 and Treasure Case 2016 T940) and, more broadly, across Southern England (Ibid., in passim). The condition of the objects, and the presence of three decorated annular bracelet/armrings, two of which are decorated to a very high standard with complex motifs, makes this an important addition to the corpus of ornament hoards. The decoration of the three decorated bracelets/armrings deserves further study/commentary but for now it may be noted that the motifs are consistent with those from other known examples, several of which are from Hampshire (cf. Rowlands 1971).","As a single find of more than two objects of prehistoric date, the objects catalogued above (Nos. 1-7) constitute a find of Treasure as stipulated by the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

831583,Strap Fitting,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1150,150,"A complete copper alloy strap distributor or toggle dating from the late bronze age to the Roman period, c. 1150 BC to AD 150. The strap distributor is sub rectangular in shape with a rectangular openwork centre. There are four spherical knops at the junction of each angle, with a bar in between each. The bar is oval in cross section. Either side and at the base of one of the spheres the metal has been very worn, suggesting that may have been attached or held something. The strap distributor is a dark brown colour, with patches of light brown red corrosion. The spherical junctions have a light green patina. It measures 22.5mm x 22.8mm x 9.0mm, and weighs 12.67g.

832084,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-1500,"Cast copper alloy flat axe dating to the Early-Mid Bronze Age (2350 - 1500 BC). The axe is narrow with straight but tapering sides and there are no signs of a stop ridge. The sides of the axe are very slightly thickened, but it does not have flanges.



The metal is dark green in colour with a heavily pitted and corroded patina.

833749,Jewellery,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-800,"A rolled-up strip of gold of probable Chalcolithic or Bronze Age date (c. 2500-800 BC). The strip of gold is sub-rectangular in plan, and is rolled up (width ways), forming a tight roll which has been slightly squashed into an oval shape (when viewed from the side). Eleven folds can be counted from the middle. There is some soil still attached to and within these folds. The strip is very thin (less than a diameter). The strip is wider in the middle than near the end, where it tapers from c. 21 mm in the middle towards 15 mm at the end (the end hidden in the folds in the centre of the bundle is also narrower than the middle). It becomes even narrower towards the very end, but how narrow cannot be assessed as the tapering end has been folded over backwards twice so that the very end of the strip is hidden between the first fold. The outer surface of the strip that can be seen (the rest being hidden between the folds) is undecorated, and has a pitted, uneven and slightly creased surface. There are also several small probable post-depositional scratches on the outer surface of the roll. A small cut or break is visible on the edge of the strip in the second and eighth fold, but they do not appear to extend across the entire width of the strip.



Measurements: The rolled-up gold strip has a maximum height of 21 mm, a maximum width of 15 mm and a breadth of 12 mm. It weighs 15.09 g (including soil).



Metal content: Analysis of the gold at the British Museum demonstrated that the object was 95-96% gold and has a composition consistent with a Bronze Age date.



Discussion: This object would have been a long, narrow thin strip of gold tapering towards the ends. Unfortunately, due to its rolled-up condition, the ends in the strip described here cannot be seen, so any possible perforations, if present, are not visible. Unlike several other gold strips of Bronze Age date (e.g. WMID-FE3C28, NMGW-39F32D no. 1, KENT-D13625, BERK-BA8440, HAMP-36C41B, PAS-067AC5), this strip does not seem to have been decorated. Such plain gold strips without any archaeological context present problems for dating. They are relatively undiagnostic examples of Bronze Age goldwork in Southern England (c.2500-800 BC) and parallels are hard to find (cf. Murgia et al. 2014). However, there are a few similar objects. In France there is an example of a plain tapered strip of gold from the Saint-Babel hoard. It was rolled up in a very similar way as the strip discussed here (Eluère 1982, 114, pl. 137). However this strip or bracelet is a lot thicker and shorter than the strip discussed here. Another plain strip of gold with a tapered end and two small perforations was found in an Early Bronze Age Breton hoard, but unfortunately this piece is incomplete so its length cannot be assessed (Eluère 1982, 57 pl. 68). Another object in continental Europe which is similar to the strip described here is illustrated and described as a diadem by Perea (1991, 50); it comes from a Chalcolithic collective tomb at Cueva de los Murciélagos, Granada, in the south of Spain. However, the object is a lot wider in the middle than the strip described here. In Ireland a plain gold strip with rounded, tapered ends was found in Co Cavan (Taylor 1980, pl. 28 g,h & i), but this strip was decorated and only 285 mm long.



In the UK there also are a few parallels for this object. CORN-8EC344 for instance, is a plain gold strip with tapered, rounded ends that have been folded over. There are punch holes inside these folded terminals which may have held a nail. Another plain gold band (or 'ribbon') folded over on itself to create four layers was found in West Mersea Essex (ESS-9D1D4A) and this only had one perforated terminal. A similar possible Bronze Age plain gold band or 'ribbon' was found in Dorset (DOR-52C762). This band is broken at one end and the other tapers to an unperforated terminal. A plain gold strip from the Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-09A1A5), with perforated and folded terminals, is dated from the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1300 BC) (Portable Antiquities and Treasure Annual Report 2008 273, no.24, 42). A hoard from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo, Carmarthenshire had two items that may be comparable; a gold securing strip with perforated folded terminals from a gold armlet or cuff, and incomplete crushed gold armlet formed of a plain strip with tapered terminals (Savory 1980, 125, 195, fig.47, nos. 1 and 4). This hoard is dated to the Middle Bronze Age c.1600-1400 BC (bid. 125).



However, the closest parallels for this rolled-up gold strip are two possible diadems or neck-chokers. The first of these was found near Winchester in Hampshire (HAMP-AEA895). This is a long, cigar shaped strip of sheet gold with tapered ends. Both ends have three small perforations set in a triangle. The transverse creases in this strip (which was unrolled) are consistent with it having been rolled up and crushed flat, in a very similar way as the object described here. This deliberate destructive treatment (folding, rolling, damaging) is fairly common in Bronze Age objects that are deposited as part of a hoard. The second 'diadem' comes from Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire (WAW-FF1E9A). It is broken into two pieces, but they appear to have formed a long slender sheet of gold with tapering ends. Both ends have three small perforations. Unlike the first example, the edge of this sheet is decorated with a border of fine pointille decoration and although the sheet was crumpled, it was not folded.



Based in the available parallels, the rolled-up gold strip can be assigned to the Bronze Age and deserves further research.","In terms of age and precious metal content, the object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",4,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,2016T187,,15.09,21,,,,1,Neil Wilkin,Ian Richardson,Eastern,Essex,Chelmsford,Little Baddow,TL7808,From finder,51.74242844,0.576797,PAS-6DBE56,,2016T187a.JPG,Bronze Age gold strip,The British Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2016T187a.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/604283.jpg
833840,Mould,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A copper alloy Middle Bronze Age palstave mould formed of two interlocking halves (i.e. bivalve) was found on the 25th of February 2017. No other objects or details of the find context were reported. The two halves (valves) of the palstave mould are described separately below and have been labelled and referred to as 'Part A' and 'Part B' throughout.



Description: 



Soil still adheres to both parts of the bivalve mould (especially to 'Part B') but X-radiography has assisted in description of both parts.



Valve (Part A) 



A valve for a Middle Bronze Age palstave with semi-circular pouring/sprue cup (see Fig. 1). The internal surfaces are well finished (although soil still adheres). Three small rounded tendons (semi-circular in cross section) are raised c.2-3mm above the surface of the mould and are designed to interlock with the negative impressions (sockets) found on Part B (see below). There are two tendons on either side of the stop ridge and the third is located at the blade edge of the valve, approximately midway along the length of the blade. There is a relatively deep mid-rib in the centre of the blade (c.4-5mm) and some scoring to the septum surfaces (see Fig. 1).



On the exterior surface of the mould there are two small circular protrusions (or 'pellets') located at the blade end of the valve, approximately level with the corners of the palstave's cutting blade (see Fig. 2). There is an area of white speckled patina extending around the centre of the mould and in one or two isolated patches on the corner of the valve and at the pouring sprue end.



Within the soil from the valve were three small heavily corroded pellets of ?copper alloy (now bagged and stored separately), more work is required to analyse and understand these inclusions. Other, similar fragments can be seen in the soil that still adheres to the interior surface of the valve.



Damage: A crack runs through the valve and is most noticeable on the exterior surface of the valve. It is 60mm in length and widens towards the blade end of the mould (where it reaches a maximum width of c.1mm). This crack is likely to be ancient. Other fissures can be seen in the septum (running perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the palstave impression) and can be seen on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the valve (compare Figs. 1 & 2). These cracks/fissures (and others) are identified in the X-Radiography images provided by Daniel O'Flynn (Scientist, The British Museum) (see Fig. 3 & 4). Radiography reveals that the crack on the blade edge extends to the mid-rib of the palstave mould impression.



Dimensions: Total length of valve: 212mm; Width of valve: 90mm (at the max. point of blade width); Width of valve (min.): 47mm; Width (at pouring cup terminal): 50.5mm; Height of pouring cup: 25mm; Length (pouring cup to stop-ridge): 77mm; Length (stop ridge to edge of blade): 104mm; Width (max. blade width): 70mm; Width (at stop ridge): 25mm; Weight: 1461g.



Valve (Part B) 



Description: A valve for a Middle Bronze Age palstave with semi-circular pouring sprue/cup. The pouring sprue/cup end of valve is eroded/worn, possibly through use prior to deposition. The interior surface of the valve has three corresponding sockets for the tendons of valve 'Part A' (see Fig. 1). There is a semi-circular indent in interior surface of the valve that has a depth of c.7mm. This may have function to enable the metalworker to separate the two valves easily following the casting process. Soil adheres to the surfaces of this valve more fully than Part A. But the X-Radiographic image demonstrates that the patterning is identical to Part A, as one would expect (Fig. 3-4). There are cracks running horizontally across the blade on either side of the valve. Radiography confirms that these do not meet. They are visible on the exterior and the interior surfaces of the mould.



The impression of the palstave has not been set as evenly within the valve, hence the distance between blade corners to edge of the mould is 10mm and 12mm in the case of 'Part A' but 6.5mm and 13mm in the case of 'Part B' (Fig. 1).



On the exterior surface the same white-speckled patina that features on the exterior of valve 'Part A' covers the middle section of the valve (Fig. 2). There is no equivalent to the pellets that are found on the corners of the exterior surface of 'Part A'.



Damage: Cracks can be seen through the blade, running through the mould but not extending across its full width. These cracks are likely to be ancient. X-Radiography (Fig. 4) reveals additional cracking within the septum of the palstave impression, running perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the palstave impression and extending from the mid-rib to the edge of the blade.



Dimensions: Are as 'Part A' with a slightly heavier weight (1482g), probably due to the adherence of soil. The palstave impression sits less evenly within the surface area of the mould (as noted above).



Discussion:



This is only the tenth Middle Bronze Age palstave mould found in Britain to date and only the fourth example of a mould used to produce unlooped palstaves (Adams & Webley 2016, Table 1; A. Gwilt pers comm.). It is the first to have been found in Oxfordshire, if we exclude the palstave-chisel from Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire (Adams & Webley 2016, no. 47). Other palstave moulds have been found in Southern England, including examples from London, Norfolk, Shropshire and Wiltshire.



The mould would have been used to cast broad bladed palstaves of Rowland's (1976, 32-3) Class 3, Group 1. The mould is most similar to that from Deansfield/Danesfield, Gwynedd, Bangor, Wales (Adams & Webley 2016, no. 20; British Museum Reg. 1849, 0521.5). That mould also has two tendons on either side of one valve and would have been used to produce similarly formed palstaves of Class 3, Group 1 (Rowlands 1976, 32-3).



Two factors may account for the abandonment and/or deposition of the bivalve mould. Firstly, the two valves fit relatively snuggly at the blade end of the bivalve (as one would expect for the bivalve to function effectively) but there is a bowing of both valves at the pouring sprue/cups ends (Fig. 5). This would lead to spillage and miscasting and would be very difficult to correct or stimmy. Similar bowing of copper alloy moulds has been noted on modern (experimental) examples and has resulted in the failure of the mould to cast successfully (N. Burridge pers comm.). Secondly, the large cracks across both fragments (see Figs. 3-4) would create potential for leakage and failure to cast palstaves of adequate form for use.



Please note: further conservation work and scientific research would be highly desirable given the relative rarity of this find.

Discussion: A number of similar objects have been reported as potential Treasure, individually and as components in hoards, and are recorded on the PAS database. They are most typically described as Bronze Age ingots, such as 2004 T416 (nos. 41, 48 & 49) & CORN-199400 (2005 T110).  Some are suggested to have been fragments of Bronze Age bracelets, including SUSS-23E3A5 (2004 T59) & IOW-BD19F8 (2007 T429). 



A small number of similar objects have also been recorded as unidentified in terms of both object type and date, including SF-2D6E28 (2008 T310) & KENT-C4CEE1 (2010 T439).

837132,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-900,-700,"Late Bronze to early Iron Age (c. 900 to 700 BC) socketed axe: The axe has been cast from copper alloy and is complete. The mouth of the socket is almost a square, with rounded corners and convex sides. On two interior edges, opposite each other, there is a slight semi-circular moulded platform. The socket is 92.31mm deep and tapers in depth more than it tapers in width. The rim of the mouth is abraded and undulating because of the abrasion. The socketed mouth moulding on the exterior just has a single sub-triangular sectioned collar.



The sides of the axe have a slender casting seam, with the seam, on one face, curving over the integral loop. The loop s D-shaped with a sub-oval perforation which has traces of the casting seam within it. The faces of the axe are slightly narrower than the sides, causing the sides to be slightly faceted and rounded. The sides taper towards the blade edge



The axe faces appear to be flat and undecorated. There is surface abrasion and the faces have lost some of their patina. The edges of the faces have parallel sides and a splayed cutting edge. The blade tips are rounded and the cutting edge is abraded, very worn and is slightly convex. The cutting edge may have been sharpened extensively as the blade edge is quite thick and does not have the bevel you occasionally see. There is not decoration on the axe.



The axe measures 111.27mm long, 66.05mm wide across the blade tips, 40.08mm thick across the mouth moulding and weighs 324g. The socket mouth interior measurements are 27.82mm long and 27.49mm wide.

Similarly, a casting rib is visible running from the tip of the blade down the body to the socket on both faces. One has been filed, the other is untouched. On either side of the socket are the stubs of loops. These appear to have been filed down. Between the stubs on one side is an irregualrly shaped hole which appears to be casting flaw. On the opposite side a hole has been drilled.



Total length: 125.5mm, maximum width: 28.1mm, minimum width: 11.4mm, maximum thickness: 9.9mm, minimum thickness: 1.5mm, weight: 61.1g.



The spearhead has a mottled dark brown patina with patches of green.



Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).

840194,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-800,"An addendum to the previously recorded 'Tendring Hoard' (see PAS ref



A group of 11 bronze objects found through metal detecting in Tendring, Essex, found in the same area and therefore associated with the Tendring Hoard (2015 T590).



1) sword fragment. A fragment of a copper alloy sword blade. The fragment is from the blade, broken across the blade on both ends, resulting in a slight curved or s-shaped profile in section. The cross section shows a convex middle section which then thins towards each blade edge. The curved cross-section suggests that the fragment stems from the upper section of the blade, towards the hilt. Both blade edges are damaged along the length, meaning the original cutting edge is destroyed probably prior to deposition. There appears to be some modern damage to the surface, with deeper scratches and striations revealing a brighter patina.



Dimensions - length: 6.5cm, width: 3.15cm, thickness (max): 0.7cm, weight: 64.31g



2) copper alloy fragment.  An irregular fragment of copper alloy, which appears to have a flat surface as one face, whilst the others are irregular and uneven suggesting this is a piece of casting waste or part of a rough round-shaped ingot.



Dimensions - length (max): 4.6cm, width (max): 2.5cm, thickness (max): 1.7cm, weight: 49g.



3) copper alloy fragment.  A small fragment of copper alloy of irregular shape. There is one flat surface, with an opposite face which appears slightly rounded. The fragment has irregular breaks around all sides revealing an irregular surface. Along with fragment No.2, this could also be part of an ingot.



Dimensions - length (max): 2.2cm, width (max): 1.9cm, thickness: 1.4cm, weight: 19.61g.



4) fragment of a socketed and looped axehead.  Body fragment of a socketed and looped copper alloy axehead, consisting of one face from the socket to approximately half way down the body towards the blade. The fragment has irregular breaks along both sides, and the loop survives along with visible casting seams on both side faces. The break across the blade face is straight and linear, perpendicular to the direction of the axe. The socket has a prominent moulded rim, followed by a parallel moulded ridge c.1cm from the rim leading to an undecorated body. The loop survives intact and begins from the second moulded ridge. From the surviving fragment of the socket, it is possible to suggest that the socket would have been rounded or sub-square. The fragment is quite corroded but there are patches of the original patinaed surface, some of which show scratches.



Dimensions - Length (incomplete): 6cm, width (at socket): 3.6cm, loop length: 2cm, loop width: 0.85cm, weight: 117.11g.



5) fragment of a socketed axehead. A fragment of a copper alloy socketed axe. The fragment includes the narrow asymmetrical blade and most of the axe body, with an irregular break across the body. The visible socket is sub-rectangular in cross-section. The fragment is in good condition but the surface has suffered from corrosion. And the lack of diagnostic features remaining makes it difficult to identify a type.



Dimensions - axe length 6.7cm (incomplete), blade width: 3.9cm, width at break: 2cm, weight: 115.88g.



6) fragment of a socketed axehead.  A large body and blade fragment of a copper alloy socketed axehead, with an irregular break across the body of the axe. Casting seams are visible along each edge, and a number of scratches are visible on the surface in a variety of directions which are likely to a mixture of ancient and more recent damage. There is a clear scuffing of one edge which was probably caused during the recovery of the objects. The cross section of the interior is sub-rectangular, and the body runs straight before flaring into the rounded blade edge.



Dimensions - length (max): 6.9cm, blade width: 4.4cm, width (at break): 3cm, weight: 136.32g.



7) fragment of a socketed and looped axehead. A fragment of a copper alloy socketed and looped axehead, surviving from the base of the loop to half way down the body of the axe, both the socket rim portion and blade edge section are missing. The socket is sub-square in cross-section at the top break at the base of the loop, and widens to sub-rectangular at the second break across the blade body. The fragment comes from a narrow bodied axehead.



Dimensions - length: 4cm, width: 2.4cm (at loop), side width: 2.4cm (at loop), weight: 85.2g.



8) fragment of a socketed axehead.  A small fragment of a copper alloy socketed axehead, consisting of one face from the upper part of the blade. The surface appears to taper out slightly suggesting this fragment is from the middle section of the blade body. In section, the fragment is slightly curved suggesting it has been bent. On one side the casting seem is visible, and linear striations suggest to polishing or working of the axe once cast. All edges of the fragments are created by breaks, one appears to be straight whereas the break at the narrower of the tapered face, and those along the sides are irregular. There are no identifiable features surviving on this fragment.



Dimensions - length: 2.7cm, width (max): 2.8cm, width (min): 1.2cm, thickness:0.4cm, weight: 16.32g.



9) fragment of an axehead. A blade fragment of a copper alloy axehead. The fragment has a linear break across the body of the axe, running perpendicular to the direction of the axe body. The cutting edge is asymmetrical and damaged, although it is likely that the large chips have been removed post-deposition. There is evidence of recent damage on one face perhaps caused during the recovery of the artefacts. The blade is flared slightly, and the sides appear to be faceted leading up to the main portion of the blade body which is now missing. The break reveals a solid interior, with no signs of a socket visible.



Dimensions - length: 3.5cm, blade width: 4.3cm, side width (at break): 1.2cm, weight: 55.35g.



10) fragment of an axehead.  A blade fragment of a copper alloy axehead. The fragment has a linear break across the body, perpendicular to the direction of the blade. the blade edge is irregular through a mixture of ancient and more recent damage; however, the blade would have been asymmetrical prior to deposition.



Dimensions - blade width: 4.5cm, length: 3.2cm, width: 0.8cm, weight: 53.35g.



11) copper alloy artefact.  A small cylindrical piece of possible copper alloy, although the red/brown colour of the surface suggests some surface erosion. The object is cylindrical, and appears to have linear casting seams or ridges along each side. Both ends are rounded.



Dimensions = length: 3.7cm, width: 1.4cm, thickness: 0.95, weight: 22.63g.



Discussion/ identification



No. 1 is identifiable as a sword fragment from the upper part of the blade body. Due to the convex-concave cross-section it is possible to suggest that the fragment comes from a leaf-shaped sword, however a definite identification is impossible due to the significant percentage of the sword which is missing. Due to its association with socketed ace fragments in this group of objects, it could be argued that the fragment comes from a Ewart Park type sword (see Burgess and Colquhoun 1988:66).



Fragments Nos.2 & 3 are irregular and do not resemble any recognisable artefact. The flat surface that each fragment has could suggest they are part of a copper alloy/bronze ingot.



Due to the double rib moulding at the socket, axe fragment No.4 can be loosely categorised as belonging to the South-Eastern type (Schmidt and Burgess 1981:212, Plate 85). South-Eastern axes are characterised by a 'fairly slender, square to rectangular sectioned body with a squarish mouth' (ibid). Axe fragments Nos. 5-8 lack any clear features by which they can be identified, and so they cannot be categorised beyond belonging to socketed axes.



The blade fragments, Nos. 9-10, are likely to belong to a socketed axe due to the presence of other socketed fragments in this assemblage. Because the break is close to the blade tip, the interior is solid in both these fragments and whilst it is more likely that the break occurred below the limit of the socket, these fragments cannot be definitely identified as socketed axeheads or tools.



No.11 is an irregular cylindrical object which is not identifiable as a clear artefact type, however its shape and the presence of casting seams or ridges show that it was a deliberately cast object. Although not diagnostic, a prehistoric date is at least possible.



This assemblage was found by the same finder and in the same location as the Tendring Hoard (2015 T590) and is arguably part of the same hoard of material. The 2015 T590 assemblage included complete and incomplete socketed axes, as well as sword fragments and ingots, therefore the character of the collection described above is similar to the original assemblage discovered. Although this assemblage does not include some of the identifiable socketed axe types which the main hoard did (notably the Yorkshire Type axeheads), the fragmented axes and the broken probable South-Eastern type (No.4), are comparable to a large group of fragmented axes found in T90. The report for 2015 T590 concludes that the hoard belongs to the Later Bronze Age, and the later part of the Ewart Park Phase (c.950-800 BC), although it was noted that the presence of later artefacts within the original assemblage suggested it dated from the transitional period between the Bronze and Iron Age.

Discussion: The hoard appears to date to the Ewart Park Phase of the Late Bronze Age (950 BC-800 BC), and due to the nature of the material is likely to be a scrap metal deposit. As more than one prehistoric base metal object was found in association with one another, based on material and date they constitute a hoard under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996-2002 Treasure designation order. They therefore will qualify as Treasure.","Due to the association of the objects (Nos. 1-11) as a discrete group and because they belonged as part of a larger hoard (addenda to 2015 T590), they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).",3,Copper alloy,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,2016T923,,,,,,,11,Elisha Mason,Sophie Flynn,Eastern,Essex,Tendring,Tendring,TM1323,,51.86489992,1.09222569,ESS-D132C4,,2016T923a.jpg,Sword fragment,The British Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2016T923a.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1028285.jpg
840547,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1875,-1725,"A complete flat axehead with a crescentic blade, of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 1875 BC to c. 1725 BC).



The axehead has a rectangular shape, with a crescentic blade. In profile, it is of a lentoid (pointed oval), with tapering edges. The butt is almost square. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt, to a proto stop ridge, and then taper down to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; however a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This has been formed from hammering and small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces where the metal has been worked to form them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, just forming a change of angle between the face of the butt and the face of the blade.



From the blade to the proto stop ridge, decoration, in the series of parallel linear lentoid lozenges. This form of decoration is known as rain-pattern and is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. The side edges of the axe have an almost rope pattern, with two raised areas, suggestive of twisted rope. Beneath the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. No blade facet is present.



The axehead measures 155.1 mm in length, 92.9 mm wide (blade), 28.1 mm wide (butt), 2.2 mm thick (butt), 12.4 mm thick (stop ridge), 2.0 mm thick (blade). It weighs 425.9 g.

Flat axes decorated with this 'rain pattern' and with crescentic blades can be found during the Willerby metalwork phase, dating from c.1875-1725 BC(Roberts et al, 2013, 23, fig.2.2) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 4 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 125, fig.26, no.53).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) also illustrate developed flat axes with crecentic bades and similar 'rain-pattern' decoration from Ryal and Keighley in plates 28-29, nos.329 & 340, which are classified, respectively, as a Type Falkland developed flat axe, which is compared to an axe from Mount Pleasant in Dorset, dated to c.1900 BC, and a Type Scrabo Hill which is associated with similar axes in the Willerby Wold hoards from East Yorkshire, illustrated in plate 134, nos.D1 & D4.



Several similar flat axeheads have been recorded on the PAS database. They include: CORN-5F6661; DENO-4F12EB; SWYOR-F748BE; SWYOR-6D80EC; and WMID-798FF7.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-07-31T23:00:00Z,2016-08-30T23:00:00Z,,,425.9,,,12.4,155.1,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Fradley and Streethay,SK1514,From finder,52.72344322,-1.77934858,WMID-2260B2,,wmid2260b2.jpg,Early Bronze Age: Complete decorated Flat axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/wmid2260b2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/609854.jpg

The chisel measures 64.56mm long. It is divided into two parts by a transverse rib. One part, the longer, at 34.30mm, is a rectangular sectioned tool measuring 4.76mm x 3.87mm in section below the rib and tapering to a gouge at the end which is S shaped in cross section. The other part of the implement is also square in section, 28.04mm in length. It measures 4.44mm x 4.05mm in section and tapers more sharply than on the other side, terminating in a narrow point.

The object is a sub-rectangular fragment of copper alloy, with a straight, horizontal break or cut at both the top and bottom ends. There is a broad, convex-surfaced mid-rib on either face, flanked by a pair of vertical grooves. Either side of this mid-rib the thickness gradually tapers towards the cutting edge. The blade is broken at either end. The breaks are well patinated and indicate that it was broken in antiquity.

841114,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"An almost complete cast copper alloy Middle Bronze Age rapier. The butt is incomplete and damaged which makes the original shape difficult to determine. Two C-shaped incomplete rivet holes or notches lie in the upper part of the butt, which is where the handle would have been attached. The notches are spaced approximately 24.82 mm apart. Slight shadow (shallowing of the metal) of the handle is visible just under the rivet holes extending centrally to the top of the break.

This widest point (49.52 mm) is at the shoulders. The blade extends c. 290 mm from the base of the butt and is approximately 30.61 mm wide at the very top, and narrows to 25.20 mm for much of the length of the blade, gradually narrowing further towards the tip of the blade (7.02 mm). The edge of the blade is damaged in several areas where small notches are missing. On either edge of the blade approximately 54.31 mm from the tip of the blade is a V-shaped notch (one is slightly more pronounced than the other and they are not quite parallel). These look intentional but may of course be damage.

Below the shoulder and extending into the blade, the edge is curved. This is apparent to one edge only as the other is badly disfigured with irregular notches, possibly the result of corrosion as there are large spots or pits close to the edge, presumably corrosion.

A central, clearly defined mid rib extends the length of the blade to the uppermost part of the butt and is slightly more pronounced on one face. The blade lozengiform in cross section.

The surfaces have a dark patina, though one face is very smooth and shows a golden-brown original surface colour. Both faces show heavy pitting along the entire surface of the object.

The total length of the object is 335 mm. The thickness varies along the blade from 6.85 mm towards the top, to 1.43 mm at the tip. It weighs 182 g (to the nearest 2 g).

842016,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Very late Bronze Age Hoard consisting of one gold bracelet, three gold penannular lock-rings and a cauldron fragment all found together in one find spot. The bracelet and two of the lock rings are stained possibly from an organic residue either from the soil or items placed with them. The lock-rings are all made from gold sheet face plates that are bi-conical in form and triangular in section with central tubes and side plates formed from the same sheet and secured by a binding strip of round sectioned gold wire fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding to the rim. The face plates are all decorated with fine, narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates imitating fine wire works. Two of the lock-rings only differ by 1cm in width and 0.1 gram in weight indicting that they are a pair The third smaller lockring is singular however the similar form indicates the same craftsman or at least a the same workshop. The gold bracelet and smaller lock-ring are stained with what could be corrosion products but appears more like organic residue possibly from something in the soil or organic substances included at the time of deposition.



Gold penannular bracelet with a lonzenge-shaped profile, no decoration and flattened slightly expanded to form plain circular terminals.The diameter is 68mm the width is 68mm thickness 6mm, 8mm at the terminals and the weight 66.15g. It shares similarities with a bracelet from Beachy Head in East Sussex  in the British Museum collection number 1824,K/Armilla.18.



Lockring 1. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 34mm the width is 34mm thickness 11mm and the weight 8.24g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.



A central circular opening to the ring - probably once approximately 15mm in diameter - is lined by a third sheet. In effect, this creates an interior but discontinuous tube, with a gap in the vertical plane for the terminal aperture. The top and bottom margins of the tube were folded over the interior rim of the two face plates, giving the ring some structural cohesion. It would appear that the triangular end faces at the terminals were once integral extensions to the interior tube.



The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly creased and misshapen and at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube there is a small tear in the sheet and the concentric circle decoration is damaged through surface scarring. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.



Lockring 2. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 34mm the width is 34mm thickness 10mm and the weight 8.34g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.



The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly creased and misshapen especially at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube and the concentric circle decoration is damaged through surface scarring. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.



Lockring 3. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 27mm the width is 27mm thickness 10mm and the weight 4.40g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.



The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly stained from a residue on the surface that could be corrosion but appears to be more like organic residue. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.



Cauldron fragment. The length is 27mm, the width is 31mm thickness 15mm and the weight 31.33g.



Lockrings are normally found in pairs leading to theories of their use as ear rings or for hair decoration. Although this find is unusual in that there are three however it is extremely likely that two are indeed a pair. It is still not clearly known what the purpose of these objects are however it does seem likely that they are indeed some form or ornamentation probably jewellery. They are usually buried in isolated high places and often in or near hillforts and other prehistoric features such as stone circles such as these were. Investigation of the find spot has revealed that they appear to have been laid in a small hollow in silty clay sub-soil or directly on the prehistoric land surface in two small channels in the limestone bed rock and covered over with stones. The bracelet appears to be a part of the deposition as does the copper alloy cauldron fragment although this could have been residual in the soil. However it's direct proximity to the other objects means that is has to be and should be included in the hoard assemblage.



Discussion



Lockrings are a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007).The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Eogan 1969, 106-7, 130-46; Cowie et al 1991; Northover 1995, 525-9; Needham et al 2008, 43). Recently, a radiocarbon date has been obtained from a sample directly associated with a large hoard of bronze artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland. The sample of wood, surviving within the haft of a socketed axe, provided a date of 2771+-26BP, calibrating to 1000-840BC at 2 sigma (Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution.



The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68-9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95-6; Lynch 1991, 239-41). What is generally agreed is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society. In Britain, the find-spots currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-western Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, Northern England and Southern Scotland and thirdly, East Anglia and south eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41). Their absence to date in the Midlands, mid and south Wales and south western England, with the single exception of one example from Somerset is marked and probably significant.



Gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC); they could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. The distribution of lock-rings shows a North British Group, a South British group, and a French group (Eogan 1969). The suggested date for this example is Late Bronze Age c.1150-800 BC. Similar penannular rings have been reported under the Treasure Act, for example 2014 T193 (ESS-C0C162) and 2012 T832 (SUSS-C65251).



There are currently six lockrings in the British Museum collections. These new examples are very similar to one from Portfield Camp, near Whalley in Lancashire even to the binding strip consisting of a solid round sectioned wire. Museum Number 1966, 1208:1.



They are also very similar to two discovered at Rossett in Wales in 2013 (LVPL-5DFE32) and semi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. Several readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6mA for 100 live seconds and quantified with the use of empirical calibrations. The average composition of the gold in freshly exposed and damaged areas was:- Gold 80-81%; silver 14%; copper 5%.The copper and silver contents matched with gold compositions from other Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts in Ireland and Wales, although the copper content is towards the lower end of the expected range for Late Bronze Age gold (e.g. Hartmann 1980, 158, Figs .12 & 36; Davis 2005, 36 & Fig. 4).

The object has a single midrib visible on both faces, a slight shield shaped pattern below the stop ridge and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan, with convex expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged, but appears to be symmetrical. The cutting edge measures 64.2 mm in width and is 3.0 mm thick.



In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. It measures 31.2 mm in width and 27.7 mm thick at the stop ridge.



Beneath the stop-ridge, on each face of the palstave, is a narrow concave depression, which is bordered by raised ridges. This is broadly sub-rectangular (U-shaped) and is usually described as shield shaped. It is visible on both sides, however it is obscured slightly on one face due to a casting flaw, an air bubble, being present. The shield measures 26.4 mm in width and 25.8 mm in length on the clearer face. Through this shield descends a vertical rib that extends to the mid point on the upper blade forming a trident like pattern.



The palstave has a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The flanges are incomplete. At the stop ridge on one face the flange measures 11.7 mm in depth. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 24.2 mm in width and 5.2 thick. No side loop is present.



Overall the palstave measures 169 mm in length, a maximum width of 64.2 mm, and a maximum thickness of 31.4 mm. It weighs 440.6 g.



The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.

The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group III type which has both a mid-rib and shield decoration forming a trident. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes). The axehead fits within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII and is likely to be part of the Acton Park II metalworking assemblage.

The blade-end is wide and convex, but not crescentic with pointed ends, like other types from the same period. The blade-end has a pointed oval cross-section, whereas the body of the blade is facetted, creating an elongated hexagonal cross-section; the butt is sub-rectangular in cross-section.

Discussion:



Lock-rings are Late Bronze Age ornaments made from gold plates, secured together by a binding strips to create a hollow and incomplete ring. The three gold plates, technically termed face plates, are sometimes decorated with repoussé decoration or with fine concentric incised lines imitating fine wire work. More infrequently, lock-rings are made from face plates formed or constructed from individual gold wires fused together or from striped twisted gold wires soldered together (Murgia et al. 2014). The Hambledon lock-ring is an example of solid face plates decorated with incised decoration. These are relatively rare. Eogan (1969) recorded only three examples (Ibid., fig.4, nos. 39-40, 43) and only two of these (both found between Haverhill and Saffron Walden in Essex) carry decoration that closely resembles the Hambledon find: interlocking chevrons.



A similar example of a triangular cross sectioned lock-ring can be found in ESS-5ECCA2 as well as three examples from LANCUM-C98FBF and two from LVPL-5DFE32.



Lock-rings are known across Britain, Ireland and North-West France (see Eogan 1994, fig. 41). The find is therefore consistent with the known distribution pattern.","As this object is more than 10% precious metal and is probably over 300 years old, The ring will fall under the Treasure Act of 1996.",3,Gold,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,,,2017T349,,2.97,,20.65,5.56,,1,Edwin Wood,Edwin Wood,South East,Hampshire,Winchester,Hambledon,SU6616,GPS (from the finder),50.93967503,-1.06203026,SUSS-5EA230,,PenRingSUSS5EA230.jpg,"A bronze Age gold, penannular ring",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/PenRingSUSS5EA230.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/613065.jpg

One of the terminals has been damaged and the copper alloy core exposed. The ring is circular in section with flat opposed terminals. The ring has a tiger striped colouration around the inside of the internal diameter. This is a patination found on other examples such as HAMP-C18814 and SUSS-EA6735.



These rings are often erroneously referred to as 'ring money' though there is no evidence to suggest that they were used as currency. They are predominantly believed to have been used for personal adornment, such as earrings or nose rings, they have even been suggested as hair ornaments.

A short fragment from a leaf-shaped sword blade of lentoid section with faint grooves on either side running parallel to the two cutting edges. The edges converge, suggesting this fragment to come from near the mid-part of the blade. The development of swords designed for a slashing action is attributed to the later Bronze Age. The broken edge at one end of the fragment is worn [bottom], but the opposite edge [top] is rough and may suggest a larger sword fragment has been further fragmented in recent times.

844078,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete developed flat axe with hammer raised flanges, of later Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2000 BC to c. 1700 BC).



The axehead is broadly rectangular, with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt is narrow and rounded and measures 14.2 mm in width and is 2.7 mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than cast flanges. The flanges extend 1.0 mm above the body of the axe head. The expanded blade measures 23.8 mm in width and is 2.5 mm thick.



The axehead measures 52.5 mm in length, maximum width of 23.7 mm (blade), minimum width 14.2 (butt), width 17.4 mm (centre). It is 2.7 mm thick at the blade, 2.7 mm thick at the butt, and 8.0 mm thick at the central point. It weighs 35.6 g.



The axehead is a dark brown colour, with an even but pitted surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



This axehead is similar to those recorded on the PAS database as DOR-28154A and NMS-370DE4, consistent with that of the Arreton type axe, of Early Bronze Age III dating, metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.



Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire) commented on DOR-28154A that the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 420, 423and 413). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The object appears complete and consists of a rectangular butt end which is 20mm wide and 6mm thick and extends for 46mm. This has flanged sides, which emerge from the butt end and widen until the object is 17mm thick at the point that these turn to form a stop. From here the object narrows out in thickness and widens out into a triangular shaped blade with a slightly curved edge. At the tip it is 57mm wide and 4mm thick. Each edge of the blade has a slight rounded lip and there is a rounded 'rib' running from the centre, where it emerges from the 'stop' dispaearring into the blade surface near its tip.

846394,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side profile of the axe is lentoid with both terminals tapering. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe appears to be undecorated. The butt end of the axe has been hammered flat creating a proto-stop ridge. The blade tip flares outwards from the body forming a concave hollow. The blade appears to be symmetrical. There is an obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge where it has been hammered for sharpening. The surface of the axe has a dark greenish-brown patina. The length is 104mm, the width of blade is 60mm, width of butt is 27mm, thickness 18mm and the weight 134.63g.

Description: It is unlooped with high, curved flanges, fused to the stop ridge. The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum height above the septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge). There is a molding seam (or ridge) running the middle length of the blade on each side edge although on edge it is obscured by corrosion).There are three longitudinal ridges decorating each face of the blade from the stop ridge unevenly along the blade. The object has suffered heavy pitted corrosion on one edge and a few other areas of the palstave. The blade edge and the butt end are bother highly uneven and abraded which may be evidence of plough damage but the level of wear makes this uncertain. Where it survives the patina is dark green to mid-brown color. The corrosion is a light green turquoise colour.



Measurements:  154.52mm long, 27.17mm wide (at the stop ridge), 58.51mm thick (at blade tip, 23.15mm thick at butt end)  450g (aproximately)



Discussion: http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axe: The term palstave is very misleading as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool not a type of axe. However the term is used in British archeology to describe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and as time went on developed loops. This example fits the Acton Park (phase 2) or Taunton phases palstaves whcih date it to c. 1500 - c. 1150 BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,450,,,58.51,154.52,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Tunbridge Wells,Pembury,TQ6343,Generated from computer mapping software,51.1630289,0.32981026,KENT-2EE95F,,KENT2EE95F.jpg,Palstave axe,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT2EE95F.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/614208.jpg

Overall, the shape is consistent with a side-looped socketed spear head, but not enough of the object remains for definite identification. The object may be the tip of a rapier - its cross-section is very similar to that of a rapier - but it is more likely to be the tip of a spearhead.

847420,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-1500,"A largely complete but corroded cast copper alloy flat axe of Early Bronze Age date (c. BC 2000 - 1700 ).



The flat axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan, widening to a gently splayed blade. In profile, it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The flat axe head has an overall length of 100.37mm and the axe weighs 142.6 grams. It should be noted that the axe is relatively small when compared to the corpus of known Early Bronze Age material. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 14.57mm with a thickness of 3.8mm. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved.There is no evidence of a median bevel; however, the axe is thickest at the mid point at 8.71mm. The sides of the blade expand to produce a blade edge width of 30.37mm. The blade edge has been damaged through either corrosion or wear.



There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe due to corrosion and patina. The axe is a mid green brown colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present.



This example is comparable with some of the earliest known copper axe and early bronze axes discovered in Britain.The axehead is likely to date from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age, and is comparable to Migdale axes although not containing all the attributes of the type. Many Migdale axes tend to have narrower butts which flare more at the cutting edge to crescent blades. Examples of similar Migdale axes can be found in Schmidt and Burgess 'The Axes of Scotland and Northern England'.

847481,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1750,-1550,"A fragment of early Bronze Age copper-alloy dagger or dirk, possibly of Camerton-Snowshill type (Period 4)  c.1750-1550 BC



Description: The dagger survives only as the point end and has linear decoration of six parallel lines creating a ribbing effect, on both sides, running either side of a mid-rib to meet below but on the same line as blade point. The dagger has a lozenge-shaped cross section and the break is ragged and appears to have happened in antiquity. Despite the break the blade is in relatively good condition save for a number of nicks along its edge. The blade is a dark brown and orange colour and is not showing particularly obvious signs of copper corrosion.



Measurements: 78.62mm long, 22.49mm wide, 3.25mm thick and 16.6g in weight



Discussion: This fragment likely relates to a dagger of early Bronze Age, specifically of Camerton-Snowshill type or a derivative thereof, these daggers relate to the end of the early Bronze Age (Period 4)  c.1750-1550 BC.","

847563,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A fragment of cast copper alloy socketed axe, dating to the Late Bronze Age - c. 1000 - 800 BC.



Description: The fragment represents part of the socketed end of the axe and is unevenly shaped. Part of the rimmed collar for the socket remains. Just after the rim there is a side loop to help secure the axe to its handle. There is substantial casting line running from the rim and along the mid-line of the loop onto the body of the axe. It appears this casting feature has had very limited finishing. The fragment is dark green on the surfaces and a light green on the breaks which may suggest the axe was broken while in the ground but a substantial time after its deposition.

848006,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-950,"An almost complete copper alloy palstave axe with an incomplete side loop. The palstave axe is dated to the Bronze Age period, dating from circa BC 1050 - BC 950.



The palstave is lozenge shaped in profile with a broadly rectangular blade end and triangular butt end in plan. The blade of the palstave has broadly parallel sides that flare slightly to form a crescent shaped cutting edge. The cutting edge measures 30.01mm in width and is 13.11mm thick. The blade is blunt and has been heavily worn, the cutting edge is now lost. The palstave was possibly reground several times owing to the lack of expanded blade at the edges. The widest section of the palstave is at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge on one face the axe has been decorated with three vertical ridges or ribs which are converging. The opposing face has no evidence of similar decoration although the surface is very worn.



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is broadly triangular in plan and profile and rectangular in cross section. The butt of the axe is narrowed and incomplete. The butt end measures 18.25mm in width and is 7.74mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is square in plan and measures 27.02mm in width. The side loop is incomplete and measures 27.9mm in length externally and is 11.9mm in length internally. Only the base of the loop remains on both sides which are broadly circular in section. The object has a mid-green coloured uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), illustrate similar examples which fit the Type Nettleham, plate 67, no 930, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 -BC 950. This marked a transition between palstaves and socketed axeheads. Other examples have been recorded on the PAS database including (WMID-306462) discovered in Staffordshire and (LIN-709F56) discovered in Nottinghamshire. Good parallels can also be seen from Hockenhul, Cheshire (LVPL-B27017) and also a mixed hoard of Late palstaves and socketed axes from Amport, Hampshire (HAMP-4DE734 etc). The nature of this hoard suggests this form of decorated axe has a potentially long life (well into the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). A distinctive pattern on their distribution has not been produced, however, Evans (1881) identifies a number of this form of axehead being discovered in the Welsh Marches specifically from Llandysilio (Denbighshire) and Fronheulog, Merionethshire (ibid: p92-93).



The object measures 126.20mmin length, is 32.32mmwide at the stop ridge. It has a maximum thickness of 23.93 mm at the stop ridgeand weighs 279.8 grams.

848748,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"A complete copper alloy probable Aylesford miniature type flat axehead of the Early Bronze Age period, probably dating from c. BC 2250 - c. BC 1900. This fits with Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.



The axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid (pointed oval) in shape. The edges of the axe have been damaged but much of it remains. The sides of the axe gently exapnd in width from the rounded rectangular butt to the blade. The edges of the axe have been raised slightly on both sides forming shallow flanges. There is a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) about a third of the way down the axe, this is present on both front and reverse faces but is clearer on the front face. The ridge is not especially prominent however there is a distinct bevel (change of angle) from butt to ridge and from ridge to blade Below the bevel the sides continue to exapnd. The area from the ridge to the blade junction shows evidence of being decorated. The decoration is in the form of a series of parrallel linear lentoid lozenges, these seem to be diagonal and seem to be angled in different directions, although this is difficult to see clearly. This form of decoration is known as rain patternand is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition and early Aylesford tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. The patination is heavily damged and abraded it is difficult to tell whether there is further decoratio. The decoration stops at the blade facet. Below the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade taper slightly to form a shallow crescent shaped blade, a distinct blade facet is present. The right edge of the blade on the front face shows signs of ancient damage, probably as a result of time and movement whilst within the plough soil.



The axehead measures 91.2 mm in length, the butt is 19.4 mm wide and the blade measures 39.7 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.5 mm, the ridge measures 7.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 87.8 g.



The axehead is a mid green to mid brown in colour with a highly polished patina which has been damage across much of the surface, especially on the reverse. Probably as a direct of the movement of the object whilst within the plough soil. There are, however, a series of large scars which have removed areas of decoration. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the decorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. This axehead forms part of the corpus of earliest developed bronze axes of Britain. Other broadly similar examples of this type of axehead have been recorded in Schmidt and Burgess (1981), plate 27, (or page 61), No 310 or 312.

Socketed spearhead. Bevelled, leaf-shaped blade, missing the tip and most of the cutting edge. The circular socket terminates in a jagged break which is not fresh, but is comparatively recent. It exhibits prominent casting seams down each long edge. Length: 97mm. Diameter of socket 14.2mm. Maximum extant width of blade: 17.1mm. Extant length of blade 74mm. Weight 35.3g.  

	
Fragment of socketed spearhead comprising part of the cylindrical socket. It exhibits the stubs of the cast side loops on either side, on the same line as the longitudinal casting ribs. The socket terminates in worn breaks at either end. Heavily pitted. Length: 29.7mm. It expands in diameter from 7.6mm to 12.2mm. Weight: 6.2g. 

	
 Tanged dagger or knife cut down from a dirk or rapier. Rectangular blade with a low central midrib and lozengiform cross-section. The butt end is rounded and has an off-centre rivet hole. The blade has a bend approximately halfway along its length, giving the blade a slightly S-shaped profile. This is likely to be post-depositional damage rather than deliberate. The blade terminates in a relatively fresh transverse break. Extant length: 90mm. Maximum width: 15.7mm. Thickness: 1.8mm. Weight: 15.1g. 

	
Ring. Undecorated, with a slight circumferential edge running around the outside. The inner edge exhibits a notch 14.1mm wide on one side, from wear. The surface is pitted and flaked in patches. External diameter: 34.2mm. Internal diameter: 21.4mm. Thickness: 5.8mm. Weight: 16.2g.

Discussion: Although the group was scattered over a wide area across a single field (see grid references), Neil Wilkin (Curator, Bronze Age Europe, pers. comms.) stated that the group appeared to consist of contemporary objects and should therefore be considered as a potential hoard. Nos. 1 – 3 can all be assigned a Middle to Late Bronze Age date. 



No. 3 is paralleled by a number of similar finds on the PAS database, particularly BERK-80BA1E. This record notes a comment from Dot Boughton that Burgess and Gerloff (1981) include a blade of similar shape and size in their Group II (Damaged Blades Modified for Rehafting), p. 36, Plate 32, no 248, described as ""Tanged blade, either a knife made in this form or possibly a dirk with butt cut down for rehafting, in which case the torn rivet hole would have been secondary…."" 



No. 4 is also likely to be contemporaneous. Similar rings have been discovered in a number of Bronze Age hoards and have been suggested as horse harness fittings; as being part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron, of Class A1 (Type Tul-na-cross) and Class B1 (Types Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg) (Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g); or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire.

851986,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1150,"A complete copper alloy bracelet of probable Middle Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age date. The bracelet is formed from a single bar of copper alloy that has been twisted to create a spiralling effect around much of its length. Towards the two terminal ends the wire is not twisted and instead is a short length of rectangular section. The terminals are hooked allowing the bracelet to be joined together. The wire terminates in a point on each terminal hook. Althogh now slightly distorted, it is evident that the closed diameter of the bracelet would have been very small.



Spiral torcs are known from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400-1200 BC) and twisted wire torcs and cabled bracelets from the Iron Age and Roman periods, however the form of this example suggests an early date. No direct comparison for the small size can be found on the PAS database nor in the usual literature however twisted torcs are a well-known artefact of the 'Ornament Horizon' period of the Middle Bronze Age. Of example recorded with the PAS there are two recently discovered spiral torcs from Hampshire (SUR-9A711C), while a much grander example from Wiltshire shows the skill of the manufacturers (WILT-12B9D2). The 'Near Lewes' hoard also exhibits a complete spiral torc (SUSS-C5D042). They all have the untwisted sections before hooked terminals.

852553,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side profile of the axe is lentoid with both terminals tapering. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe is decorated with short incised probably chiselled lines below the stop ridge and along the length to the blade. The butt end of the axe has been hammered flat creating a proto-stop ridge. The blade tip flares outwards from the body forming a concave hollow. The blade appears to be symmetrical. There is an obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge where it has been hammered for sharpening. The surface of the axe has a dark greenish-brown patina. The length is 133mm, the width of blade is 78mm, width of butt is 28mm, thickness 18mm.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length.

852556,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age small cast copper alloy flat axe with a narrow butt end and a slightly flanged blade, dating from the Early Bronze Age c. 2125-1950 BC. The edge of the blade of the axe appears to be unused, and the size of the axe suggests that it might have been used for votive reasons. The colour suggests that the axe is copper-rich and the original surface survives well in places, with patches of corrosion product and a few pits, and a few marks on one face of the blade. Otherwise the axe is in good condition. Flat axes with narrow butt ends with rectangular sections and slightly flanged blades can be found during the Brithdir metalwork phase (c.2150-2000 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 123, fig.24, no.34). Plain axes like this are also classified as Type Migdale which belong to 'Metalworking Assemblage III', corresponding to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 2 (c.2300-2050 BC).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar small flat axe from Patrington in plate 14, no.176, which is classified as a Type Migdale flat axe.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe from Salcombe in Devon, on pages 453 & 599, plate 38, no.289.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest small, slender Migdale type of flat axe to be recorded in the South West, from Bishop's Tawton in Devon, on page 87, pl.14, no.111.



The Migdale Phase is now dated from c.2125-1950 BC (Roberts et al. 2013, p.23, fig.2.2).

Description:The ingot is a plano-convex discoid shape possibly suggesting the production in a bowl furnace rather than a mould. The upper is flat but with a large knop or swelling relating to the casting gate used in its production. The bottom is a rounded convex shape. The ingot is heavily pitted likely due to a mix of impurities in its matrix and the uneven natural material used to create the bowl in which it was cast.



Measurements:121mm in diameter, 41.49mm thick and 1,225g in weight



Discussion:The bowl furnaces were developed during the Mediterranean Bronze Age, becoming popular in Britain in the Late Bronze Age and were used intermittently to the modern era for many types of metal. It becomes much rarer in the production of copper-alloy after the Roman Period. Iron Age and Roman bun ingots tend to be much heavier than those of the bronze age often weighing upwards of 12kg, this example weighing only 1.25kg would be suggestive of a late Bronze Age date.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,1225,,121,41.49,,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Canterbury,Barham,TR2149,GPS (from the finder),51.19745492,1.16182545,KENT-14DDA6,,KENT14DDA6.jpg,Copper-alloy bun ingot of likely late Bronze Age date,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT14DDA6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/618980.jpg

853136,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-850,"A complete cast copper-alloy tanged chisel of Late Bronze Age date. The chisel is in good condition and appears undamaged, with evidence for use wear on the blade tip and edge. The chisel has a tapering square-sectioned tang which abuts the round-sectioned, collared handle stop of the chisel blade. The collar is 13.5 mm diameter. From the collar the chisel blade, which is broadly triangular in plan, flattens in profile and expands to a thin cutting edge with slightly flared shoulders. The cutting edge is 27.5 mm wide. The object is in very good coniditon and has a mid-brown patina across much of its surface.



Tanged chisels, which date from c. 1150-850 BC, are known from several hoards and as isolated finds; complete examples from such contexts are uncommon. Three other complete tanged chisels from Oxfordshire are of almost identical form; on this database an example from South Oxfordshire (see BERK-52E8C3), from Noke (BERK-D3E079) and another illustrated in Evans (1881:168 no. 193) from Wallingford (formerly Berkshire).

The object is broadly a thin pointed oval shape in plan. It is double ended, with one end being circular in section while tapering to a sharp rounded point. The opposing end is broadly rectangular in section while thinning to a chisel-like point, though the tip of the latter is broken away in old damage. The centre of the object is broadly square in section. 



The object measures 62.8 mm in length. It measures 4.9 mm wide in the centre, is 2.4 mm wide at the rounded point terminal and is 4.25 mm wide at the chisel like terminal. It has a thickness in the centre of 4.7 mm, measures 2.0 mm thick at the rounded terminal and is 1.7 mm thick at the chisel like terminal. It weighs 5.8 g. 



The object is a dark brown in colour with an even patina. There are areas of light green colouring which may be copper corrosion products. Abrasion caused by movment whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.

The spearhead comprises a leaf shaped blade with chamfered edges and a conical socket with two circular peg holes; one to either side of the socket which are positioned in line with the blade.

856173,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-900,-800,"Description:



A complete cast copper-alloy socketed hammer, probably dating the late Bronze Age 'Ewart Park' phase (c.900-800 BC).



Whilst the hammer is sub-rectangular in cross-section, viewed in plan from above the hammer is rectangular, and the convex sides are sub-rectangular. The hammer is section waisted, expanding into a flared collar, with four concentric grooves (or three bands or 'ribs') encircling the base of the flared socket end. The socket mouth is sub-circular whilst the interior void appears to taper toward the hammer end. Casting lines running along the upper and lower face of the hammer indicate that it was cast in two parts. These casting marks have mostly been removed or ground out; however, they are clearly visible at the point at which the four concentric grooves meet. The hammer tapers sharply from the socket toward the mid-point, before again flaring more gently toward the hammer face. The striking face of the hammer shows evidence of extensive use-wear, with a pronounced uneven slant visible, together with numerous nicks and gouges.



The hammer has a dark brown patina and, with the noted exception of contemporary use-wear, is in excellent condition with no obvious signs of active corrosion.



Discussion:



The earliest socketed hammers are recovered from Middle Bronze age contexts, such as those described by Rowlands (1976a and b) and Eogan (1964 274-5) from the Irish 'Bishopland Phase' (approximately contemporary to the Taunton Phase, c.1400-1250BC). However, hammers are more commonly found in association with Late Bronze Age hoards (Rowlands, 1976), as the hammer above was. Burgess (1968, 19) notes that later examples are ""invariably embellished, usually with some form of collar"". The concentric ribs on the example under discussion here could be interpreted as a form of collar; the collar is, however, much clearer on the hammers recorded on the PAS database as YORYM-ABCCE1 and FAKL-9C9543. Nevertheless, the latter examples are the closet parallels thus far recorded by the PAS, particularly as they too have circular sockets. Burgess (ibid) further notes that few parallels exist for the ""longer socketed hammer"" in Northern Britain, of which the hammer described above is likely to be an example. However, it is noticeably shorter by c.20mm than similar long socketed hammers, including hammer LVPL-5A6D83. In common with the majority of these examples, and the remainder of Hoard 2015-T566/DUR-1F5057 (with which the hammer was found; see below) a date consistent with the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park Phase (c.900-800 BC) is likely. At the time of writing, the hammer constitutes the furthest north recorded example on the PAS database, and the first recovered from Co. Durham.



Note:



The hammer was found with Bronze Age Hoard (2015-T566; DUR-1F5057) and was initially thought to be unrelated. However, the object has since been identified as a late Bronze Age hammer, and has been reported as Treasure on the basis that is was found in the same place as, and had previously been together with, another object that is Treasure (that is, the hoard 2015-T566; DUR-1F5057) and thus falls under the stipulations of the 1996 Treasure Act.

856345,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"Looped palstave of Gr.III (Low-flanged, broad-bladed) type (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981). It dates broadly to the Middle Bronze Age and more specifically to the Taunton/early Penard phases (1400-1200 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).



This is a complete palstave with leaf-shaped flanges that rise from the septum below the butt to about the height of the stop. It has a long slender butt, with a straight end and a thick septum (c.10mm). In plan, the flanges form a straight, rectangular stop ridge and taper in very slightly toward the butt end. A thick side loop is positioned on one side overlapping the stop ridge.



The blade is broad and crinoline in shape, with a curved cutting edge and faint signs of a bevelled edge. The bevelling and curvature of the cutting edge indicates it was worked, which is supported by the slightly asymmetrical form of the edge. This may be the resulting of casting, uneven working or resharpening. There are no macroscopic sharpening or grinding striations visible. Both faces are adorned with a raised midrib, extending from below the stop about halfway down the blade (44.6mm long); it is more pronounced on one face than the other.



There is a lateral flattened ridge down each side of the palstave, which indicates the remains of the casting flash which has been ground and hammered down, though it is particularly prominent around the side loop. Furthermore, there is a shallow shrinkage hollow in the septum at the stop on one face, which is a common flaw for palstaves, caused as the metal cools after casting.



The palstave is covered in an even, consistent pale brown patina preserving the original surface. Active pale green corrosion is visible in small patches, particularly around the edges and fresh bronze can be seen on one side of the cutting edge indicating post-recovery damage. Patches of dark blue corrosion product can be seen on the septum on one face.



Dimensions: Length: 167mm; Blade width 65.1mm; Butt width: 18.3mm; Stop breadth: 35.3mm; Stop width: 22.7mm; Flange breadth: 33.1mm; Flange height: 10mm; Weight: 503.4g.","A wide variation of palstave types are known from throughout the Middle Bronze Age and this example has characteristics most similar with those from the Taunton phase (1400-1275 cal. BC), but could extend into the Penard phase (1275-1100 cal. BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

Close parallels for this palstave are difficult to identify though. While it appears to fall broadly within Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Group III Low-flanged, it does not conform to any of their sub-types or variants. The combination of a broad crinoline blade, side loop and midrib is unusual. Additionally, the breadth of the flanges is quite large (33.1mm) - typically one would expect low flange breadth to fall below 31mm. In southern Britain, it most closely matches Rowlands (1976) Class 5, Group 1 of broad-bladed looped palstaves. Parallels with lower flanges can be seen in his catalogue from Watchingwell on the Isle of Wight (Rowlands 1976, No.576, Pl.31) and Northamptonshire (ibid, No.811, Pl.30). A similar palstave from Wales is recorded from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-CF16C3), though that example has a flared, triangular blade and lower flanges.



The most similar example in terms of form and dimensions was found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012).

These artefacts tend to be identified as chisels, i.e. wood-working tools, such as in WREX-9F314E. However, they resemble (in size and shape) Earliest Iron Age so-called socketed chisels (SUR-2B05A8) which have now been reinterpreted as leather-working knives. Thus, the earlier tanged examples may be better identified as leather-working knives owing to their often thin, wide blades (IOW-383C47 and WAW-CEC22C).

The remains of two rivet holes survive only partially on the upper heavily worn and eroded external edge of the hilt. The hilt is broadly is trapezoidal in shape. The width of the blade at the break is 16.79mm and the measurement between the rivet holes is 25.89mm. There is no evidence of a raised or cast mid-rib to the blade



The distinction between dirks and rapiers is difficult when the fragment is as small as this example - the main difference between a dirk and a rapier is that a Rapier is over 30cm long and therefore considered to be more of a thrusting weapon whilst a Dirk is under 30cm and so more useful for stabbing. However it is often difficult to identify whether a blade is a dirk or a rapier as they are frequently found in a fragmentary state. From the size of this example it is more likely to have been from a dirk (dagger). Good PAS examples can be seen from Bampton, Oxfordshire (GLO-036A39), and Flawborough, Nottinghamshire (DENO-C2BC23).

857031,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"A small cast socketed (probably side-looped) spearhead, dating probably from the early Middle Bronze Age, c.1600-1400BC.



The object has a broken blade of indented quadrilateral section. There is a prominent longitudinal mid-rib on both sides and abraded cutting edges. Approximately one third of the blade has been broken off. A deep sub-circular socket of 6.04mm diameter is present. Much of the original surface has corroded and is lost; however, that which survives has a mid-brown patina. the remiainder of the object has a mottled green-grey patina.



The head measures 5.9mm in length and 15.96mm wide at its widest point. The blade is 10.07mm thick at the rib and weighs 15.5g.



It is most likely that the object is a spearhead as described above, the spear having being broken at the base resulting in the loss of the side loops. As such the record for similar spearhead LANCUM-7609C0 states that: ""Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.""



Whilst rare, there exists the possibility that the object could be an arrowhead. Information on the database states that ""Socketed arrowheads, whilst originally noted as being absent from UK finds have appeared across England, with the majority being found in the Midlands, with an example each from North Yorkshire and Shropshire.

857591,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Early Bronze Age hoard of two incomplete flanged axes and one spearhead.



1. and 2. Class 5Db Long-flanged axe (2 conjoining fragments)



Dimensions: surviving length blade fragment 1 - 71.9mm; surviving length butt fragment 2 - 28.2mm; combined total length approx.108.8mm; blade width (fragment 1) - 47.9mm; butt width fragment 2 - 21.0mm; maximum thickness at flanges (fragment 1 ) - 17.5mm; maximum height of flanges (fragment 1) - 3.0mm; weight fragment 1 - 154.1g; fragment 2 - 28.3g; combined weight 182.4g.



These are two conjoining fragments of a complete, slender, bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and near parallel, although there is a subtle impression of a curved and waisted effect, created by the curvature of the sides and inward curving effect of the flanges. The sides curve out suddenly to an expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The butt shows some curvature, although with sub-angular corners, rather than truly arched form. Approximately 54mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges rise approximately 3mm above the septum on each face. The sides of the axe are evenly curved and undecorated. Striations running parallel with the blade edge on the blade bevels indicate that the axes was sharpened for use. The break surfaces on the two fragments are soil covered and do not appear to be recent. The overall patina is dark green, although with extensive mottled patches of lighter blue-green and pitting evident on all faces and along edges.



3. Long flanged axe butt fragment (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 62.0mm; butt width 19.8mm; maximum thickness at flanges 13.4mm; maximum surviving height of flanges approx. 1.5mm; width at break 24.3mm; weight 79.7g.



This is a butt and mid-section of a slender bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides are straight but slightly divergent. The butt is high arched and with a pinched tapering form in side view. The flanges are worn and rise a maximum of 1.5mm above the septum. The sides are curved and undecorated, although one side has slight angularity suggesting uneven hammering. Approximately 47.5mm from the butt, there is a median bevel across both faces. Across the break, the axe reveals an asymmetry in cross-section, with one side and flanges narrower than the other. On one side, the thickness, including flanges, is 13.4mm and the septum is 9.7mm thick, while on the other, the thickness including flanges is 12.0mm and the thickness of the septum is 9.1mm. Some of this asymmetry, most marked near the break, may have been created by the forcible twisting and breaking of the axe, causing localised deformation of the metal. The break surface is soil covered and the break was made in antiquity. The axe has a dark grey-green patination, with areas of mottled pitting with lighter blue-green corroded surfaces.



4. Type 2A Decorated Early Pegged and Socketed Spearhead 



Dimensions: length 196.0mm; maximum width blade 33.8mm; external diameter socket 22.8mm (side to side) by 22.1mm top to bottom; maximum blade thickness (base) 13.2mm; depth of socket approx.. 82.5mm; diameter peg holes (1) 6.8mm (side to side) by 4.7mm (top to bottom); (2) 7.2mm (side to side) by 4.4mm (top to bottom); weight 179.9g



This is a complete bronze spearhead with a triangular shaped blade, tapering near the point. The blade has a narrow and prominent lozenge midrib and the blade is enclosed by a raised bevel, with deep blade channels and a V-shaped raised base. The base of the blade edges merge with the oval-shaped socket with shallow concave curves. The socket retains angularity down both sides, in line with the blade edges, only becoming indistinct near the mouth. The base of the socket shaft extends only to the base of the blade and the blade is solid cast. Near the socket mouth (5-7mm from the mouth edge), are tow oval shaped peg-holes, each with recessed external borders.



The socket of the spearhead has been decorated on both sides, although it is better preserved on one face and indistinct on the other. At the top and beneath the V-shaped blade base, an incised V-shaped pair of parallel lines, approximately 2.5m apart, is infilled with short parallel lines. Beneath this, a banded decorative schema is aligned at right angles to the axis of the spear and parallel with the socket mouth edge. The first decorative band is a single zone of infilled chevrons, enclosed by two incised lines approximately 3mm apart. Between this and the next zone of decoration is a plain band, bordered by a second double band of decoration, 5mm wide and comprising three parallel incised lines, each infilled with angled and parallel lines all of the same alignment. Following a further plain band, is a third, single zone of infilled chevrons, defined by two lines. The fourth and final banded decoration, comprises two linear incised bands, with a herringbone infilled pattern of parallel lines. At the lower margin, bordered by the socket mouth edge, a short stretch of shorter incised, and angled dash marks defines the edge. The upper band of decoration abuts the lower margins of each peg-hole, although it is not possible to say whether the decoration was applied before or after the peg-holes were shaped.



There are striations visible on the blade bevel, running parallel to the blade edge in places, suggesting sharpening for use. On one face, one of the lateral blade channels has been markedly deepened with an angular striation, possibly created in antiquity during preparation of the blade edges. On one upper socket face, there is a rectangular shaped punched depression set into the face. Localised deformation above and below this, suggests this may have been deliberate and forcible damage, either during use, or immediately before deposition. There is a split in the wall of the socket mouth on one side. One or two scratches and scrapes appear to have been made during the recent past, during ploughing or retrieval from the soil. The surfaces of the spearhead are extensively pitted and the spearhead has a dark grey-green patination.","The two Class 5 long-flanged axes and the Early Pegged and Socketed Spearhead within this artefact group may all be dated to the same Arreton phase (Period 4, Metalwork Assemblage VI) of the Early Bronze Age (e.g. Northover unpublished, 104-13; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-5; Needham et al 1985, iii; Needham 1996, 132-3; Rohl & Needham 1998, 91-2). They are contemporary with the Wessex 2 rich grave tradition and Camerton-Snowshill dagger and knife series across southern Britain, now independently radiocarbon dated to 1750/1700-1500 BC (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 179-80; Needham & Woodward 2008, 7, Fig. 3; Needham et al 2010, 364-5 & Table 1; Woodward & Hunter 2015, 462).



The complete flanged-axe (Nos. 1 & 2 above) best correlates with Type Arreton long-flanged axes most densely distributed across southern, eastern and south-western England (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 176-8, Figs. 6 & 7; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 72-5, Cats. 408-25B; Needham 1985; Needham et al 1985, iii; Northover unpublished Cats. 95-108). When the critical measurements for these flanged axes are applied within Needham's metrical classification of Class 5 axes for central and southern Britain (Needham 1983, 198-250), it appears to fit within the parameters of Class 5Db axes, with their narrow blade edges, while its relative flange height of 0.03714 sits within the range for true Class 5 flanged axes (Needham 1983, 65-6 & 198, Figs. 72-6).



The butt fragment of a long-flanged axe (Nos. 3 above) also exhibits attributes most closely correlated with a Type Arreton long-flanged axe: narrow form, cast flanges, a high arched butt with pinched tapering form in side section and a median bevel (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 72). The surviving flange heights, at 1.5mm, are low for a true Class 5 flanged axe, although they may once have been higher and they do look to be cast rather than hammered. Given the absence of a blade end for this fragmentary axe, it is not possible to allocate it to sub-class on metrical grounds (Needham 1983, 198-250). The asymmetry of this flanged axe in cross-section is interesting and may indicate forcible twisting and breaking prior to deposition.



The spearhead (No. 4 above) may be identified as an Early Socketed Spearhead of Group 2 and Type 2A of Pegged form (Davis 2012, 40-1). This example may be closely paralleled with examples from Colwick, Nottinghamshire, Twickenham, London West Row Fen, Suffolk and Stow cum Quy, Cambridgeshire (Davis 2012, 41, Cats. 50, 53-5, Plates 5-6). Decorated examples of both pegged and looped forms of Early Socketed Spearheads are a repeating occurrence. A number have banded decoration on their sockets, while infilled chevron designs, as one the Wenvoe example, have also been previously observed (Davis 2012, Cats. 49, 50, 52, 54, 60, 64, 66, 74-6 & Pls.5-7).



The finder's account of the discovery of these artefacts indicate that the two conjoining fragments of flanged axe (Nos. 1 & 2 above) were found within 2m of each other at a depth of 20-25cm beneath the surface. The flanged axe butt fragment (No. 3 above) was found at a similar depth but approximately 8-10m to the south-south-west and following the line of modern ploughing of the field. The spearhead (No. 4 above) was found at a very shallow depth of just 2-3cm (1 inch), immediately after later deep ploughing of the field. It was located some 13-15m away from the first two flanged axe fragments, to the north-north west and nearer to the field hedge line and lane bordering the field to the north. It is probable that these artefacts had been buried together and at the same time during the Early Bronze Age as a hoard group, possibly in a shallow and isolated pit. The original hoard was probably disturbed and dispersed by the farmer during recent ploughing activity, who was also the finder in this instance.

857956,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of two spearheads and five socketed axes.



1. Plain Pegged spearhead, with lanceolate blade
Dimensions: surviving length 146.3mm; maximum surviving blade width 44.7mm; surviving blade length 115.7mm; maximum surviving external diameter of socket 26.5mm (side to side) by 26.2mm (top to bottom); maximum surviving internal diameter of socket 21.2mm (side to side) by 21.1mm (top to bottom); surviving depth of socket approx. 93.0mm; diameter of peg-holes approx. 5.8mm; surviving weight 142.6g.

Lanceolate shaped pegged spearhead with incomplete socket below peg-holes. The blade has a pronounced central rib, which tapers markedly at the lower blade, rather than tapering evenly along the blade. The socket is slightly sub-angular at top, base and sides, giving a socket cross-section which is not perfectly circular and has very slight angles. The blade has bevelled edges and at the widest point of the blade, the wing to bevel outline appears to have a slight change of angle, from a continuous convex curve, however there is no break in the slightly convex curve of the upper blade. The spearhead is of medium length, with blade wings of modest width, but marked thickness. The casting seam on the socket is visible but has been carefully filed or hammered down. The peg-holes appear to be near circular, although only part of their diameters survive, as the socket and mouth end has been broken away across the peg-holes. On the blade wings and bevels, striations parallel with the rib and blade edges are evident, suggesting sharpening and preparing for use. The spearhead appears slightly bent in side-section, suggesting impact during use or retrieval from the ground. The artefact has a grey-green patina, with pale powdery green, tip, edges and at the socket break. On the lower blade surfaces there are patches of green and blue concretions.



2. Plain Pegged spearhead fragment, with lanceolate blade 
Dimensions: surviving length 134.8mm; maximum surviving blade width 40.5mm; surviving blade length 134.8mm; surviving internal diameter of midrib aperture at base of blade 16.1mm (side to side) by 14.7mm (top to bottom); surviving depth of socket approx. 84.0mm; surviving weight 113.8g.

Lanceolate shaped pegged spearhead blade, with tip and socket missing. The blade has a pronounced central rib, which tapers suddenly at the lower blade, rather than tapering evenly along the blade. The mid-rib aperture at the base of the blade is slightly oval, widest from side to side. Traces of blade bevels can be seen towards the base of the blade, however most have not survived. The spearhead was once of long and narrow proportions, longer than the other spearhead. Marked linear striations can be observed at the base margins of the mid-rib, and there are also less marked striations on the blade wings, with an alignment parallel to the mid-rib and blade edges. The spearhead has a green patina, with areas on light green powdery surface along blade-edges and breaks. Both blade surfaces have areas of copper carbonate concretions adhering.



3. South Wales Variant type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 100.8mm; surviving blade width 39.5mm; width below loop 39.5mm; surviving external mouth dimensions 49.6 by 38.2mm; internal mouth dimensions 31.7 by 28.6mm; depth of socket approx. 82.0mm; surviving weight 191.8g.

A near complete slender axe, with one face heavily damaged and missing original surfaces and unstable and heavily eroded blade edge and mouth. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding, from which a narrow loop descends. Three parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face, continuing down four-fifths of the remaining length of the blade, almost to the blade facet. The ribs are prominent but discontinuous, suggesting the mould pieces used to cast the axe were old. The face edges have also been raised, to give the effect of a five ribbed axe. The axe is rectangular in section, but slender, the sides of the axe parallel down to the damaged blade edge. The mouth is rectangular in shape and heavily eroded, making runner stubs difficult to discern, however one raised area, opposite the loop side, suggests a runner stub. The socket is misaligned with the exterior of the axe, with a small hole on one lower blade face indicating a differential thinning in wall thickness in places. The casting seams down both sides are prominent, but slightly blunted by hammering and the excess flashing within the loop was never trimmed, perhaps hinting that the axe may never have been used before being buried. Original surfaces have a green-brown patina, while eroded surfaces are light green, unstable and powdery. The axe is in poor state, showing laminating and cracking of original surfaces remaining. On the interior surface of the socket, there is an area of blue corrosion surface.



4. South Wales type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 92.6mm; surviving blade width 44.1mm; width below loop 37.1mm; external mouth dimensions 50.5 by 39.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 31.1 by 28.0mm; dimensions projecting runner stub (1) 9.7 by 5.4mm; height 1.0mm; dimensions runner scars (2) 8.6 by 4.1mm; (3) 6.7 by 4.1mm; depth of socket approx. 68.0mm; surviving weight 209.0g.

A near complete axe with broken loop with concave, diverging sides, flaring towards the blade end. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding from which the narrow loop descends. Three converging ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending down two thirds of the surviving blade. These are ill-defined, but continuous ribs, hinting that the mould pieces used to cast this axe were old. The axe is sub rectangular in section, though the upper face edges are sub-rounded. The casting seams down each side are prominent, having only received cursory hammering preparation, while the flash beneath the loop was never trimmed, suggesting the axe may never have been used before being buried. The heavy mouth is sub-oval in external plan, while the internal aperture is sub-rectangular. One runner stub and two runner scars are evident around the mouth, indicating a four-runner casting technology. Along the surviving blade facet on both sides, there are striations running parallel with the blade edge, suggesting some preparation of the blade took place. Across the mid to lower end of one face, a structural crack is evident, running parallel with mouth and blade edge and continuing as far as the mid-point casting seam. This appears to have been a failure in the casting process, relating to one half of the mould. A further crack descends from the mouth down the same face, but this may have been damage caused since burial. On the reverse side, there are two small surface pits, suggesting air bubbles trapped within the original casting. The original surfaces of the axe have a grey-green patina, while the blade edge, parts of the mouth, loop break and small areas of faces have powdery light-green eroded surfaces.



5. Ribbed socketed axe fragment 
Dimensions: surviving length 97.1mm; surviving blade width 48.2mm; width below loop 38.9mm; internal mouth dimensions at break approx. 32.6 by 27.3mm; depth of socket approx. 70.0mm; surviving weight 172.6g.

Large axe fragment missing mouth and loop. The sides are concave, flaring outwards slightly towards the blade end. The axe has a markedly rounded body, with an oval shaped cross-section and rounded face edges. Near the break, there is evidence of a flared mouth-moulding, but this is subtle and faint, rather than prominent. Three well-defined and near parallel ribs descend from the moulding down both faces of the blades, extending down three-quarters of the length of the surviving blade. Between these ribs there are feint and smooth ridges and grooves in the surfaces, aligned parallel with the ribs. These indicate probable shaping irregularities in the walls of the mould halves used to cast this axe. The casting seams down each side are visible, but have been hammered down and on one side, hammer facets can be observed along the surface. On one side, where original surface survives, striations can been seen on the blade facet running parallel with the blade edge, suggesting the blade was prepared. The original surfaces of the axe have a green-brown patina, while the upper face, upper break and blade edges have powdery light-green eroded surfaces. In the lower socket, there are green surface carbonate concretions on one side.



6. Ribbed socketed axe fragment - probable South Wales type 
Dimensions: surviving length 88.1mm; surviving blade width 43.8mm; width below loop 38.6mm; depth of socket approx. 70.0mm; surviving weight 130.7g.

Large fragment of a ribbed socketed axe, missing one side, mouth and loop. The axe has straight and slightly divergent sides, with slight expanding at the blade end. The axe has a blocky and rectangular shaped body in cross-section, and angled face edges, with a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding. Three convergent ribs descend from the underside of the prominent mouth moulding on the surviving face, and extending down three quarters of the surviving length of the blade. On the opposite face, the ends of three ribs can be seen just below the break point. The casting seams are visible down both sides of the axe, through were hammered down, while a lower loop stub survives on one side. Slight denting to the blade surface, just below the break on one side hints at the possibility that this axe may have been broken through hammering prior to burial and the break edges here are non-eroded and soil covered. Large parts of the face have a black surface patina, possibly deliberately coloured and applied by the makers. The lower blade has a grey-green patina, while the blade edge and parts of the mouth have powdery light-green eroded surfaces. On the mouth, one small area of break shows exposed and fresh bronze, suggesting the mouth was clipped and accidentally broken by the finder during its retrieval.



7. South Wales type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 91.3mm; surviving blade width 40.3mm; width below loop 40.1mm; surviving external mouth dimensions 52.3 by (36.5)mm; surviving internal mouth dimensions 35.3 by (25.4mm); dimensions projecting runner stubs (1) 9.7 by 4.8mm; height 1.0mm; (2) 9.2 by 4.7mm; height 0.5mm; depth of socket approx. 56.0mm; surviving weight 227.9g.

Near complete socketed axe, missing part of mouth and original blade edge, with slightly divergent but straight sides and a rectangular shaped cross-section. The axe has a prominent mouth moulding, from which a narrow loop descends. Three near parallel ribs descend from the mouth moulding on each face. On one face, the ribs are short, extending less than half the length of the surviving blade, while on the other, the ribs are slightly placed at an angle to the side faces and are longer, descending down two-thirds of the surviving length of the blade. The ribs are not well-defined, suggested that the mould parts used to cast this axe were old. The heavy mouth has an oval-shaped exterior edge, while the interior aperture is sub-rectangular with rounded edges. Two runner stubs survive at 90 degrees to each other, indicating this axe was cast with a four-runner casting technology. The casting seams are prominent down both sides of the axe, but were briefly hammered down to remove sharp edges. On one side, there are angled striations on the lower blade surface, but these were probably created after burial, rather than being evidence for preparation of the axe for use. The original surfaces have a grey-green patina, while there are areas of powdery light-green surface around the mouth, along the blade edge and in eroded patches on one lower blade face.","The two bronze spearheads (Nos. 1 & 2, above) may be identified as of the Plain Pegged spearhead form with lanceolate blades. Plain Pegged spearheads, as an artefact class, generally span in date from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age and dating to between 1300-800BC (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of similar Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard, Guilsfield and Princetown hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of slightly later Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800BC. The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period (Needham et al 1997, 93-8). Therefore, these spearheads are thought on stylistic grounds to date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000BC and 800BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3).

Three of the socketed axes reported may be identified as South Wales Type socketed axes or Variant forms (No. 3, 4 & 7, above), while another fragment is probably part of another South Wales type socketed axe (No. 6, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their Variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004).



One ribbed axe fragment (No. 5, above) is not entirely diagnostic to type, missing its mouth and loop. Its rounded body and oval-shaped cross-section, together with a gradually flaring mouth, without a step-change in slope, are features which suggest that this was not a South Wales Type socketed axe of classic form, although it is possible that this may have been from a South Wales Variant form. Alternatively, it is equally possible that this may once have been an example of a Class B - Southern English ribbed axe, of B3 form with three ribs and trumpet-mouthed (Needham 1990, 33 & 36, Fig. 4.23).

858124,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-750,"An incomplete Bronze Age copper alloy socketed axe head, probably dating to c. 950-750 BC. The surviving section comprises of the cutting edge, now highly abraded, and blade, with the mouth, loop and collar all lost to an abraded, but patinated break. The axehead is broadly trapezoidal in plan, 82.3mm long and expanding from a 36.4mm wide at a worn break to 53.8mm wide at the cutting edge. The object is triangular in profile, tapering from 26.3mm thick at the break to 21.3mm at approximately the mid-point, before continuing to terminate in a point at the cutting edge. In cross section the axehead is rectangular, wit the internal socket being sub-rectangular in cross section. The walls of the axehead appear relatively thin, c. 3mm thick, although thickneing into the corners. The socket survives to a depth of 58.0mm.



The sides of the axehead expand in a gradual, shallow curve, and although now worn, the cutting edge seems unlikely to have flared significantly and is convex. The faces of the axehead are plain, with no indication of ribs or other decoration. Raised casting seams are present on both sides, which appear to be unfaceted. With the exception of the cutting edge, where it has flaked away, the surface of the object survives well, with a rich brown patina.



Overall dimensions: length 82.3; width 53.8mm; thickness 26.3mm; weight: 217.39g.



The tapering, rectangular cross section of the blade and its lack of decoration would suggest that the axehead dates to the Late Bronze Age, contemporary with South-eastern type axes (Pearce 1984: 34), whilst most likely of the Ewart Park phase (compare, for example CAM-3FFFA1 and WMID-B61E05 on this database), given the fragmentary nature fo the axehead a more precise classification is difficult.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2017-07-13T23:00:00Z,,,217.39,,,26.3,82.3,1,Wil Partridge,Wil Partridge,South West,Devon,Torridge,Broadwoodwidger,SX4089,GPS (from the finder),50.67860757,-4.26599355,DEV-7A77C7,,DEV7A77C7.JPG,Bronze age socketed axe fragment,Somerset County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEV7A77C7.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/623401.jpg
858133,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard comprising 12 complete and fragmentary socketed axes.



1. South Wales type socketed axe
Dimensions: length 109.5mm; surviving blade width 51.3mm; width below loop 43.0mm; external mouth dimensions 58.8 by 46.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 34.5 by 26.0mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 10.6 by 7.3mm; height 0.2mm; (2) 11.7 by 8.1mm; height 1.0mm; (3) 9.3 by 5.5mm; height 0.2mm; dimensions of runner scar (4) 8.6 by unknown; depth of socket approx. 75.0mm; surviving weight 439.5g.

This is a virtually complete, heavy and long socketed axe with a blocky rectangular shaped cross-section. The sides are slightly divergent and with slight concave curves and little expansion and recurving at the blade end. The axe has a prominent and out-splayed mouth moulding, with a high and narrow loop descending from the underside. Three near parallel ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending approximately down two-thirds of the face. On one face, the ribs are discontinuous and less well defined, suggesting one of the mould pieces used for casting the axe was old. The face edges are sub-angular. The mouth is heavy and wide topped, with a sub-rectangular shaped external shape and a sub-rectangular internal aperture with rounded corners. Three filed runner stubs and a runner scar are evident around the mouth, each located 90 degrees apart, indicating the axe was cast using a four-runner technology. The casting seams down each side are prominent, but have been rapidly hammered to remove sharp edges. The two mould halves are very slightly misaligned, creating a slight offset between the two halves, and making the width below the loop slightly wider than originally planned. Towards the blade end on the non-loop side, there is an excess of projecting metal, indicating a slight casting flaw, which would not have impacted on the functioning of the axe as a tool. There are small circular pits on the surfaces of the axe, probably created as bubbles within the bronze as it was cast. There are linear striations running along the blade bevel, parallel with the blade edge, indicating the axe was sharpened for use. One blade-edge side has been damaged and removed, however the rest of the blade edge has survived reasonably well. Most original surfaces of the axe have survived and the axe has a brown patina. There are small areas of lighter green and eroded surfaces, around the mouth along the ribs, on one upper side, along the outer loop and along parts of the blade edge and break.



2. Croxton type socketed axe
Dimensions: length 108.8mm; blade width 46.5mm; width below loop 36.6mm; surviving external mouth dimensions (43.5mm) by (35.3mm); surviving internal mouth dimensions (32.7mm) by (26.6mm); depth of collar 14.2mm; depth of socket approx. 64.0mm; surviving weight 302.4g.

This is a near complete, slender socketed axe with approximately one third of the mouth missing. The sides have slightly concave curves, with slight widening and flaring at the blade end. The axe has a wide and flat onset collar, the collar slightly everted, but the mouth does not flare nor have a projecting or bulbous top. A narrow loop descends from the lower collar band. Three near parallel ribs descend from the underside of the collar, extending down approximately two thirds of the length of the faces. The face edges are sub-angular, however the faces and sides have marked convex curvature to them, giving an overall rounded effect to the axe, with its sub-oval cross-section. The mouth is narrow with oval shaped in both external shape and internal aperture and there is no evidence of runner stubs or scars. Casting seams are evident down both sides, but not prominent and there is suggestion that they have been rapidly hammered down. On one upper face and side, there are large rounded depressions in the surface crated by air bubbles during the casting process, however these are minor flaws and would not impact upon the use of the axe. On the blade facets, there are parallel striations running parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened in preparation for use. The break around the mouth and collar has a number of deep pits along it, suggesting that there may have been localised weakness here created by bubbling in the casting process. The original blade-edge is mostly present, with small nicks along its extent. The axe retains virtually all of its original surfaces and has a brown patina. On breaks and nicks, there are small areas of green and light green patina.



3. Croxton type socketed axe, with Yorkshire type affinities 
Dimensions: surviving length 79.0mm; surviving blade width 44.5mm; width below loop 33.7mm; external mouth dimensions 37.9 by 33.3mm; internal mouth dimensions 29.3 by 24.3mm; depth of collar 10.8mm; depth of socket approx. 65.0mm; surviving weight 203.4g.



This is a small and complete socketed axe with a rectangular-shaped cross-section, with straight and slightly divergent sides, expanding and recurving near the blade end. The axe has a wide and flat onset collar, the collar slightly everted, but the mouth does not flare nor have a projecting or bulbous top. A wide loop emerges from the underside of the collar. Three widely-spaced and slightly converging ribs descend from the collar, extending down approximately three-quarters of the length of the faces. The ribs are well-defined, the outer ones located close to the face edges, which are sub-angular. The upper origins of the ribs extend slightly into the lower collar. The casting seams are visible down each side but have been moderately worked down, either by file or hammer. The external mouth shape is sub-rectangular as is the internal aperture and the mouth is thin, with no evidence of runner stubs, or runner scars. On the upper blade bevels, there are linear striations running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating the axe was sharpened and prepared for use. There are areas of erosion and loss on one lower face, around the blade edge and in patches around the mouth and these areas have a green to light green patina. Overall, the original surfaces have a brown patina.



4. Plain socketed axe
Dimensions: length 78.0mm; surviving blade width 35.9mm; width below loop 28.8mm; external mouth dimensions 35.7 by 32.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 25.9 by 24.1mm; depth of socket approx. 63.0mm; surviving weight 107.3g.

This is a complete plain socketed axe of small size and slender proportions. The sides are slightly concave in shape, flaring outwards at the blade end. The mouth is flared, or slightly trumpet-shaped with slight bulbous thickening around the mouth. There is a wide and high-placed loop. The axe has a rectangular shaped body with sub-angular face edges. The mouth is sub-rectangular in both external shape and internal aperture and thin, with no evidence of runner-stubs or runner scars. The casting seams are visible and thin, but were carefully flattened either by filing or hammering. On the blade bevels, there are linear striations running parallel with the blade edge, indicating the axe was sharpened and prepared for use. Most original surfaces survive and have a brown patina, although small eroded green patches are visible around the mouth, on the loop, sides and along the eroded blade-edge.



5-6. Croxton type socketed axe & collar/upper face fragment 
Dimensions: length 133.9mm; surviving blade width 59.0mm; width below loop 44.8mm; surviving external mouth dimensions (46.1mm side to side); internal mouth dimensions (35.3mm side to side); depth of collar 18.8mm; depth of socket approx. 95.0mm; surviving weight main axe 382.4g; surviving combined weight of axe and fragment 391.5g.

Dimensions of small fragment: surviving length 37.1mm; surviving width approx. 26.5mm; surviving weight 9.1g.

This is a large socketed axe of slender proportions with approximately one-third of the mouth, collar and upper face missing. There is a small collar, upper face and side fragment, which probably broke off the main body of the axe during retrieval from the ground, but which conjoins and fits to the main axe. The axe has near straight but divergent sides, the loop side splaying and flaring differentially near the blade end, to give an unusual assymetric blade profile. The axe has a wide onset collar, with a slight concave curvature, to give a very slight flare of the mouth, but with no pronounced bulbous thickening around the mouth top. A low set loop descends from the underside of the collar. The sides of the axe are angled inwards from the central seams, rather than straight and the sub-angular face edges accentuate narrow faces and a concave flaring form. In cross-section, the axe is hexagonal in shape. The casting seams are visible, but were filed or hammered down. The mouth looks once to have been deep from front to back, to give a sub-square external shape and internal aperture, with rounded corners. The mouth top is thin with no evidence of runner-stubs or runner-scars. The blade is near straight, rather than curved. On the blade bevels there are linear striations running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating that the blade was sharpened for use. On the upper non-loop side, the axe has been damaged with a straight ended tool, which has removed an area of original surface and created a linear impact scar. At the margins, these damaged surfaces are light green, but near the impact mark, bronze metal has been exposed. A second dent and impact mark is evident on the broken face of the axe, which also removed two of the lower ribs. There are light green eroded patches on the blade sides, on one side and around the break edges. Cavities along the break edges and on one upper side suggest that air bubbles got into the axe as it was cast. Original surfaces have a brown patination, while one face has areas of a brown, compacted, soil/bronze concretion deposit still adhering to the surface.

The small collar, side and face fragment exhibits a wide onset collar of similar depth and profile to the main axe, with one upper rib and sub-angular face edge showing. The fragment has broken just beneath the mouth, so no original mouth top survives. This fragment has a brown patina over original surfaces, while the break edges are a green to light green colour. This fragment shows a reasonable fit with the main axe, indicating it is part of the same axe. On the main axe, newly exposed bronze metal can be seen where the fragment fits to the main body, providing evidence that the break occurred during recent retrieval of the axe, rather than in antiquity.



7. Probable South Wales type socketed axe 
Dimensions: surviving length 88.1mm; surviving blade width 44.8mm; width at point below loop 35.7mm; surviving external mouth dimensions - front to back 41.8mm; internal mouth dimensions - front to back 29.5mm; depth of socket approx. 63.0mm; surviving weight 182.9g.

This is a socketed axe of slender proportions, missing one-quarter of its mouth, loop and upper loop side. The sides are slightly divergent with slight expansion and recurving at the blade end. The axe has a prominent, somewhat bulbous and narrow mouth moulding with a poorly shaped but rounded mouth top. Descending from the mouth moulding on each face are three, near parallel, poorly aligned and executed ribs, which descend approximately three-quarters of the length of the axe faces. The axe has a rectangular cross-section and face edges are sub-angular but slightly rounded. The axe has a relatively deep front-back mouth, with sub-rectangular external shape and internal aperture with rounded corners. Around the mouth top, there are three rounded and poorly defined projections located at 90 degrees to each other. While the dimensions of these cannot be accurately measured, it indicates the existence of runner stubs, and suggests the axe was cast using a four-runner casting technology. The casting seams down each side are wide and visible, but have been hammered down after casting. The wall thickness in the area of the break is very thin, suggesting imperfections in the alignment of the moulds during casting, resulting in thinning and weaknesses here in the axe. This weakness appears to have led to a break here, whether in antiquity or the more recent past. On the surviving areas of blade bevels, linear striations can be seen running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating this axe was sharpened for use. On one face, recent linear scratches may be seen running between the ribs, suggesting recent damage, perhaps attempts to reveal the colour of the metal beneath. Original surfaces have a brown patination. The lower face surfaces are fragile and showing signs of lamination, revealing eroded sub-surfaces of brown and green colour. On one side, the mouth has been clipped probably during retrieval, revealing bronze metal and light green powdery surfaces. There are further light green powdery patches on the mouth, upper side and along the eroded blade edge.



8. South Wales Variant socketed axe 
Dimensions: combined surviving length 102.1mm; surviving blade width 51.1mm; width below loop 41.7mm; external mouth dimensions 49.0mm by (38.6mm); internal mouth dimensions - side to side 33.6mm (front to back not measurable); depth of mouth moulding/collar 11.8mm; depth of socket approx. 79.0mm; surviving weight 228.8g.

This is a ribbed socketed axe with a flaring blade, which is missing an area of one upper face and one-quarter of its mouth. The blade has also been broken across one corner. The axe has sides with concave curves, flaring outwards evenly towards the blade end. The axe has a deep and flat, but prominent everted mouth moulding / onset collar which is 11.8mm deep, and a relatively low set, but narrow loop, which emerges from the underside of this deep moulding or collar. Descending from the underside of this deep moulding, three near parallel and continuous ribs extend approximately two -thirds to three-quarters of the length of the faces. On one side, the ribs are slightly shorter, but parallel, while on the other, they are longer and curve to converge slightly towards the blade end. The flat-topped mouth has both sub-rectangular external shape and internal aperture and there is no evidence of runner-stubs or -scars around its top. The casting seams have been partially filed or hammered down. The break edges on the upper face of the axe show the wall to be very thin in this area, suggesting a casting flaw, leading to breakage here. As the break edges are fresh, the break appears to have happened recently during retrieval of the axe from the ground. On the blade bevels, linear striations can be seen running parallel with the blade-edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened after casting for use. The break to the blade corner is soil covered, suggesting the break occurred some time ago, rather than during recent retrieval from the ground. The faces of the axe are pitted with small eroded depressions, suggesting differential erosion while in the ground. The original surfaces have a brown patination. The upper break and blade-edge have lighter green eroded surfaces.



9-11. Llanarth type / Southern English B4 ribbed socketed axe
Dimensions: combined surviving length approx. 105.9mm; surviving length of large fragment 88.8mm; surviving blade width 42.2mm; width below loop 31.6mm; depth of socket approx. 73.0mm; combined surviving weight 155.4g; surviving weight of large fragment 140.1g.



Dimensions of mouth and moulding fragment: surviving length 23.9mm; surviving width 30.7mm; depth of double moulding 15.0mm; surviving weight 12.3g.

Dimensions of small moulding fragment: surviving length 25.5mm; surviving width 16.2mm; surviving weight 3.0g.



These are three conjoining fragments of a narrow and slender axe, which is missing three-quarters of its mouth, moulding and its loop. The sides are slightly divergent and with concave curves, flaring slightly at the blade end. The axe has a flaring and trumpet-shaped mouth with a concave form, the mouth slightly thickened, but not prominently bulbous or protruding. There is a lower ribbed moulding, however this double mouth moulding does not stand proud of the upper blade, so does not form a clear collar. The partial mouth fragment looks to have been possibly sub-oval in shape, although this cannot be established with certainty from the fragment remaining. No runner stubs or scars are evident on the surviving mouth top. The axe has a rectangular cross-section with angular to sub-angular face edges, although the faces have a slight convex curve to them, giving a slightly rounded face appearance. The casting seams are visible, but have been hammered or filed down. The breaks on all fragments look fresh, including some areas of exposed bronze metal, suggesting the axe was broken when it was removed from the ground and suggesting that fragments of the mouth remain in the find-spot locality. The surviving original surfaces of the axe have a brown patination, while areas along the breaks, around the mouth, on one upper face and along the blade-edge have light green and powdery eroded surfaces.



12. Ribbed socketed axe - small mouth fragment
Dimensions: surviving length 19.0mm; surviving width 36.5mm; surviving weight 8.0g.

This is a small mouth and upper face and side fragment of a socketed axe, the surviving mouth representing approximately one-quarter of the original complete mouth. The axe has a prominent and bulbous narrow mouth moulding with a rounded mouth top. Descending from this moulding a single rib is visible running down the upper face of the axe. The external shape and internal aperture of the axe appears to be sub-rectangular, with rounded edges. No runner-stubs or runner-scars are visible along the surviving mouth top. The break edges are fresh, suggesting that this axe was broken during its recent retrieval from the ground. As this fragment cannot be joined to any other of the axes, this must represent a ninth socketed axe, further fragments of which probably remain at the find-spot locality. The original surfaces of the axe have a brown patination, while areas of the break edge and upper face have light-green eroded surfaces.



Other Finds



A Roman bell-shaped stud, a modern socket or cap fragment containing wood remains and a copper lump were all reported with the hoard, but stylistic properties, complimented by metallurgical analysis, means they cannot be deemed associated with the find.","One of the socketed axes reported may be identified as a South Wales Type socketed axe (Nos. 1, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). A second axe (No. 7, above) was probably also an example of a South Wales type axe or Variant form, exhibiting some of the typological features: a four-runner casting technology, three ribbed decoration on both faces, descending from an out-splayed mouth and with a sub-rectangular cross-section. However, as the loop is missing, the characteristics of its form and relative loop location cannot be identified. In addition, this axe has a particularly deep front-back mouth dimension, suggesting an original sub-square shape, rather than the typical rectangular form, normally with a long axis from side to side. This deep mouth may suggest an axe that was cast, used and buried towards the end of the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 850-800 BC), since axes with deep front-back mouth dimensions generally become typical attributes of axe types used during the later Llyn Fawr phase of the Earliest Iron Age.



A further axe (No. 8, above) may be regarded as a Variant form of the South Wales type. Although of blocky rectangular form, with three ribs descending from a prominent mouth moulding similar to the South Wales type, this was not cast using the typical four-runner casting technology. In addition, this axe has a deep and everted mouth or collar with an even and flat profile, rather than the more typical prominent and out-splayed form. The loop, of modest width, is also lower set than typical on South Wales type socketed axes, the upper arm extending from beneath the deep mouth or collar. Overall however, it is most similar in form and proportions to socketed axes of the South Wales type, hence its attribution as a Variant example.



South Wales type socketed axes and their Variant forms are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, around forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. Approaching fifty single finds of South Wales Type socketed axes have also been discovered in south-east Wales. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



Two socketed axes (Nos. 2 & 5-6) may be identified as of Croxton type, with their deep onset collar bands, with flat or near flat profiles and face ribs descending from the underside of the collar-band. The type name Croxton originates from an example found in Cheshire, whilst the form appears to occur most commonly along The Marches (Northover, unpublished, 267). These axes typically belong to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC).



A further small socketed axe (No. 3, above) may be tentatively identified as a third example of a Croxton type socketed axe, but also showing affinities with Yorkshire type socketed axes. This example has a deep onset collar band, with a flat profile and giving the axe an evenly everted mouth. The three ribs on each face are extremely wide-set and extend down approximately two-thirds of the faces of the axe, converging very slightly near ends. These, together with the blocky and short proportions of the axe and wide loop, echo typical features of Yorkshire type axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223). However, this axe does not have a prominent and bulbous mouth moulding with a second lower positive moulding, as typical features of Yorkshire type axes and there are no opposed ribs evident inside the socket (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223-39, Cats. 1356-1571 & Pls. 89-99).



The slender ribbed socketed axe (Nos. 9-11, above) with a flaring and trumpet-shaped mouth of concave form, with a lower ribbed moulding and three short ribs down each face may be identified as of Llanarth type, equating with Class B4 Southern English ribbed axes and broadly with Type Welby ribbed axes of Northern England (Burgess 1963; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3, Cats. 1335-55, Pls. 88-9; Needham 1990, 36-7, Cat. 52 & Fig. 6.52; Northover, unpublished, 267). Llanarth type axes typically date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC) (Burgess 1963, 22; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 222-3; Needham 1990, 38; Northover unpublished, 267).



The small mouth fragment (No. 12, above) once belonged to a ribbed socketed axe, whose precise type cannot be established from the small fragment surviving. However, various forms of ribbed axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in around a dozen known hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales. Therefore, this presence is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard association from this region.



The small, plain and slender socketed axe (No. 4, above) is difficult to identify to a widespread type, although the absence of any mouth moulding or collar precludes many recognised types. In combination, the slender form with flaring mouth, sub-rectangular section and deep mouth plan, with slightly concave divergent sides and modest blade expansion, are most closely paralleled with Class 5 plain socketed axes from Ireland (Eogan 2000, 42-5, Cats. 201-25 & Pls. 11-12) or the miscellaneous slender socketed axes with rectangular bodies provisionally grouped together within Scotland and northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 217-8, Cats. 1295-1303, Pl. 86). They have been found associated within hoards of Ewart Park / Dowris date (1000-800 BC) in Britain and Ireland, although an earlier origin within the preceding Wilburton phase of the Late Bronze Age (1150-950 BC) is suspected but remains unproven (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 218; Eogan 2000, 45).



Having identified all nine socketed axes from this immediate localised find-spot, it is apparent that they all date to the same period of time: the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The account of the discovery of the axes indicates that all nine axes were found within approximately 1m of each other at depths of between 20 and 50cm beneath the surface. This is consistent with their burial together at the same time as a hoard within a pit feature.

858484,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"~~Item 1

Late Bronze Age socketed axe dating to 1100to 800 BC. The interior of the socket has a sub-square shape with rounded corners and measures 29x34 at the aperture. There is a small projection in the centre of each of the sides on the top edge of the socket, these are the filed down remains of the runner's and risers from the casting process. The edge of the aperture is surrounded by a thick tapering collar that has a semi-circular loop that projecting from one side in a low arch to join onto the side of the axe. On both faces are three long and pronounced straight ribs with tapering terminals that emanate from the base of the collar. The sides of the axe are very slightly bevelled with a very low central ridge on which is situated the casting seam. The edges expand outwards very slightly to the curved blade on the forward edge, which has a heavily corroded forward edge.

Length 115mm, width 69mm, thickness 45mm, weight 368g



Item 2

Late Bronze Age socketed axe dating to 1100to 800 BC. The interior of the socket has a sub-square shape with rounded corners and measures 31x25 at the aperture. There is a small projection in the centre of each of the sides on the top edge of the socket, these are the filed down remains of the runner's and risers from the casting process. The edge of the aperture is surrounded by a thick tapering collar that has a semi-circular loop that projecting from one side in a low arch to join onto the side of the axe. On both faces are three long and pronounced straight ribs with tapering terminals that emanate from the base of the collar. The sides of the axe are flat with a pronounced ridge running down the centre which is the remains of the casting seam. Towards the tip the side curve outwards to the curved blade on the forward edge, which has a heavily corroded forward edge. Deep striations run across the whole of the blade and maybe evidence of sharpening.

Length 90mm, width 53mm, thickness 41mm, weight 228g



Item 3

A fragment of a Late Bronze Age socketed axe that consists of the blade and the base of the socket. The break is ancient and irregular. The blade has a very low curved forward edge which is heavily corroded. Behind the blade the surface of the axe is in excellent condition with a dark green patina that has a series of shallow striation that run up from the blade on the top and bottom edge that are probably formed from use or sharpening. The casting seam is visible but has been filed down. The socket at the rear is oval 31mm long by 10mm wide and 9mm deep

Length 34mm, width 53mm, thickness 18mm, weight 87g



Item 4

A copper alloy socketed knife. The socket is oval in cross-section with an internal appetite of 18x10. The socket is sub-rectangular with slightly concave sides creating a narrowed waist. A single large rivet hole is situated towards the rear for attachment. The blade is 100mm long with slightly convex sides that narrow to a wide point at the tip. The face on both side of the blade is flat with long bevelled edges that form the cutting edge. The blade is snapped in two 1/3 up from the socket and although there is mud in the break, this section only show slight signs of corrosion with a bare metal evident over most of the exposed surface. Therefore, although this break is not recent it is still fairly modern meaning that this knife was complete when it was lost/buried and was broken post deposition.

858525,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard of two socketed axes and one spearhead.



1. South Wales type socketed axe



Dimensions: length (including runner stub) 101.8mm; length (excluding runner stub (99.6mm); blade width 45.3mm; width below loop 39.4mm; external mouth dimensions 49.6 by 47.5mm; internal mouth dimensions 31.0 by 30.3mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 8.6 by 3.4mm; height 0.3mm; (2) 9.9 by 3.9mm; height 1.2mm; (3) 8.8 by 4.0mm; height 2.2mm; (4) 8.2 by 4.6mm; height 0.1mm; depth of socket approx. 72.0mm; weight 370.8g.



This is a complete socketed axe of slender proportions, however with a blocky rectangular, tending towards square, shaped cross-section. The sides are slightly divergent and near straight, but with a very slight concave curve and there is virtually no expansion at the blade end. The axe has a prominent out-splayed mouth moulding with a narrow loop descending from its underside. Three near parallel ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending a little over half way down each face. These ribs are prominent, but discontinuous towards the base on one face, suggesting imperfections in flow and casting, or a mould-half which was old when used. The axe has a near square body cross-section with extremely angular and crisp face-edges. The axe has a deep front-back mouth, almost square, and the mouth top is heavy and wide. The external shape and internal aperture of the mouth are virtually sub-square with rounded corners. Four projecting runner-stubs, two very prominent and untrimmed, are present around the mouth, each 90 degrees apart, indicating the use of a four-runner casting technology. The casting seams down each side are sharp and prominent and were never hammered or filed down after casting. The faces of the axe, have very slight and indistinct, rounded and shallow hollows across them and down to near the blade edge, indicating that this axe retained the contours of its mould and was never hammered or worked up for use. On one lower central face, there is a larger circular depression with rougher surfaces. This is not an impact scar and appears to be a minor casting flaw or imperfection in the mould. There are linear striations visible on the non-worked or hammered blade margins, running parallel with the blade edge. This suggests cursory preparation of the axe, which was never used as a tool before it was buried. The original surfaces of the axe have survived exceptionally well and have a brown patination. Small patches of eroded surface are evident on the sides, around the mouth and on the blade edge, and these have a grey-green patina.



2. Yorkshire type socketed axe



Dimensions: length 69.6mm; blade width 40.2mm; width below loop 27.8mm; external mouth dimensions 32.6 by 30.7mm; internal mouth dimensions 23.1 by 23.0mm; depth of socket approx. 53.0mm; weight 97.9g.



This is a small and complete socketed axe with a flared blade. The sides of the axe are divergent and with concave curved form, expanding more markedly near the blade edge. The axe has a double mouth moulding with a flared trumpet form and thickened mouth top. On each face, three wide-spaced, well-defined and short ribs descend from the lower mouth moulding. The ribs are slightly divergent and extend less than one third of the length of each face. A wide loop emerges from the lower mouth moulding. The axe has a sub-rectangular cross section and the face edges are rounded, while the mouth is deep and square with rounded corners. On the inner mouth is a narrow line of projecting excess metal from the casting, though the edges are rounded, possibly rapidly hammered or filed down. Casting seams are narrow but prominent down each side, with little effort to hammer or file these down. In side view, it is apparent that one mould-half was deeper than the other, as the casting seam is off the centre line. One upper face has a shallow depression across its surface, suggesting a slight imperfection in the shaping of the mould. Along the blade bevels there are surface striations running parallel with the blade edge, while slightly higher up the blade faces are striations running at ninety degrees to the axis of the blade edge. These suggest the axe was prepared for use. Original surfaces are well preserved on this axe, with a brown patination. There are small patches and pits of eroded surface on the lower faces and along the blade edge, which have a green patina.



3. Plain Pegged Spearhead, with lanceolate leaf-shaped blade



Dimensions: surviving length 104.3mm; surviving length of blade approx. 87.0mm; surviving maximum blade width 44.6mm; external diameter of socket at break (side to side) 25.8mm; surviving length of socket below blade 14.8mm; distance peg-hole below blade approx. 11.5mm; surviving depth of socket approx.73.0mm; surviving weight 49.9g.



A Plain Pegged spearhead with a lanceolate leaf-shaped blade, broken across the socket near the line of the peg-hole. The midrib has a slight rounded ridge along its central length on both faces, giving its cross-section a sub-lozengic shape at the break. The midrib tapers slightly near the lower blade, giving slightly concave edges. The blade edges are eroded and no blade bevels can now be seen. The blade surfaces have many longitudinal striations parallel with the line of the midrib, suggesting the blade was prepared and sharpened in prehistory. Three-quarters of the break edges on the socket are soil covered, suggesting a break in antiquity, however there is also a fresh break on one side where the wall is thinnest, indicating a recent break during retrieval of the artefact from the ground. On each side at the break, the upper sides of the peg-holes are visible, suggesting they once had a diameter of 4-5mm. In side view, the blade is slightly bent, hinting that the spear may either have been damaged in use or forcibly bent and perhaps broken, before burial. On one upper midrib face, there is a corroded hole through the wall into the socket interior, where the midrib wall was particularly thin. Original surfaces have a brown patina. The tip, blade edges and part of the socket break have green corroded surfaces, as does the corroded hole in the upper midrib wall.","One of the two socketed axes reported may be identified as a South Wales type socketed axe (No. 1, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and narrow loop, blocky rectangular form, four-runner casting technology, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). This axe has a particularly deep front-back mouth dimension, tending towards a sub-square shape, rather than typical rectangular form, normally with a long-axis from side to side. This deep mouth and long slender form may suggest an axe that was cast, used and buried towards the end of the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 850-800 BC), since axes with deep front-back mouth dimensions generally become typical attributes of axe types used during the late Ewart Park and Llyn Fawr phases of the Late Bronze and Earliest Iron Ages.



South Wales type socketed axes are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, around forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. Approaching fifty single finds of South Wales Type socketed axes have also been discovered in south-east Wales. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).



The second socketed axe (No. 2, above) in this hoard group may be identified as of probable Yorkshire type. This axe has widely spaced, short and divergent ribs descending from a mouth moulding, with a prominent and everted collar. In addition a wide loop emerges from the lower mouth moulding. The axe is sub-rectangular in cross-section and the mouth and socket plan is deep and square. All of these features are diagnostic of the Yorkshire type (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223). This is a small and slender example of the type, with a flared blade, however can be paralleled within the range of known examples of the type (e.g. Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 224, 227, 229-30, 234-5; Cats. 1368, 1404, 1438, 1448, 1517, 1543, Pls. 89, 91, 93, 97 & 98).



Yorkshire type axes are most commonly found in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, though there is a scatter known in East Anglia and Scotland (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 223). These axes are found in hoards dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, most commonly in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire East Anglia and Borders, but with occasional examples also known in Carp's Tongue hoards across southern England of Ewart Park date (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 237-8). One possible Yorkshire type axe has been identified within the Stogursey, Somerset hoard (McNeil 1973, 49 & 56, Cat. 17 & Fig. 3; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 238), while one socketed axe in the second Llantilio Crossenny hoard in the same field shows affinities with the Yorkshire type (Gwilt et al 2016a).



The spearhead (No. 3, above) may be identified as a Plain Pegged Spearhead with a lanceolate, leaf-shaped blade. Pegged spearheads, as an artefact class, generally span from the second half of the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) (e.g. Greenwell and Brewis 1909, 463; Ehrenberg 1977, 3, 13-14 & Fig. 1; O'Connor 1980, 100-101, 138-41; Northover unpublished, 271, 283). In Wales, early examples of Plain Pegged socketed spearheads are found in the Penard (Swansea), Guilsfield (Powys) and Princetown (Blaenau Gwent) hoards, the first dating to 1300-1150 BC and the second and third dating to 1020-920 BC (Barnwell 1864; Savory 1965; 1972; 1980, 117-19, Cats. 266, 268 & 272; Figs. 32-8 & 40). However, they become most common as associations within hoards of Ewart Park date, dating to 1000-800 BC. The wooden hafts of a number of Plain Pegged spearheads in England have also been radiocarbon dated to the Ewart Park period of the Late Bronze Age dating to between 1000 BC and 800 BC (Needham 1996, 136-7 & Fig. 3; Needham et al 1997, 93-8).



Having identified the three artefacts discovered at this localised find-spot and in close association, it is apparent that they all typically date to the same period of time: the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). The account of the discovery of the axes indicates that these artefacts were all discovered in the same metal-detector pit, but at varying depths of 15-17cm, 30cm and 45cm beneath the surface. This account of discovery is consistent with the burial of these artefacts at the same time and within the same pit feature dug into the sub-soil layer during the Late Bronze Age.

858576,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-800,"Description: Incomplete gold strip of uncertain date (see discussion). Broadly rectangular with one complete end which exhibits a circular perforation. The strip is bent at a sharp angle and has a number of dents, terminating in a jagged break. There are extensive scratch marks, probably from post-depositional damage. 



Dimensions: Length (bent): 37mm. Approximate full length: c. 59mm. Width: 9mm. Thickness: 1mm. Weight: 3.9g. 



Discussion: The strip was found in an unstratified context during metal detecting. It has no decorative or other diagnostic features, and thus it is difficult to assign a date. Gold strips with perforations at one or both ends first appear in the Bronze Age (e.g. BH-1BE953 / 2014 T901, DOR-173265 / 2006 T380, CORN-8EC344 / 2014 T39). Although some others (e.g. NCL-59F7F8) have been considered undiagnostic and not provably over 300 years old, the balance of probabilities suggests that this example may well be of Bronze Age date.

Description: The fragment represents part of the socketed end of the axe and is unevenly shaped. Part of the rimmed collar for the socket remains. Just after the rim there is a side loop to help secure the axe to its handle. There is substantial casting line running from the rim and along the mid-line of the loop onto the body of the axe. It appears this casting feature has had very limited finishing. The fragment is dark green on the surfaces and a light green on the breaks which may suggest the axe was broken while in the ground but a substantial time after its deposition.

859258,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Late Bronze Age hoard comprising five socketed axes and one axe fragment.



1. South Wales type socketed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 101.5mm; surviving blade width 51.1mm; width below loop 42.9mm; external mouth dimensions 51.0 by 41.9mm; internal mouth dimensions 33.0 by 27.1mm; dimensions of runner stubs 8.6 by 4.5mm; height 1.0mm; (2) 8.2 by 4.9mm; height 0.5mm; (3) 7.5 by 3.7mm; height 0.5mm; (4) 9.0 by 3.5mm; height 0.2mm; depth of socket approx. 83.0mm; surviving weight 278.7g.



A near complete socketed axe with a broken loop, of blocky rectangular form, with straight and slightly divergent sides and little expansion and recurving visible towards the blade end. The axe has a prominent but narrow mouth moulding, with a high and narrow loop descending from the underside. Three well-defined and parallel ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending down approximately three-quarters of the blade. The axe is rectangular in section with angular face edges. The casting seams are visible down each side, but have been hammered or filed down with reasonable care, although the flash within the loop is slightly more prominent and less worked down. The mouth is sub-rectangular in shape and internal aperture. Four runner stubs are evident around the mouth, indicating a four-runner casting technology. The axe has a brown patina and most original surfaces survive. The blade edge is highly damaged, revealing lighter green surfaces. There are small areas of eroded lighter green surfaces along the face edges and around the mouth.



2. South Wales type socketed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 101.1mm; surviving blade width 55.4mm; width below loop 40.9mm; external mouth dimensions 51.2mm by 40.6mm; internal mouth dimensions 34.3mm by 28.6mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 11.3 by 5.4mm; height 1.5mm; (2) 11.4 by 5.0mm; height 1.0mm; (3) 10.7 by 4.6mm; height 0.5mm; (4) 10.6 by 4.4mm; height 0.5mm; depth of socket approx. 76.0mm; surviving weight 274.7g.

This is a complete socketed axe with slightly concave and divergent sides, with significant expansion and recurving at the blade end. The axe has a prominent and slightly bulbous mouth moulding, with a high placed and relatively wide loop descending from its underside. Three well-defined and convergent ribs descend from the moulding on each face, extending down approximately two-thirds of the length of the faces. On one face, the outer rib, furthest from the loop side is more markedly angled and convergent, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of this mould piece. The axe is rectangular in cross-section with angled face edges. The casting seams down each side are prominent, but have been hammered to remove sharp edges. The mouth is sub-oval in external shape, with a sub-rectangular shaped internal aperture, with rounded corners. Four runner stubs are evident around the mouth, indicating a four-runner casting technology. One upper face has a shallow depressed area, suggesting an irregularity in the shaping of the mould-piece used for casting the axe. Along the blade bevel, the presence of linear surface striations parallel with the axis of the blade indicate that the blade of the axes was prepared and sharpened. The axe has a grey-green patina over most surfaces. On the upper faces, there are patches of black patination, suggesting that the axe may have been deliberately coloured through a patination process, after casting. The blade edge is heavily worn, with light green and fragile powdery surfaces.
3. South Wales Variant type socketed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 115.7mm; surviving blade width 55.3mm; width below loop 45.8mm; surviving external mouth dimensions (45.4mm) by 48.1mm; surviving internal mouth dimensions (37.3mm) by 32.7mm; dimensions of runner stubs (1) 7.6 by 3.3mm; height approx. 0.2mm; (2) 7.5 by 3.7mm; height approx. 0.2mm; depth of socket approx. 73.0mm.; surviving weight 376.7g.

This is a near complete socketed axe with a damaged mouth. This is a large socketed axe with an angular hexagonal cross-section, with slightly divergent and concave shaped sides. The axe has a prominent but narrow mouth moulding, with a high placed and narrow loop descending from its underside. Three very prominent and wide ribs descend from the moulding on each face and are convergent. Unusually, the central rib is significantly longer than the two lateral ribs, the former extending down three-quarters of the length of the face and the latter only extending half the length of the blade. The face edges are angled and significantly narrower than the sides and the edges have been deliberately raised, giving the overall effect similar to a faceted axe. The axe has a deep front back mouth axis, the mouth being square in external outline and with a sub-rectangular internal aperture, with curved edges. One half of the mouth top has been broken, the break looking fresh in places, suggesting breakage during removal from the ground. Two runner-stubs are visible around the mouth, located at 180 degrees to each other, but there is insufficient of the mouth surviving to tell whether or not there were originally four runners. The sides of the axe are significantly angled, coming to their widest point at the central casting seam. While the join is prominent and angled, there is little excess and it appears that the flashes may have been hammered flat in places. There are linear striations along the blade facets and parallel with the blade edge, indicating that the axe was sharpened for use. Most of the original surfaces have survived and the axe has a grey-green patina. The mouth edges and blade edge are eroded, with light green and fragile powdery surfaces. There are also small patches of eroded lighter green surface on the faces and external loop edge. The casting seams down the sides of the axe are visible, but were hammered or filed down carefully after casting.
4. Class B - Southern English ribbed axe
Dimensions: surviving length 72.1mm; surviving blade width 39.3mm; width below loop 30.6mm; external mouth dimensions 34.0mm by 32.9mm; internal mouth dimensions 26.4 by 25.2mm; depth of socket approx. 61.0mm; surviving weight 101.7g.

This is a complete small ribbed axe, with divergent and concave shaped sides, expanding towards the blade end. The axe has a flared trumpet shaped mouth, but with no evidence of a collar or collar-moulding. Five parallel ribs descend from the under-side of the flaring mouth, extending for a little under half of the total length of the axe face. The two outer ribs define the face edges of the axe. The axe has a rectangular shaped cross-section and the face edges are sub-angular. The loop is low-set, its upper arm descending some distance below the upper origin of the face ribs. The axe has a deep front back mouth axis, being sub-square in both external shape and internal aperture, with curved edges. No runner-stubs or scars are evident around the mouth. On one blade bevel, the remains of striations running parallel with the blade edge are visible, indicating that the axe was sharpened as preparation for use. One face of the axe has been heavily brushed, probably by the finder after discovery of the axe, as indicated by deep striations and the loss of original surfaces on one face. On the reverse and better preserved face, and on the loop side, patches of black patina are evident, suggesting the axe was deliberately coloured black after casting. The axe has an overall light green patina with fragile and powdery surfaces. The blade edge is heavily eroded and fragile, while the top of the mouth is also lighter green and powdery.
5. Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth / Class D
Dimensions: surviving length 117.2mm; surviving blade width 43.1mm; width below loop 27.1mm; surviving external mouth dimensions 27.1mm (front to back); surviving internal mouth dimensions 23.2mm (front to back); max. collar width 28.5mm; depth of socket approx. 85.0mm.; surviving weight 148.0g.

This is a near complete, slender and faceted axe, with damaged mouth, missing loop and broken blade edge. The sides are divergent and with a concave curve, widening at the blade end. The axe has a flared or trumpet-shaped mouth, with a wide collar and a low-set and narrow loop, emerging below the collar. The collar is unusually wide with a convex, evenly curved and wide mid zone moulding defined to either side by evenly curved depressions running parallel with the central moulding. The collar is onset, with a step down to the top of the blade faces, but with a raised, flat-topped and wide moulding (2.5mm) defining the lower collar margin. The facets are narrow and the edges are sub-angular, the axe having a total of eight facets (three on each face and one on each side). The side casting seams are visible, however were hammered or filed, except beneath the loop, where a projecting flash is still visible. Approximately half of the mouth of the axe is missing and the break appears eroded, rather than new. The external outline and internal aperture of the mouth are oval in shape. Running down the upper face on one side, linear striations are evident, running parallel with the long axis of the axe. These appear to have been created in antiquity, since they are within the patinated surface. On the upper blade bevel, there are linear striations running parallel with the original blade edge, indicating the axe blade was sharpened ready for use. Most original surfaces of the axe survive and the artefact has a grey-green patina. The blade edge has mostly been removed through breakage. On one corner, the break looks new, exposing core metal, while much of the length of the broken blade has light green and powdery surfaces. One area of lower blade and side is also eroded with similar light green and powdery surfaces, while the loop breaks and parts of the mouth and mouth breaks are also light green and powdery. Within the socket, there are two projecting lumps of green carbonate concretion, about one third of the way down the inner socket wall.
6. Mouth fragment of slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth / Class D
Dimensions: maximum surviving length 41.6mm; collar width 11.0mm; surviving weight 15.9g.

This is a small mouth side fragment of a slender faceted axe, with two broken loop stubs evident. The axe had a modestly flaring mouth, with a medium depth onset collar. It is not clear whether the lower collar margin had a projecting collar moulding, or whether the collar was a simple band, with a concave profile and a step margin onto the upper faces. The narrow loop projected from the underside of the collar. Down the side, a casting seam is visible and appears not to have been trimmed or hammered across the collar. On one side, a narrow facet can be seen extending from the collar down the upper face of the axe and it is likely that this axe once had eight facets (three on each face, with one on each side). On the exterior surface, there are patches of black patination on the collar and within the loop and the interior socket surface is markedly blackened. The rest of the exterior surface has a grey-green patina, with small arear of light green and powdery surface visible on the loop stubs, on the mouth top and in places along the breaks.","Three of the socketed axes reported may be identified as South Wales Type socketed axes or Variant forms (Nos. 1-3, above). The combination of out-splayed mouth, high placed and ephemeral loop, blocky rectangular form, ribs descending from the underside of the collar and poorly finished state following casting are all diagnostic elements, in combination helping to identify it to this type (e.g. Needham 1981, 31; Northover unpublished, 259-60; Burgess 2012, 239 & Fig. 1). These socketed axes and their Variant forms a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, around forty hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. Approaching fifty single finds of South Wales Type socketed axes have also been discovered in south-east Wales. They are also frequent smaller presences in contemporary hoards across mid and north-east Wales, south western and England, southern England and northern France, with occasional outliers in northern Britain and Ireland (McNeil 1973, 61-4; Moore 1978; Needham 1981, 55-66; Burgess 2012, 241-4 & Fig. 2).

One axe (No. 4, above), may be identified as a Class B - Southern English ribbed axe of a sub-type most resembling Class B2, with five-ribs and a trumpet-shaped mouth (Needham 1990, 32-5 & Fig. 5). These broadly equate with Type Welby ribbed axes of Northern England (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 221-3, Cats. 1335-55, Pls. 88-9). The apparent absence of a collar or positive moulding on this axe is a variation on the more typical traits of the type and this example is at the smallest end of the known range. Various forms of ribbed axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in around a dozen known hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales.

Two slender faceted axes (Nos. 5 & 6, above) may be identified as of Type Meldreth or Class D faceted axes, which have a variety of sub-types, dependent upon the shape and depth of their collar and mouth shape (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 204-11; Needham 1990, 41-3; Gwilt et al 2005, 37-8). This type is generally regarded as of British type, although they do occur in Ireland and France (O' Connor 1980, 166-7; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 53-62, Cats. 296-392). Nearly all of the known hoard associations containing these axes are securely of Late Bronze Age date and belonging to the Ewart Park phase between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61), although a few examples have been found in slightly earlier Late Bronze Age hoards dating to 1150-1000 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 210-1; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2001, 61).

Having identified all six socketed axes reported from this immediate localised find-spot, it is apparent that all are securely of Ewart Park date of manufacture, dating to between 1000-800 BC. The account of discovery strongly suggests that the hoard group had remained buried together until the recent past in small pit feature cutting into a protected soil beneath a Medieval to post-Medieval field bank and hedge-line. In recent years, the farmer created a new entrance across this field boundary, by digging out and flattening the boundary in this localised area. This event disturbed the ancient soil beneath the bank, causing the artefacts in the hoard to be scattered over an area of 4m, to either side of the new entrance. Their reported depths of 15-25cm are consistent with having been moved within bank material and redeposited and compacted at moderate depth within the soil levelling activity.

859261,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-900,"A complete cast copper alloy socketed spearhead dating from the Middle to Late Bronze Age c.1400-900 BC. The spearhead has a slender, tapering leaf-shaped (ogival) blade with slightly bevelled edges and two undrilled lozenge-shaped side 'loops' located near to the mouth of the socket, which is circular in plan and tapers internally. The spearhead is in good condition with some bronze disease and corrosion evident.



The loops may have been miscast as they are solid rather than having on internal eye. Spearheads with similar miscastings have been found locally; one from the same parish as this new example, now in the Ashmolean Museum (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706), another from Standlake (Ash.M. 1911.137) and a third recently recorded only c. 1 kilometre from this new example (BERK-5BCE29 on this database). Ehrenberg (1977:7) suggests that such miscast examples or those with unmade loops may indicate that the shaft of the spear was simply wedged in to the socket and not secured by strings. The shape of the blade may be the result of resharpening (Ibid; after Davey 1973:79).



The internal diameter of the socket is 13.65mm.

859294,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2050,"Early Bronze Age hoard comprising one flat axe and one axe-chisel.



1. Flat axe - Type Barton Stacey (Class 3D)



Dimensions: maximum length 156.0mm; width of butt 34.2mm; blade width 98.1mm; maximum thickness 9.2mm; weight 475.2g.



This is a complete flat axe in good condition, with original surfaces surviving over the majority of the axe. The axe is narrow-butted and wide-bladed and has a lenticular profile. The sides of the axe are gently concave, expanding modestly from the butt to the blade end. There is slight triple faceting visible down the sides of the axe, indicating that these were hammered after casting. Hammering of the side facets has led to the face-edges becoming crisp and very slightly raised in places, however this is not deliberate and visible enough to constitute true low hammered flanges. The butt of the axe is curved with a low to medium arch. There is no central stop bevel on the faces of the axe. The broad cutting edge has a shallow blade bevel, approximately 7mm in depth. Striations are evident on the lower face and blade bevel, running parallel with the long-axis of the axe, indicating the blade was prepared for use. There is differential patination evident on the axe, one face being green and the other being dark-grey green. Along one side of the dark-grey green face, there is an elongate strip of mottled surface matching the size and dimensions of the axe-chisel. This provides evidence that the axe and axe-chisel were carefully placed together, one immediately on top of the other. A localised area of black patination extends across half of the blade bevel on the reverse axe face with green patination. On the butt end of the face with green patination, a modern diagonal scrape is also evident, revealing a small area of fresh bronze metal. A second less deep diagonal scratch is also evident on the same face at the lower blade end. This is likely to have occurred during recent removal of the axe from the ground by the finder. In places along the face-edges and blade-edge original surfaces have been lost, revealing grey-green areas of sub-surface. In places along face-edges, there is also localised surface cracking evident on original surfaces, indicating these areas to be fragile and unstable.



2. Axe-chisel (Class 3)



Dimensions: maximum length 110.6mm; width of butt 14.8mm; blade width 44.6mm; maximum thickness 6.1mm; weight 84.4g.



This is a complete slender axe-chisel in good condition, with original surfaces surviving over the majority of the artefact. The axe-chisel is narrow butted and lenticular in profile. The sides of the axe-chisel are gently concave, expanding modestly from the butt to the blade end. The butt of the axe-chisel is curved with a low arch. There is no central stop bevel on the axe-chisel faces. On the lower face, near the blade edge surface striations are evident, generally aligned parallel with the artefact long axis and suggesting it was prepared for use. The axe-chisel has a mottled and variable coloured patina, ranging from green, grey-green to green-brown. One face has appreciable surface concretions, which are black and brown in colour and this would appear to have been the surface which was laid directly against the flat axe (above). Along one upper side towards the butt end, there is a linear groove or scratch, which has exposed fresh bronze metal and this appears to be recent. There is a circular scar on one upper face, near the face-edge, which appears to have been created by being recently knocked, to remove an area of fragile original surface. Near the butt end and at the blade margins, there are small areas where original surfaces have been lost, revealing grey green areas of powdery sub-surface.","The flat axe (No. 1, above) may be identified as a Class 3 flat axe, of the 3D sub-class named Type Barton Stacey. This identification is based upon a combination of stylistic and technological features and metrical measurements and ratios, as defined and developed by Needham in relation to the Early Bronze Age axes of central and southern England (Needham 1983; forthcoming). As such, this may be correlated with the Brithdir Assemblage (Period 2; Metalwork Assemblage III) at the very beginning of bronze casting in Britain around 2200/2150-2050 BC (e.g. Needham 1985, iii; 1996, 127-30; forthcoming; Needham et al 2015, 35-6; Rohl & Needham 1998,

88-9). These forms of flat axe are fairly well represented in Wales and The Marches.



The second smaller artefact (No. 2, above), may be identified as a Class 3 axe-chisel, based upon its stylistic and technological features, size and proportions. Class 3 axes and axe-chisels are diagnostic of the Brithdir and Mile Cross Assemblages (Period 2/ earlier Period 3; Metalwork Assemblages III & IV) in Britain between around 2200/2150-1950 BC (e.g. Needham 1985, iii; 1996, 127-32; forthcoming; Rohl & Needham 1998, 88-90). However, the features and proportions evident on this example are similar to those witnessed on the associated flat axe. This strongly supports the notion that this axe-chisel may also be dated to the Brithdir Assemblage (Period 2; Metalwork Assemblage III) and dating to around 2200/2150-2050 BC.



Class 3 axe-chisels are less common than Class 3 axes, though their frequency has been increasing in recent years through metal detected finds reported via the Portable Antiquities Scheme.



The finder's account of the discovery, a preliminary archaeological investigation of the find-spot of the hoard and careful observation of the two artefacts have provided important information about the manner of their burial in the ground. The finder reported the two artefacts were found lying flat, with the axe-chisel lying on the flat axe at a depth of approximately 30cm beneath the surface and beneath a large flat stone. It is highly probable that these two bronze artefacts were carefully placed together within a small pit, dug during the Early Bronze Age, which was quickly infilled and covered and concealed with a large limestone capping stone.



Metallurgical analysis of the flat axe and axe-chisel has confirmed that both artefacts are made of a tin bronze, with significant presence of arsenic as an impurity. This alloy composition adds weight to their dating attribution to the Brithdir Assemblage at the very beginning of bronze casting in Britain (ca. 2200/2150-2050 BC). Lead isotope analyses of other contemporary bronze flat axes from Britain have strengthened the evidence for a continuing use of arsenical copper sources within flat axes of this earliest bronze tradition (Rohl & Needham 1998, 88-9, Plots 26A & B) and the arsenical presence detected in this flat axe and axe-chisel is consistent with this picture. Analysis has also confirmed that both artefacts had extremely similar alloy signatures and were cast from the same metal alloy composition. This provides an additional strand of evidence in support of the contemporaneity of these two artefacts.

859308,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1400,"A complete copper alloy palstave axe dating to the early Middle Bronze Age. The palstave is complete and in good condition. The crescentic blade is wide and has a bevelled edge, clearer on one side than the other. The stop ridge between the raised low-flanged edges is likewise more prominent on one side than the other. There are no side loops nor a midrib down the centre of the blade.The lack of a side loop and lack of any ribs suggest this palstave may be relatively early and is probably of the Acton Park II period, c.1500-1400 BC.","
The palstave has an odd blue staining on one side - this may be a chemical reaction with contaminants from agricultural activities.

The item is fragmentary and only the curved blade edge of the axe remains. This makes it difficult to identify and date precisely, though it is likely, due to the metal composition and form, that the fragment is Bronze Age in date, c. 2350 - 800BC.



The blade tip is lentoid in cross section, with the edges being the thinnest point (1.1mm), and the thickness gradually tapering toward the centre and away from the edge.

Bronze Age copper-alloy fragmentary metal work hoard which had been stored in a ceramic vessel that had later been hit by a plough/farm machinery and partially scattered a small distance around the location of the vessel. Some fragments of metal were still within the cracked vessel while others had dispersed slightly.



61 sherds of ceramic vessel (possibly Deverel Rimbury ware). 21 of these sherds are extremely small fragments. At least two of the larger sherds cross-fit.





8 fragments (of possible scabbard chape) with more than two sides.

40 fragments of probable scabbard chape with two sides present (one with an interesting square notch at break), 10 of which seem to have shaped top edges.

102 fragments of single side of probable scabbard chape (very thin sheet metal most but not all have at least one rib). One not photographed with the others.

8 fragments that seem to be from a hollow artefact more solid than a scabbard chape. One has a circular notch at the break.

21 fragments which have one or more rib on one surface and are fairly chunky/solid and relatively flat.

8 fragments that have diagnostic features.

143 fragments that are fairly solid and flat, almost none have any rib. 7 of which have incomplete notches on the break which may aid identification.

9 other metal fragments. Mostly set molten drips or blobs, one piece that seems to be a circular cross-sectioned short length of wire. One looks more like a small dusty sherd of ceramic vessel but has a more metallic weight to it.

2 fragments of cu. One is sheet metal with three sides, possibly scabbard chape. Another solid piece of metal is stuck within this three sided sheet metal. It is currently uncertain whether this is the remains of a blade within its chape or unrelated material lodged together.

Part of the socket has been broken off and the tip pf the spearhead is missing. The blades are short and leaf-shaped. The hollow of the socket extends 46 mm into the the spear. It is circular and tapers towards the tip, becoming lozengiform in cross section as it develops into the solid mid-rib between the blades. There are two small, oval, pierced side loops set opposite each other part way along the socket. There are traces of casting lines along the sides of the spearhead running from above the side loops to the base of the blades. Below the side loops, the casting lines appear to have been smoothed away.

Dot Boughton suggests LANCUM-7609C0 on the PAS database as a parrallel in which record she notes ""Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal.

859659,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1250,"A cast copper alloy slender un-looped Middle Bronze Age palstave, probably from the Taunton metalwork phase and dating from c. 1500- 1300 BC. The cutting edge has a pronounced crescentic form with the tips re-curving back onto the expanding form of the blade body. The body has a well-defined stop ridge just short of midway down its length and the flanges extend and taper, down to the blade section. There are clear casting lines down each side of the axe, there are no other design elements to be seen.



The blade appears to have been lightly used with a few small indentations and modest striations over its surface. However, it can't be ruled out that the markings are from its time and movement in the ground. The surface looks to have been 'treated' in some way with the resultant loss of the original patination - the finder reports that this palstave was found during works on a medieval moated site in the 1980s, and appears to have come from the dredge of the moat. This may explain the surface appearance of the axe. This palstave is unusual in the inclusion of flange extensions on the side of the blade but without a central midrib. Rowlands (1976: plate 26, nos. 252, 189, 238) illustrates three similar examples which he define as his type 2 (side flanged) form dating to c. 1500-1150 cal BC. There are no good parallels illustrated by Schmidt and Burgess (1981) although the form most closely corresponds to their Group 2 (early Mid ribbed) due to the flange extensions. They suggest this form is one of the earlier tpyes dating to the Acton Park to Taunton Phase of the bronze Age c.1500-1250 cal BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,477.4,,,29.4,70.1,1,Rod Trevaskus,Rod Trevaskus,South East,Oxfordshire,South Oxfordshire,Lewknor,SU7097,From finder,51.66742567,-0.98924246,BERK-41E4C6,,BERK41E4C6.jpg,Palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BERK41E4C6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/624769.jpg

860042,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete middle Bronze Age copper alloy palstave, probably dating to c. 1500-1300 BC. The palstave is 148.8mm long, with the stop ridge being 62.1mm from the butt. Both the butt end and septum are rectangular, the latter being 10.8mm deep at the stop ridge, which is angled, sloping inwards. The flanges, 3.1mm thick, are lozenge-shaped when viewed in profile, reaching a maximum width of 34.1mm, expanding from 27.8mm at the stop ridge. In plan, the palstave is measures 16.6mm wide at the butt, expanding immediately below it to reach a maximum of 22.6mm roughly in line with the beginning of the flanges. The width then remains largely consistent, being 21.2mm at the stop ridge, below which point the blade begins to flare outwards in a gradual curve, reaching 58.7mm wide at the cutting edge, which is crescentic, with unflaired tips. In profile the blade is broadly triangular, narrowing immediately below the stop ridge in a curved line to 17.4mm, from which point the narrowing is more gradual, tapering to a point at the cutting edge. The blade is unflanged.



The palstave is looped, the inclusion of which takes the maximum width to 29.3mm, the lower edge of the loop is in line with the stop ridge, and it is 20.8mm long and 9.1mm wide (when the palstave is viewed in profile). Both sides of the palstave have longitudinal casting seams, relatively unpronounced. Both faces of the blade feature trident decoration immedieately below the stop ridge, this being a short central mid-rid contained within a shield shaped depression, itself defined by slightly raised ridges.



Overall dimensions: length 148.8mm; width 58.7mm; thickness 34.1mm; weight 333g.



A Palstave featuring very similar ""trident"" decoration can be seen illustrated by Pearce (1984, no. 809), described as being of high-flanged South-Western type. Another comparable palstave, although with lower flanges is published by Knight, Omrod & Pearce (2015, no. 460), from a small hoard in Somerset. Comparable palstaves on this database include LVPL-135122 and WAW-B8887E.

860485,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1725,-1500,"A complete copper alloy Early Bronze Age flanged axehead.



This axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, but not recurving. Cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a very shallow lenticular side profile. The flanges are slightly triple-faceted, so are slightly angled inwards on both faces and on one side very faint traces of decoration can be observed when lit correctly along the central, flat facet; this decoration appears to be hammered, angled corded decoration.



The axe has a curved bevel or ridge about halfway down the septum (c.53.5mm from the butt), which is marginally lower than the flanges, but indicates the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion, though this is clearer on the better preserved face and a shallow groove can be observed, emphasising this ridge. The cutting edge is quite deep (26mm) and has an even crescentic cutting edge, though this has slightly abraded as a result of corrosion.



On the better preserved face, on the inside of the flange on the right hand side of the septum below the bevel (when looked at in plan), there are two or three small angular indentations that are likely associated with working of the axe (e.g. hammering), but could represent the remains of decoration. The expansion of the blade is likely a combination of the original cast shape and hammering/working of the blade post-casting.



Very little of the original surface of the axe is preserved. On one face there is dark green patina, preserving subtler features, but this is overall pocked with pale green corrosion. The sides of the axe are similar pocked and the opposite face is almost entirely covered in green corrosive build-up, which is particularly extensive on the blade and cutting edge.



Length 122mm; blade width (tip to tip) 60.5mm; butt width 20.5mm; max. flange breadth 15mm; max. flange height c.2mm; bevel thickness (at centre) c.12.5mm; body width (at bevel) 26mm; weight 250.3g.","The height of the flanges (i.e. above 1.5mm) and overall form of the axe means it can be confidently classed as a low-flanged axe, datable to the Arreton assemblage (c.1725-1500 cal. BC)/Period 4 of the Early Bronze Age (Needham 1996; Needham et al. 1997). The axe can be classed as Type Arreton (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 72-75) or Class 5 (following Needham 1983; forthcoming). Class 5 axes can be further sub-divided by taking additional measurements according to Needham (1983; forthcoming), specifically relating to the 'mean relative width of the body (MRW)' i.e. the breadth of the body. This axe possesses a MRW of 0.75mm, which can be considered 'slender' and falls within Needham's (forthcoming) Class 5B Bisham.



Class 5B axes are known from across southern Britain, with examples of similar sizes from Syon Reach, Gloucestershire (Needham 1983, GL 20) and Milverton, Somerset (ibid., So 3/3). The depth of the Cowbridge blade/cutting edge (i.e. 26mm) is quite large considering the overall length of this axe, but an axe with similar proportions of length, blade depth and width can be observed in the Poslingford hoard, Suffolk (Needham 1983, Sf 26/7). This axe also has faceted flanges, though differs from the Cowbridge axe in having recurved blade tips and a shallower bevel.



The bevel on the Cowbridge axe is quite unusual and can be considered a 'stop-bump' (following Needham forthcoming), which anticipates the technological development of full stop ridges as seen on later flanged axes (specifically palstaves); this feature might thus indicate this axe can be dated later within the Arreton assemblage.



Needham (1983, 198) lists 179 Class 5 axes from southern Britain, indicating the broad currency of this axe type. In Wales, approximately 25 examples are currently known from both hoards and isolated contexts, with recent discoveries rapidly changing the image of how these axes were circulated. Class 5 axes are present in hoards from Menai Bridge, Anglesey (Savory 1980, 115, No.259), Llanover, Monmouthshire (NMGW-3F3BBC) and Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-0B9997). Single finds are also known from Margam, Neath Port Talbot (Savory 1976; 1980, 102, No.122), Bangor Is-y-coed, Wrexham (CPAT-9DFD01) and Llanbradach and Pwllypant, Caerphilly (NMGW-CD7412).",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,250.3,,,,122,1,Matthew Knight,Matthew Knight,Wales,the Vale of Glamorgan,the Vale of Glamorgan,Cowbridge with Llanblethian,SS9874,From a paper map,51.45575985,-3.46943322,NMGW-C21D78,,cowbridgeaxe.jpg,Bronze Age flanged axe,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mknight21/cowbridgeaxe.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/631085.jpg
860517,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-300,"A complete cast copper alloy moustache-like object probably dating from the Middle Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age (1500-300 BC).

The object consists of two pointed drop-shaped elements, D-shaped in cross-section and joined at their wider, rounded ends by a short, recessed oval neck. There are multiple longitudinal grooves on the upper face on both domed sides of the object, the tapering lower parts are plain. The two moustache tips or prongs flare slightly outwards and terminate with a small rounded knop. The central neck section of the object is plain and undecorated but the underside (between the two prongs) has a squared perforation, now filled with iron corrosion, presumably from whatever object the 'moustache' was mount on to.","These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45 and BH-AA1CBE.



The open area at the centre of the object suggests it was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-06-03T23:00:00Z,,,,11,,,8.7,21.1,1,Anni Byard,Anni Byard,South East,Oxfordshire,Vale of White Horse,Kingston Bagpuize with Southmoor,SU3995,From a paper map,51.65244492,-1.43767284,BERK-C3E5A3,,2017188.jpg,Unidentified object: Bronze Age mount,Oxfordshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abyard/2017188.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/627058.jpg

1. Ribbed socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: surviving length70.3mm; surviving blade width 44.2mm; width at upper break approx.33.5mm; surviving depth of socket approx. 49.0mm; surviving weight 110.9g.



Blade and body fragment of a ribbed socketed axe of bronze, with the mouth, loop, upper body and one side missing. Three near parallel ribs descend down each face. The surviving axe side is near straight, but slightly divergent toward the blade end, with a slight outward curvature near the blade. The surviving face edges are rounded giving the axe a sub-rectangular shaped cross-section. The surviving casting seam is visible but has been carefully filed or hammered down. On one lower face, there are striations running parallel with the blade edge and slightly higher up, striations running parallel with the long axis and at near right-angles with those nearer the blade edge. These suggest the axe was once prepared and sharpened for use. The original blade edge has been completely eroded away and the surviving edge surfaces are fragile with a light green patina. All break edges are fragile, with a light green patina. On the side which is largely missing, the surviving lower side area is also highly eroded, also with a light green patina. Original surfaces have a grey green patina. Across one face, near and at right angles to the ends of the face-ribs, there is a linear surface scar, which looks modern and may be slight damage caused when the axe was discovered and removed from the ground.



2. Probable plano-convex ingot fragment



Dimensions: maximum length 59.3mm; maximum width 39.5mm; maximum thickness 20.4mm; surviving weight 153.9g.



A solid and heavy copper fragment with two convex shaped sides and highly eroded surfaces. In cross-section, the fragment is thinnest near one of the convex shaped edges and significantly thickens to the second convex shaped edge, which has a near vertical but heavily eroded break edge. One surface is slightly irregular but nearing flat, while the underside has a marked convex curve as it thickens from edge toward deeper centre. The underside has a green patina, while the upper surface and breaks have large areas of brown coloured surface with localised areas of green surface concretions.","The socketed axe fragment (No. 1) may be identified as of a ribbed form, however insufficient of the axe survives to be able to identify it to precise type. The rounded face edges, carefully filed or hammered casting seam and generally slender, rather than blocky proportions of this axe would tend to suggest that this was not an example of a South Wales type axe (e.g. McNeil 1973; Moore 1978; Needham 1981; 1990, 38-41; Gwilt 2004; Burgess 2012; Northover unpublished). It is possible that this could once have been a Class B Southern English ribbed axe, or a ribbed axe of Breiddin, Croxton or Llanarth forms (Burgess 1963; Needham 1990, 32-8; Coombs 1991, 133 & 136, Cat. 138, Fig. 56; Northover unpublished, 267), however the absence of upper body and mouth elements prevent attribution with any degree of confidence. As a socketed axe, this artefact may confidently be dated to the Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC), while probably belonging to the latter Ewart Park phase of this period (1000-800 BC).



The second fragment (No. 2) has shape characteristics consistent with being a fragment of a plano-convex ingot. Typical features include a round or oval plan shape, with an irregular but flatter upper surface, with a convex shaped underside, shallow at margins and deepening towards the centre. Its eroded surfaces and breaks suggest the fragment had been within the upper aerated soil for some time. Metallurgical analysis of the probable ingot fragment has shown it to be made of copper, with traces of arsenic and silver detected. Such a composition is consistent with other examples of copper ingot fragments known within Late Bronze Age hoards in Wales (Gwilt et al 2011; 2014a & b). As such, a reasonable case can be made for the contemporaneity of these two artefacts, both of Late Bronze Age date and probably dating to the Ewart Park phase (1000-800 BC).



Plano-convex ingot fragments become common components of hoards towards the end of the Late Bronze Age. Over 40 Carp's Tongue hoards of Ewart Park date, mostly from East Anglia, Essex and Kent, reported as treasure between 2003 and 2008 have contained plano-convex ingots (also termed cake ingots and bun-shaped ingots) (DCMS 2004; 2007; British Museum 2008; 2009; 2010). In south-east Wales, the Cowbridge, Glascoed, Llancarfan and St Nicholas hoards have contained plano-convex copper alloy ingot fragments as a minority element represented within them (Gwilt 2004; 2008). In Pembrokeshire, ingot fragments appear to form a major component of the Late Bronze Age hoards from Freshwater West, Marloes & St Brides and Manorbier (Gwilt et al 2011; 2014b; Murphy unpublished; Northover unpublished, H. 140).



The account of the discovery of these two artefacts suggests that they were probably disturbed from their original burial context and dispersed from each other over a short distance (1.8m) in the recent past. It is probable that these two artefacts, and possibly additional objects now lost, were buried together in the ground at the same time, probably in a purpose dug small pit feature. It is likely that the objects were disturbed and became slightly dispersed through agricultural or earth moving activity during the recent past. It is possible that the mouth and loop end of the axe became damaged and lost when or after it was disturbed.

860724,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1000,"A worn fragment of cast probable Middle Bronze Age transitional or late looped palstave axe head.



The fragment of axe survives in the shape of a rough treapezium, with the wider, blade end being more rounded. In cross section it is rectangular to the narrower end and becomes more pointed oval in cross-section towards the blade edge. Due to have pitting no detail of casting seam or simialr casting imperfections are visible. In profile the cutting edge narrows to a rounded point, it is narrow which suggests that it is probably a transitional palstave, although due to wear it is not possible to be certain. There is a worn break across the body of the axe head, and much of the blade appears to be missing likely due to wear/resharpening. The axe head has a dark green mottled patina with patches of light great particularly around the heavy pitting on its surface. All edges are heavily worn suggesting much of the damage occured in antiquity.

The axehead has been damaged and is missing the loop that would have been attached to the top side. The blade has been worn down and is quite corroded, giving it a straigter profile rather than the more usual crescent. The sides of the axehead are smooth and the socket is almost circular in cross section. There is a defeined casting seam along the top and bottom edges. The axe has a slight taper from the blade but flares outward again at the socket. There is no decoration around the socket mouth.



There is a small knop of bronze on the inside of the socket which likely represents where the casting well was attached in the mould.

861289,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Probable Bronze Age gold strip fragment.



This is a semi-worked thickened strip fragment of gold of broadly rectangular shape. The strip has been worked and there are hammer facets visible on the flat surfaces and side margins. One edge has been hammered up and has a projecting margin on one face edge. The strip was broken at one end with a double-grip tool without sharp edges. As a result, there is widening, lateral distortion with thinning at one end, near the break. On one face, the break has created a near flat angled facet, while on the reverse there is a distinct concave curvature of the break, where gripped. The opposite end looks to have been snapped, rather than pulled, the break edge being irregular and with no thinning and minimal distortion of shape evident. Projecting burrs on the face edges look to have been hammered down. On one face, there is a linear crack evident in the metal along the axis of the strip, while a second smaller area of surface cracking is also evident. The gold has a yellowish tinge, rather than tending toward silver or having an orange hue.



Dimensions: maximum length 12.7mm; maximum width 8.5mm; maximum thickness 2.8mm; weight 2.37g.","Metallurgical analysis (Mary Davis)



Method



Semi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold strip was undertaken for the gold, silver and copper content of the gold fragment. This was achieved using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HH-XRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. The readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6µA for 100 live seconds.

Surface analysis is susceptible to distortions due to the asymmetry of whole objects (rather that flat polished samples). Surface corrosion can lead to the surface enrichment (e.g. tin) and depletion (e.g. zinc) of elements.



Results



Three spectra were taken of the object, which was found not to be particularly homogeneous in composition, and the overall results averaged:

Gold: 85-87%;

Silver: 10-12%

Copper: 2-2.5%



Interpretation



The amount of copper and silver present in the gold fragment is consistent with a typical Bronze Age composition. The results sit within the known range of compositions of gold objects from Wales of either Middle or Late Bronze Age date (e.g. Gwilt et al 2005, 36 & Fig. 4).



Identification & discussion (Adam Gwilt)



As a fragment of semi-worked gold, it is not possible to identify this with certainty to a class of finished gold artefact type of known period or date. The hammering and working technique observed on this fragment (see above description) is consistent with observed Bronze Age working technology, however is not, in itself, diagnostic to a particular date.

In this instance, it is the metallurgical analysis of the composition of this gold fragment which provides the most instructive evidence as to the possible age of this object. The high, but not refined gold content in this strip fragment, in the range of 85-87% gold and with 10-12% silver content is consistent with known Bronze Age gold compositions, to some degree reflecting the natural incidence of silver within alluvial gold ores. Copper was deliberately added to gold alloys in the Bronze Age, with the general trend for increasing proportions of copper with time, Late Bronze Age artefacts generally containing 4-10% copper and Early Bronze Age gold generally with less than 1% copper content (e.g. Hartmann 1980; Northover 1993, 517, Fig. 2). This strip, containing 2.0-2.5% copper sits in the overlap zone with other gold artefacts dating to the Middle and Late Bronze Age (Gwilt et al 2005, 36 & Fig. 4). Typically, Roman gold is highly refined, with the silver and copper content removed, giving the metal a more reddish colour.



Part-worked or re-worked fragments of Bronze Age gold are sometimes discovered, as single finds or as elements within hoards (e.g. Green 1983; Green & Northover 1996; Gwilt et al 2005; DCMS 2004, 19, Cat. & Fig. 11; DCMS 2007, 22-3, 26, & 39, Cats. & Figs. 5, 7, 17 & 25; British Museum 2008, 22 & 24, 273-5, Cats. & Figs. 27, 33 & 34). Their occurrence as single finds has been increasing in recent years, as better levels of reporting treasure finds have been achieved through the Portable Antiquities Scheme in England and Wales. Therefore, the possibility of this strip being a single find of Bronze Age date is also consistent with a wider reported pattern.



A preliminary search of the Heritage Environment Record for Monmouthshire has indicated there are no known Bronze Age or prehistoric sites in the immediate landscape vicinity of the find-spot.

861731,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1900,"A highly abraded Bronze Age copper alloy miniature flat axehead, probably dating to c. 2150-1900 BC. The axehead is broadly sub-rectangular in plan and rectangular in cross-section. The axe expands from a now rounded butt, 19.6mm wide, to the mid-point, 22.8mm wide. Below the mid-point, which is thickened in profile, 9.2mm thick compared to 4.6mm at the butt, there is break in angle, with the blade expanding to 28.2mm, where it terminates in a curved cutting edge. There is the suggestion of flanges running down either edge of the axehead, though they are difficult to discern by eye, and they are more prominent at the butt end - although the abrasion means that it is impossible to be sure if this was so originally.



Dimensions: length 63.3mm; width 28.2mm; thickness 9.2mm; weight 59.91g.



The axehead can be compared in terms of its general proportions to axes of the Brithdir metalworking phase published by Rohl and Needham (1998: fig. 24, esp. nos. 35 & 36), which share this example's relatively broad butt and lack of flaring blade tips. Although extremely small, a great variation in terms of size is a noted feature of axes of this period, with these smaller axes probably bing used for lighter woodworking (Moore & Rowlands 1972:13).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2017-08-15T23:00:00Z,,,59.91,,,9.2,63.3,1,Wil Partridge,Wil Partridge,South West,Devon,South Hams,Sparkwell,SX5858,Centred on field,50.40467111,-3.99957782,DEV-B0516A,,DEVB0516A.JPG,Bronze Age flat axehead,Somerset County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/wpartridgedev/DEVB0516A.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/627492.jpg

862530,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A complete copper alloy Middle Bronze Age unlooped palstave axehead (c.1500-c.1300 BC). The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves. These were the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age Schmidt and Burgess 1981). This particular axehead is probably a Group I (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, distinguished by its shield-shaped decoration below the stop ridge (ibid.p.119). The axe is sub-triangular in plan and sub-rectangular in section, tapering to the blade terminal. The blade is narrow tapering and the axe is narrow and unlooped and the butt is broken. The patination suggests that itv was broken in antiquity. The axe has a well-defined, rounded stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. There are two pronounced flanges on either side which have been filed smooth. The septum is smooth and seemingly unworn and slightly inwardly curving. At the end of the septum is a moulded shield-shaped stop-ridge set transversely across the body. The blade is flared and the surface is smooth, bevelled and sharpened. Group I and II palstaves were the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (ibid.p.119). This axe can be assigned to the Acton Park or early Taunton phase, circa 1450-1300 BC. The patination is a mid-green and pitting in the body of the axe suggests casting issues. The length is 160mm, the width is 53mm thickness 40mm and the weight too heavy for scales.



Pearce calls these palstaves 'the backbone of the Middle bronze Age industry' (page 23). They are a technical improvement on the ealrier flanged axes. The earliest palstaves lack side loops and have their blades decorated with a midrib (Group 1 type) like that from Chepstow, or with a shield pattern (Group 2 type). Early midrib and shield pattern palstaves were also being manufactured byt the Acton Park smiths of North Wales and by smiths in eastern Britain before 1400 BC.

The length is 150mm, the width is 27mm thickness 17mm and the weight 74.56g.



Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-09-03T23:00:00Z,2017-09-03T23:00:00Z,,,74.56,,,17,150,1,Stuart Noon,Stuart Noon,North West,Lancashire,Ribble Valley,Pendleton,SD7539,From finder,53.84663226,-2.38146836,LANCUM-D63A53,,LANCUMD63A53.jpg,,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/snoon/LANCUMD63A53.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/628468.jpg

863621,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1500,1300,"A copper alloy Middle Bronze Age unlooped palstave axehead (c.1500-c.1300 BC).



The axe is sub-triangular in plan and sub-rectangular in section, tapering to the blade terminal. The blade is narrow tapering and the axe is narrow and unlooped. The blade is flared and the surface is smooth, bevelled and sharpened. The butt is broken and the patination suggests that it was broken in antiquity. The axe has a well-defined stop-ridge on both sides rising at right angles to the septum. The septum is H-shaped in section and is smooth, unworn and slightly concave. At the end of the septum is a moulded shield-shaped stop-ridge set transversely across the body. The patination is a mid-green with areas of dark grey patination on both faces of the septum. The length is 100.22mm, the width is at the blade is 37.16mm and at the butt is 21.94mm. Its thickness is 6.62mm at the blade, 11.30mm at the butt and 19.66mm at the stop ridge. It weighs 166.2g.



The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops or midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group I (shield-pattern) type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC. It can be distinguished by its shield-shaped decoration below the stop ridge (p.119).



Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.



The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches.

The palstave has an oval shaped profile with the widest section being before the stop ridge closer to the butt end. At this widest section the palstave measures 27.06 mm in width.



The palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The flanges have suffered some damaged at the edges. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 26.38 mm in width and 6.12 mm thick. No side loop is present.



Beneath the stop-ridge descends a vertical rib that extends to the mid point on the upper blade. The blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical. The original surface is damaged. The cutting edge measures 59.11 mm in width and is 14.05 mm thick which includes the rib.



The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.



Early Midribbed Palstaves belongs to the Acton Park metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. This example is similar to Group II - Early Midribbed Type Chepstow; similar to an example from Kilnoterie, Scotland (p127 cat no 794 plate 58, No. 789). 



There are other axeheads of the Early Palstave Group II - Early Mid-ribbed Type recorded on the PAs database and discovered in Warwickshire such as WAW-245FB6 and WMID-7493D3. 



Overall the palstave measures 150.8 mm in length, a maximum width of 59.11 mm at the cutting edge, and a maximum thickness near the stop ridge of 27.06 mm. It weighs 292.3 g.

The present 73mm diameter annular shape is formed from circular-section bronze rod which has been twisted into a spiral. The ends slightly overlap and both have been broken in antiquity. On one of the broken ends the twist and cross-section begins to taper-off suggesting that the break is close to a missing hooked-end terminal. The other end is an abrupt break across full twist and cross-section. The evidence strongly suggests that this object is part of a larger penannular twisted torc, that has broken and been reformed into a bracelet-sized loop. It is a matter of conjecture as to whether this happened as a result of deliberate re-puposing, ceremonial practice or simple coincidence. Approximately 50% of the objects surface is covered with a dark green patina, the remainder comprises a lighter green mottled corrosion product formed from the breakdown of the patina.

The axe is near-complete but is heavily corroded with some peripheral loss (with a surviving length of 132.4mm and a weight of 295.4g). The butt is rounded (with a width of 31.1mm) and it is now uncertain how much rounding has resulted from corrosion. The sides of the axe are comparatively straight and gradually divergent to the blade. One side expands more sharply below the blade and suggests that the blade originally had at least a moderately expanded blade edge (with a surviving blade width of 56.2mm). The long profile of the axe is lenticular and the better preserved face has the suggestion of a median bevel (occurring approximately 60mm from the butt, where the axe has a maximum thickness of 12.0mm). A small fragment of the surface survives on the side of the face, just above the median bevel where a weak flange is discernible. A blade facet is evident on the better preserved face (13mm from the blade edge). The original blade edge has been lost and is now moderately rounded. Small remnant patches of the original surface survive which show that the axe was decorated with short linear and parallel marks or 'rain-pattern' decoration. A longer surviving strip of surface appears to show where the decoration ends (32mm from the blade) and the surface then exhibits striations running along the blade, probably from sharpening. The surface patina is dark-brown and elsewhere is heavily-pitted with a pale to mid-green corrosion.","Metallurgical analysis was attempted, where the axe was examined whole within the specimen chamber. Where possible, areas of metal exposed from under the surface corrosion were analysed and apart from very superficial surface swabbing of the artefacts there was no sample preparation. The results are semi-quantitative and overall totals taken from minimally prepared surfaces are usually affected to some degree by the surface geometry of the artefacts, including factors such as curvature, pitting and indentations etc. Other factors that can also affect the results include surface oxidation, surface enrichment or depletion of certain elements, contamination from closely adhering dirt, and preferential corrosion.



Three separate readings were taken and the majority of the overall totals acquired were slightly low due to the factors described above. The results were normalised to 100% to obtain consistency between the readings and to make the analyses comparable with other results the average compositions were: 79-86% copper, 14-20% tin with minimal amounts of lead detected (0.1-0.2%). Minor amounts of antimony (0.2-0.8%), sulphur (0.2%), nickel (0.3%) and arsenic (0.1-0.3%) were also detected.

870386,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"Early Bronze Age bronze ogival dagger of Camerton-Snowshill Type (following Gerloff 1975), or Series 5D (following Needham 2015) and of Needham's (1996)  Period 4-5, probably dating from c.1600 to 1400BC.



The dagger is incomplete, missing the tip and with peripheral damage (with a surviving length of 67.8mm and a weight of 32.2g). The butt end is eroded and of uncertain form but now with a straight top edge (with a surviving width of 25.6mm and a minimum thickness of 1.8mm), possibly suggesting it was originally of trapezoidal form. There appears to have been three rivet holes, for plug-rivets, two of which are evident, including a central rivet hole (of 6.2mm diameter). The side rivet is less well preserved (with a diameter of 5mm). The dagger widens and thickens to the top of the blade, incorporating the prominent midrib (giving the blade a maximum surviving width of 34.5mm and a maximum thickness of 6.5mm). The central midrib is widest at the hilt (at 19mm), with straight and convergent sides, gradually narrowing to the break (where it has a width of 9mm). Flanking the midrib on each side are three to four decorative rounded ridges, separated from each other by grooves. The decorative ridges are very slightly concave, extending from the butt to the break. There is the suggestion that the decorative ridges may continue as far as the better preserved side rivet hole. There is no convincing evidence of pointillé decoration on the midrib, or elsewhere on the blade. At the break (where the blade has a width of 16mm and a thickness of 4.5mm) the blade has a gentle bend, suggesting the tip was bent prior to breaking in antiquity. Both blade edges have been lost, but there are discernible sharpening striations running along both blade edges on both faces. The surface is partially preserved with a dark-brown patina and is heavily-pitted. The corrosion on both faces at the hilt has a V-shaped form, extending onto the midrib and may possibly suggest a V-shaped hilt handle, which would be unusual, and differs from the more common omega-shaped arrangement at the hilt.","Metallurgical analysis was conducted using X-ray fluorescence, demonstrating that the metal is an arsenical tin-bronze and is consistent with Early and Middle Bronze Age alloys.



The incomplete and corroded nature of the dagger makes precise typological identification difficult. The straight heel edge may be comparatively intact, which would tentatively suggest a trapezoidal butt arrangement, characteristic of the Camerton Type, as defined by Gerloff (1975, pp 104). Camerton-Snowshill daggers are generally deposited within burials and have a date range that is believed to span the Early to Middle Bronze Age transition, dated to c. 1600 - 1400. In Wales the dagger can be paralleled with an example recovered from Ystradyfodwg (Savory, 1980, pp 132, no. 335) , on the border of Glyncorrwg, Neath-Port Talbot and Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taff.

The dagger is incomplete, missing the hilt and is slightly distorted (with a surviving length of 112.1mm and a weight of 31.5g). The damaged butt is now of indeterminate form (with a maximum surviving width of 30.7mm and a thickness of 0.8mm) but there is the remains of a rivet hole or notch at the apex of the centre (of approximately 5.3mm diameter). The dagger thickens at its centre to form a prominent, rounded midrib (reaching a maximum thickness of 6.2mm, 30mm from the damaged butt), which narrows and becomes more angular towards the tip. The dagger is decorated with two prominent grooves, beginning at the butt and converging along the midrib (approximately 27mm from the tip). There is the suggestion of a third, outer groove at the butt, which goes on to define the edge of the midrib and start of the blade and continues to the tip. There is no evidence for punched-dot pointillé decoration on the dagger. The blade is flat sectioned (0.6mm - 1.2mm thick) and narrows slightly towards the tip (with a width of 4.5mm near the butt and 2mm near the tip). The original blade edge has largely been lost and the edge is near-straight and gradually convergent to the tip. There are no sharpening striations discernible on the small areas of surviving surface preserved along the blade. The dagger has received a blow to one face at its midpoint, probably in antiquity and resulting in slight distortion and surface damage, comprising a short diagonal groove on the midrib (approximately 2mm long and 0.7mm wide) and stress lines evident on the surface. The surface has a dark-brown patina with areas of pale brown corrosion with patches of bright-green surface loss. The patina may be preserved with an omega-like mark on one face, possibly suggesting the remains of a hilt.","The fragmentary condition of the dagger butt makes precise typological identification difficult. The central rivet hole or notch arrangement, characteristic of the Camerton Type, as defined by Gerloff (1975, pp 104) . Camerton-Snowshill daggers are generally deposited within burials with a largely Wiltshire and Dorset distribution and have a date range that is believed to span the Early to Middle Bronze Age transition, dated to c. 1600 - 1400. The wetland context for this findspot is unlikely to suggest that it accompanied a burial. In Wales the dagger can be paralleled with an example recovered from Ystradyfodwg (Savory, 1980, pp 132, no. 335) , on the border of Glyncorrwg, Neath-Port Talbot and Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taff. A similar fragmentary dagger with a slightly broader butt and also of Camerton - Snowshill Series was reported to PAS  and recovered from approximately 4Km to the south.

Discussion: This hoard of three socketed tools, two complete bun ingots and 22 fragments of bun ingot is consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, especially with the Ewart Park phase (c.1000 – 800 BC) (cf. Needham 1990). Perhaps the most notable feature of the hoard is the relative paucity of socketed tools compare to ingot (fragments and complete). Complete (or near complete) bun ingots formed part of the Bexley Heath hoard, Essex (Turner 2010, 126-39, no. 15). Other relevant comparanda include the hoard from ‘Burnham on Crouch’, Essex, which contained socketed tools, weapons and fragments of copper alloy ingot (Treasure case 2010 T509), and the hoard from ‘East Colchester’, Essex, which contained socketed tools, complete and fragmentary ingot fragments (Treasure case 2004 T116).

873275,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Cast bronze socketed axe of Late Bronze Age date (1000 - 800 BC). The axe is sub-rectangular in plan with a flared convex cutting edge and the socket is sub-rectangular in cross section. The axe measures 99.6mm length, 45.8mm in width at the blade, 35.8mm at the socket, it is 33.7mm thick and weighs 174.25 grams. The depth of the socket is 65.3mm.



The socket of the axe is sub-rectangular with patinated breaks around three sides which have removed the original end of the socket. The remaining complete section has a single swollen moulded collar up to 8.6mm wide. Only the inner stub of the loop survives the middle is missing to an old break and the other end has been lost with the mouth suggesting it was on or adjacent to the collar.



The two long sides of the axe are plain and expand slightly along the length of the socket and terminate with an expanded blade. The casting flashes on the sides of the axe have been hammered. The expanded blade has a curved convex (crescent shaped) cutting edge which is complete but has a corroded surface so it is not clear if it was prepared for use or suffered use damage.



The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where this patina has been lost - probably through abrasion.



In general socketed axes are rarer in Somerset than palstaves. The axe appears similar to Savory (1980) no. 200 and 281-9. from Llanberis and Llantwich Major.

The blade is 33 mm long and expands to a width of 20.5 mm, with a bevelled edge that is 3 mm wide at the widest point of the blade. Below the blade on each side of the socket there is a side loop for binding the spearhead to the spear shaft.

The circular perforation is 3 mm in diameter and 4 mm in from the V-shaped notch above which is 19 mm long and 9 mm wide at the opening. The base of the blades on either side of the tang are slightly concave leading to heel-shaped corners which then curve outwards around the perforation and inwards again towards the notch. The blades are almost semi-circular in plan and are 60 mm long and together they are 54 mm wide towards the base. The tang is 35 mm long and 8 mm wide at the base of the blade and 2.7 mm thick and tapers to 5 mm wide and 2 mm thick at the tip.



This decorated bifid razor is classified as a Type Feltwell (Jockenhövel 1980) and dates from the Late Bronze Age from the Wilburton to the Ewart park phase, c.900-700 BC (Matt Knight pers comm).



Type Feltwell razors are common in Scotland and England, less so in Wales and Ireland. Rare examples can also be found on the Continent (Jockenhövel 1980; Plate 50, Map A).

875082,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete copper-alloy, flanged axehead, dating from the final phase of the Early to the earliest Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000 - 1500 BC). Possibly of Arreton type dated to Early Bronze Age III, of metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 BC or possibly of a Central European type known as a 'Randleistenbeil' dating to a similar period of time (Huegelgraeber-Bronzezeit Reinecke A/B)



Description: The axehead survives as the blade end and about a third of its original length. It has flanged parallel sides whcih runs along the back of the blades to the tip. The blade itself is a wide crescent shape with upturned corners. There is a very shallow stop ridge, now difficult to discern. Although not complete the flanges appear to narrow towards the body/butt end of the axehead. The axehead's surface is heavily patinated and pitted with some abrasion along the edges and the break is heavily abraded and likely having occured in antiquity.



Measurements: 53.43mm long, 53.05mm wide, 13.18mm thick and 127.8g in weight



Discussion: The superficially seems to fit with the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 415, 422 and 425). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Their work though only looks directly at the axes of Scotland and Northern England. 



Similar examples have been found at Margam, Port Talbot (Savory 1980, No. 122) and Breach Farm, Vale of Glamorgan (Savory 1980, No. 338) associated with a cremation burial recently radiocarbon dated to c. 1750 - 1600 BC.

875083,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Cast copper alloy socketed hammer, rectangular in plan and sub-rectangular in section below the raised collar, with three ribs on either face, that dates from the Late Bronze Age (c.1000-800 BC). The mid-rib is more pronounced than those on either side, measuring 3 mm in height. All of the ribs are 5 mm in thickness. There are pronounced casting seams down both sides of the hammer that are 1.5 mm in thickness, suggesting that the hammer was unfinished as these have not been filed down. There is no evidence of it having any side loop. The collar is 5 mm deep and protrudes 3 mm outwards from one face but it is only 3 mm deep and 1.5 mm thick on the oppposite face and uneven around the upper edge. The socket mouth is lozenge-shaped externally in plan and circular internally and is 25 mm wide and 22 mm deep externally and 14 mm in diameter internally. The body of the hammer is slightly waisted and tapers towards the middle and then expands towards the terminal to a flattened but slightly exapnded convex base that is 30 mm wide by 13 mm deep. This working face has been well used with the typical side protuberances from that use.



Socketed hammers became more widespread during the Penard phase (c.1200-950 BC). Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart Park Phase (c.800-700 BC) which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800 BC. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples like this one have collars and moulding.



Whilst hammers are traditionally considered to have a higher tin content in the bronze (Evans 1881) compared to contemporary axes, a large number of records on this database note that based on the weight of the hammers a high lead content is also likely. It is therefore interesting to note that, whilst better preserved and slightly larger than many other examples, this hammer is also heavier than most.



Similar examples can be seen in records WAW-75FD95 and SOM-B048D1 on the database.



The Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website (https://finds.org.uk/guides/bronzeage/objects/hammers) comments that the ""socketed hammer is only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976, 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA'.""

875084,Razor,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-600,"Cast copper alloy 'Hallstatt' razor of Type Unterstall or Poiseul (Matt Knight pers comm) that dates from the Lyn Fawr phase of the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, c.800-600 BC. The razor is trapezoidal in plan with two suspension loops above a row of four 'hanging triangles' or triangular openwork. The blade edge is only 2 mm in thickness. There is some damage to each side of the blade where it expands to a pointed apex, now missing. There is a small patch of green corrosion where one of these edges is folded, but apart from that, the razor is in an excellent and stable condition and has a dark brown patina.



Type Unterstall or Poiseul razors have trapezoidal shaped blades, a strengthening rib between the two rings and the blade and have, like Felkirch or Bernissart razors, decorative perforations in the upper part of the blade. However, while the perforations in Feldkirch or Bernissart razors are circular or rectangular, Unterstall or Poiseul razors have triangular ones. Jockenhövel lists their main distribution in southern France, southwest Bavaria and northern Germany, with finds from, for example: Magny-Lambert, Dép. Côte-d'Or and Poiseul-la-Ville-et-La-Perrière, Dép. Côte-d'Or (Jockenhövel 1980, 176-177). He suggests that, in general, their region of origin would have been somewhere in Western Europe where these razors of Type Unterstall or Poiseul, along with razors of Types Felkirch or Bernissart, Endingen and Flörsheim, represented the most typical group of Early Iron Age razors. Jockenhövel's suggested Western European distribution of this type can now be underlined with seven new finds from the southern half of England: Wickham Skeith, Suffolk; St Alban's, Hertfordshire; Salisbury/Netherhampton hoard, Wiltshire; Bowerchalke, Wiltshire; Royston, Cambridgeshire, recorded in LANCUM-DB7650; Attleborough, Norfolk, recorded in NMS-01D7D8, and this example from near Newbury in Berkshire. Early Iron Age razors like these are usually found singly or in hoards, and another individual one has come up recently from Milnthorpe, Cumbria, recorded in LANCUM-220D90 (Dot Boughton pers comm).

These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45, BERK-C3E5A3 and BH-AA1CBE.

The open area at the centre of the object suggests it was meant to top something that fitted into this gap. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,14.2,,,13.03,23.5,1,Ellie Cox,Ellie Cox,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,Kettering,Dingley,SP7587,From finder,52.47578687,-0.89720905,NARC-2C32D7,,NARC2C32D7.jpg,NARC-2C32D7 : Moustache-shaped object : Bronze Age - Iron Age,Northamptonshire County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC2C32D7.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/637676.jpg

877085,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"TREASURE CASE : 2017 T1115.



A hoard of six Bronze Age copper-alloy axe heads, found in a stream. Five of the axe heads are socketed axes and one is a relatively rare example of a late palstave from a Ewart Park hoard (although other examples are known from East Yorkshire, see discussion, below). All six of the axe heads date to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1000 - 800 BC). Socketed axe specialist Dr Dot Boughton has suggested a very late 9th - early 8th century BC date (pers. comm.).



Note on condition: All axes have suffered the effects of being deposited in water, with patchy green and light brown copper-corrosion and some encrusting. One of the socketed axes (No. 2) was sand-blasted after discovery. This has markedly affected the condition of the axe.



Four of the axe heads are of the Yorkshire type typical of the area. It is possible that some of the Yorkshire types may be from the same mould.



(1) Complete copper-alloy socketed axe head with loop, Yorkshire type. The axe head is wedge-shaped with a square socket mouth of uneven thickness and single mouth-moulding forming a heavy collar. The loop sits below this; it is broadly lozenge-shaped in section and wide in plan, narrowing at the juncture towards the socketed end of the axe head. The cutting edge of the axe head is flared and still sharp. A casting seam is visible externally running longitudinally down both sides of the axe head and down the outer surface of the loop. Further casting seams are apparent running down all four faces internally and a small casting lip protrudes straight up from the middle of the edge of the socket mouth on the wide face (with the loop to the right). Of all the Yorkshire type axe heads within this hoard, this example has survived in the best condition; while there is a large degree of light brown and green copper-alloy corrosion, there are also smooth dark brown patches and the outline of the axe head is clear. The smooth brown surface is marked with shallow scratches and dents. Surface detail has been largely obscured by patches of corrosion at the socket end of the axe head, but three equally spaced ridges can just be made out running longitudinally down from below the socket collar on each face; these apparently terminate before the halfway point although it is not clear exactly where. The interior surface of the socket is covered with lumpy green and white accretions from being deposited in water.



Dimensions:



Length: 83.96mm. Socket Width: 38.03 x 39.35mm. Socket wall thickness: 6.63mm. Blade width: 51.63mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 23.27 x 10.42mm; interior dimensions: 11.16 x 4.36mm. Weight: 226g.



(2) Complete copper-alloy socketed axe head with double-mouth moulding and loop, Yorkshire type. The axe head is wedge-shaped with a ridged sub-rectangular socket mouth of unequal thickness. There is a less prominent ridge running parallel below the socket mouth and three ridges running downwards from this at a right-angle can just be made out. Unfortunately, however, the original surface and much of the detail has been lost due to the axe head being sand-blasted after discovery. This may affect the measurements of the axe head. The surface of the axe head is now a dull grainy light brown. A loop protrudes from the less prominent ridge on one of the narrower faces of the axe head. The loop is broadly D-shaped in section and narrows at mid-point. The cutting edge of the axe head flares. There is a small lip protruding straight up from the long edge of the mouth socket (with the loop on the right), a relic of the casting process. A casting seam is also still visible running longitudinally down both of the narrow faces and down the outer surface of the loop. Sand-blasting has altered the top fifth of the inner surface of the axe head, but the bottom part retains a rough light-green patina from copper-alloy corrosion. There is an irregularly-shaped white stone wedged in the socket from the stream bed.



Dimensions:



Length: 84.03mm. Socket Width: 34.38 x 41.00mm. Socket wall thickness: 6.46mm. Blade width: 49.29mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 18.97 x 6.78, narrowing to 3.95mm; interior dimensions: 9.17 x 6.13mm. Weight: 219g.



(3) Copper-alloy socketed axe head with loop, apparently deliberately crushed. The axe head is broadly sub-rectangular in shape with both of the short ends flaring, but only narrowing at the cutting edge. The socket mouth is now sub-rectangular in shape, with curved corners. The socket mouth is ridged and compression has caused fractures to appear. There is a less prominent ridge below the socket mouth, running parallel with it. A loop protrudes from this ridge to one side; it is broadly lozenge-shaped in section. A casting seam runs longitudinally down both narrow faces and the loop, visible externally. The surface of this axe head is very patchy, mainly rough light brown patches with some smooth dark brown areas and green copper-alloy corrosion. There is slight encrustation due to the deposition of the axe in water. Some of the roughness of the surface is caused from casting flashes that have not been filed away; this may suggest that the axe head was unfinished. The cutting edge of the axe head is bevelled, however, suggesting that it has been subject to sharpening. It is impossible to tell whether sharpening extended to the full length of the blade on both sides on account of the encrusted nature of the axe head.



Dimensions:



Length: 90.56mm. Socket Width: 25.39 x 47.78mm. Socket wall thickness: 6.97mm. Blade width: 52.64mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 20.69 x 8.58mm; interior dimensions: 5.89 x 4.35mm. Weight: 239g.



(4) Complete copper-alloy socketed axe head with loop. The axe head is wedge-shaped with a square ridged socket mouth of uneven thickness. There is a section missing from the ridge at the corner between the wide face and the face with the loop (with the loop to the right). This probably occurred during manufacture. The loop is wide and rectangular in section, narrowing very slightly at the juncture towards the socket mouth. There is a casting seam visible running longitudinally down the opposite face and a seam running longitudinally between the socket mouth ridge and the loop, but not below it. The cutting edge of the axe head flares and is slightly notched. Within the socket is a sandy concretion of organic matter and white stone from the stream bed. Small white mineral deposits have also formed accretions on the exterior surface. Otherwise, the axe head has a rough light brown surface with light green patches of copper-corrosion and smooth dark brown patches.



Dimensions:



Length: 82.21mm. Socket Width: 37.85 x 38.32mm. Socket wall thickness: 7.54mm. Blade width: 51.83mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 20.43 x 9.98mm; interior dimensions: 9.54 x 4.29mm. Weight: 218g.



(5) Complete copper-alloy faceted axe head of the Meldreth type. The axe head is long and slender with a convex cutting edge that flares and curves round into two sharp points. At the other end is a trumpet-shaped collar at the socket mouth. A ridge with central groove runs around the edge of the square-shaped socket mouth. The other side of the trumpet collar is demarcated by a parallel, although less prominent, ridge. There are four facets on each side of the blade. A loop projects to the side from the bottom of the trumpet collar; this is broadly lozenge-shaped in section with a casting seam running longitudinally down the middle of both sides. The casting seam on the outer side extends to the length of the axe head, with a matching seam on the opposite side of the axe head. These are not apparent internally. View of the socket is obscured by stone and organic detriment built up from the stream. Casting flashes remain on the outer surface of the axe head, giving it a bumpy outline. Otherwise, the axe head has a rough light brown patina with some smooth dark brown patches and areas of light green copper-alloy corrosion.



Dimensions:



Length: 105.75mm. Socket Width: 32.54 x 36.41mm. Socket wall thickness: 7.32mm. Blade width: 54.04mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 23.70 x 7.57mm; interior dimensions: 7.57 x 4.98mm. Weight: 227g.



(6) Complete copper-alloy palstave with loop. The palstave belongs to the Late Palstave group (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 158-64), and can be placed within Type Isleham (Ibid., 161-2). The palstave is broadly rectangular in profile, widening towards the cutting edge. It is lozenge-shaped when viewed from the side, tapering to the sharp cutting edge and narrowing at the opposite end to a squared butt. It has a rectangular septum with a curved depression in the middle of the short outer edge that forms the butt end; the septum separates the straight-sided open flanges on either side which flare out from a point below the butt end to a stop ridge, forming the widest part of the lozenge-section. The flange on the side of the loop (when the loop is to the left) is missing a section, leaving a rectangular gap. The loop similarly protrudes from the widest point of the lozenge; the loop is pentagonal in section, having a wide, shallow ridge running longitudinally down the outer face and a sharper casting ridge running longitudinally down the inner face. Three ribs extend longitudinally down from the stop ridge on the two wider faces. The palstave has a rough patchy patina, with light brown and green corrosion and smooth dark brown patches. Stony white accretions from the water have built up in the juncture between the flanges and the septum and sandy organic material has built up in the loop.



Dimensions:



Length: 142.49mm. Length of blade (from cutting edge to stop ridge): 83.91mm. Blade width: 37.53mm. Length of septum: 52.87mm. Width of septum: 23.40mm. Loop - exterior dimensions: 24.77 x 9.80mm; interior dimensions: 12.16 x 4.99mm. Weight: 382g.



Discussion:



This hoard is notable for containing a range of axe types dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 - 800 BC) (cf. Rohl & Needham 1998, 105-6). Some are very common in Northern England (e.g. Yorkshire types: Nos. 1 and 2, above) while others have stronger affinities with the south of England (e.g. Everthorpe and South-Eastern types: Nos. 3-5, above). The palstave axehead (No. 6, above) is a notable addition to a small number of late palstaves from Northern England (see Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 158-64; Burgess 1968, 14, f.n. 60). In this respect the hoard can be compared to the Sproutley hoard, East Riding, which contained a late palstave (of type Worthing) along with South-Eastern, Yorkshire and Everthorpe (and other) type socketed axes (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, pl. 66). The large hoards from Driffield, East Riding (Treasure cases 2016 T239 & 2016 T240), also contained a similar mixture of socketed axe types, although they did not include any late palstaves (see Huisman & Haldenby 2018 for full discussion). In short this hoard is consistent with what we know of depositional practices and hoard composition during the latest centuries of the Bronze Age in East Yorkshire (c.1000 - 800 BC).



It is interesting that one of the axe heads seems to have been deliberately damaged prior to deposition. While the stream in which these axe heads were found appears to be modern, it may follow the route of an original gully. A nearby road name contains the name 'mire' and the area looks to be on the margins of a small island which sits above an area of carr/moss. It seems, therefore, that these axe heads were deposited within the context of a liminal boundary between wet and dry land, potentially on the very edge of the wetland or within a stream which runs seasonally (Peter Reavill, pers. com.).



Conclusion: 



The hoard qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 regarding prehistoric metalwork assemblages.

The socket is circular in cross-section and the socket extends just into the base of the blade midrib. There is a side loop on each side of the socket, positioned very close to the end of the object, away from the blade. The spear head is 124.5mm long, 30.4mm wide and 20.6mm thick. It weighs 103.49gm. The internal diameter of the socket is 15.5mm. It has a smooth golden brown patina with only slight pitting and corrosion.



Davis (2017) notes that ""Spearheads from the earlier MBA were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket.

877224,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"Cast copper alloy unlooped palstave axe probably dating to the Middle Bronze Age palstave 1500 to 1150BC. The axe shares similarities with the Taunton metalwork assemblage and Hotham related to the palstaves of the Acton Park metalwork assemblage to which it bears some resemblance similar to Needham et al fig 140 (1985) and Read (1995: p.3 fig 9 ) Dated to 1200 BC. The axe is almost complete and is relatively long with a length of 150mm. The butt is slightly concave and has a width of 30mm. The flanges are flat, longiform in plan, straight and parallel as far as the stop but do not extend all the way to the butt, with a width at the stop of 30mm. The blade is flaring 72mm wide with a slightly bevelled facet possibly as a result of hammering. The septum is very small and hard to discern and the edge of the butt maybe slightly broken. The axe has a green patina with green colouration in patches and there are various nicks along the length The axe is 30mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.

The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops or midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group II type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC.

Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.

The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches

Only a small section remains with a part of the original edge and very worn irregular breaks on the other sides. The section of the outside edge is too small to idenify the complete diameter.

An undated copper alloy object, a fragment of casting debris (a casting jet) from metal working. The object is cone-shaped with a deep well in the centre and a thick stubby runner beneath, which would have flowed into the mould. The runner has several incised lines around it that may be tooling marks from when the jet was detatched from the mould, or may indeed be evidence of the tool working on the mould itself. The casting jet has a light green patina with much blackened material across and around it. Although it is not possible to identify the period with certainty, the patina suggests this casting jet is probably Bronze Age in date.

877566,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead blade with a larger, heavy blade which suggests it was produced during the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. The asymmetric casting with a misaligned core has caused one socket wall (11 mm thick) to be much thicker than the other (4 mm thick). This does not appear to have prevented the axehead from having been prepared and used. The socketed axe appears to have been deliberately broken in antiquity, most likely while hot from recent experimental research (Matt Knight pers comm). The blade has broken off below the socketed body of the axe where any decoration, probably in the form of longitudinal parallel ribs, would have terminated. There is a deep longitudinal groove on one face but this is more recent damage since deposition. The end of the socket is internally 28 mm long, 7 mm wide and 20 mm deep.



See CORN-37D710 for an axehead from the St Buryan hoard with a similar slightly expanded blade and three parallel ribs on each face with is part of the Ewart Park metalwork assemblage, dating from c.950-850 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example from St. Erth, that is in Penzance Museum, on page 565, plate 4, no.43a, which is classified as a Stogursey-type socketed axe, but is also referred to as a South Wales type, but without the complete axehead, it cannot be classified.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-10-27T23:00:00Z,2017-11-05T00:00:00Z,,,144.65,,,19,50,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Deviock,SX3355,Generated from computer mapping software,50.37113783,-4.34975321,CORN-E91A21,,DSCN5968.JPG,socketed axe blade (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN5968.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/645054.jpg
877584,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"Incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axehead with a square socket and the remains of a side loop and decorated with three converging moulded ribs on both faces, dating from the Late Bronze Age. The axehead is missing most of its collar and only has two stubs where the integral side loop would have joined them together. The surface is corroded and pitted with patches of light green oxidisation, but most of the dark green surface patina remains on the blade. The longest surviving rib on the face of the axe is 56 mm long and 3 mm wide. The axehead is slender in form and bears features that are most directly comparable with the South Welsh type, such as the three converging ribs, square socket and side loop descending from the collar moulding, which date from the Ewart Park metalwork phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. However, the axe most closely conforms with Schmidt and Burgess' (1981, 173-175) Gwithian type. This type is based on a mould for a slender socketed axe found in the occupation layers at Gwithian, Cornwall (Burgess 1976; Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 174). In the same occupational layer, two Continental bronze pins were also found, which broadly date to the Penard phase of the British Bronze Age (c.1300-1100 BC) (Needham 1981, 34). Thus Gwithian-type axes might predate the typical South Welsh type socketed axes from the Ewart Park phase and could date to the Penard or possible Wilburton phase (1300-1000 BC). Due to the uncertainty around dating these axes, it is perhaps best to give a broad date from 1200-800 BC, which equates to the Middle-Late Bronze Age in Britain. Other Gwithian type axes are known as single finds such as from near Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales (Burgess 1976, 71), and Sedgemoor and Loxton Hill, both Somerset (Pearce 1983, Nos. 673 and 678) (Matt Knight pers comm).



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar socketed axehead with parallel sides, a sub-rectangular section and three converging ribs on each face, from Kingsbridge in Devon, on page 95, pl.15, no.139.

The circular socketed end is broken and partly missing, with an internal diameter of 13 mm at the broken edge, and the cutting edge is worn, partly through use, with its orginal surface missing. The gouge tapers in profile from the open end to a point at the cutting edge which is curved into a semi-circle so that it can gouge out sections of wood or other materials. The surface is corroded and pitted but most of the original patina remains on both sides of the gouge. Socketed gouges are first seen in the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The blade is trapezoidal in plan, triangular in profile, tapering towards the cutting edge, and rectangular in section at the broken edge. The blade was originally crescentic with expanded pointed terminals but has been worn to rounded terminals. The blade narrows towards the broken end, which is below where the transverse stop ridge would have been, stopping the haft or handle from sliding down the blade when the axe was being used. The blade is too corroded and pitted to see if there was any decoration at the narrower broken end between the flanges.



Flanged axes with crescentic blades can be found during the Arreton metalwork phase of metalworking assemblage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 3 (c.2000-1700 BC), such as the Class 5 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 127, fig.28, no.89).

The axe head has lost part of the socket and some of the body from the aperture towards the point. The apeture is sub rectangular where it can be seen. The blade of the axe has a very slight curve at both sides, and is 39.79mm wide,  and 27.42mm wide above the socket. The aperture measures 18.98 by 23.81mm. On both the front and reverse of the axe is a single rib. The body is slightly facetted towards the edges and both sides are sub triangular in shape: the apex of the triangle is at the point of the blade. As well as the structural damage to the axe there is some minor damage, wear and corrosion whether due to age more recent damage cannot be determined. Much of the original surface is missing.

Based on comparison with a similar axe in Schmidt & Burgess (1981, pl. 89, no. 1369) the axae discusssed above is of the Yorkshire type, and dates to the Late Bronze Age (c.900-800BC). Yorkshire  Type axes have a wide distribution through East Anglia and northwards into central Sotland (Ibid, p223). The type was well represented in both the Bowes Moor hoards (DUR-308251 and DUR-1F5057).

880152,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1500,-300,"~~An incomplete copper alloy moustache-like object probably dating from the Middle Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age (1500-300 BC).

This has a hollow bulbous body one end of which narrows to a fine point giving an overall tear drop shape. To the side of the wider end is a hole 9mm long by 5mm wide. The wider body of the object has fine latitudinal lines the run around its circumference with only the pointed tip remaining undecorated.


These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples such as this item while others are 'double' see YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45 and BH-AA1CBE.

882082,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"An almost complete cast copper alloy, socketed spearhead of Davis Group 13, dating from the Late Bronze Age. The spearhead can be described as a pegged leaf-shaped socketed spearhead with lanceolet blade and circular sectioned mid-rib. It dates from c. BC 1000 - BC 800.



The spearhead has an elongated leaf-shaped blade, the edges of which are bevelled and still sharp. The very tip of the blade is damaged. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) lozenge shaped midrib. The midrib expands towards the base to form the socket, the socket has an internal diameter of 20.6 mm and the wall is 2.1 mm thick. Mid-way down the socket there are opposing circular peg holes, (measuring 5.4 mm in diameter). The blade is broadly leaf or flame shaped in plan, and in section the wings are triangular. The cutting edge is present and is bevelled. There doesn't appear to be evidence of use or sharpening on the surface. The wings taper in at the base towards the peg holes. There is a modern break situated about half way up the blade, and a piece missing from here on the reverse of the object. There is a triangular groove above the peg holes on the front face of the socket.



The tip part measures 86.3 mm in length and is 29.7 mm wide at base and 4.7 mm wide at tip. It has a thickness of 9.2 mm and weighs 41.0 g.



The socket part measures 117.5 mm in length and is 31.1 mm wide at top and 26.3 mm wide at base. It has a thickness of 14.5 mm and weighs 84.0 g.



The total length of the object is 196 mm. The maximum width is 31.3 mm and the maximum thickness is 14.5 mm. The total weight of the spear is 125.1 g.



The object is a mid green in colour with an uneven, but mostly shiny green patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail and some damage to the object.

882163,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1250,-750,"2018 T111; Undergoing Valuation



Description: A Late Bronze Age gold penannular ring, dating to the period 1150-750 BC. It measures 16.02mm in diameter at its widest point and 14.67mm at its most narrow, making it slightly oval. It is 4.59mm thick and weighs 4.72g. It narrows towards the terminals to 3.95mm. The gap between the terminals measures 1.9mm.



Discussion and Date: The Penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Egan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange' (Mark Lodwick and Mary Davis in record NMGW-04216C; references therein). Similar examples to this object are found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database including: DUR-EC189D, HAMP-F7B741, YORYM-0DD2F7.



Consequently, in terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal, it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

The fragment comprises a small portion of the blade and the tang. The blade is missing its tip but is lentoidal in section. The edges of the blade are either missing or heavily corroded. The tang extends from the blade and is approximately trapezoidal in plan. The remains of a hemispherical section rib are visible on both the upper and lower surfaces of the tang. The fragment measures 49mm in length, a maximum of 25mm in width and a maximum of 7mm in thickness.



Two small fragments of copper-alloy waste/slag were found at the same findspot. They measure:



a) 22mm in length, 16mm in width, 8mm in thickness and weighing 7.4g.

The dagger is similar to BH-2DF409 and LANCUM-EDDE97 which both date from 1300 to 1150BC. This fragment with its pronounced midrib resembles both daggers and might therefore belong to the Penard phase, too, dating to the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age 1300-1150 BC.

The axe has a broad head, tapering to a narrow butt. There is no evidence of flanges or ridges along the sides of either face but it is heavily corroded. This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe appears to be undecorated. The length is 77mm, width 37mm, thickness 10mm, and the weight 25.54g.

The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.

884168,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"An incomplete socketed copper alloy spear head dating from the Middle Bronze Age, about 1550 - 1250 BC. It probably can be assigned to Davis's Group 6 'Developed side looped' type (Davis 2017). It has a narrow blade measuring 45 mm in length. The tip is missing and the break is very worn and patinated suggesting it broke in antiquity. Only circa 12-15 mm of the tip appears to be missing. The blade wings are highly abraded and irregular, though much of this appears to have occurred post-deposition since the breaks are a different patina to the rest of the object. A maximum width of 7mm remains of the the blade wings. There is a hollow cylindrical socket at the blade base. The base of the socket is incomplete, and no side loops are visible.



The total length of the spearhead is 66 mm and the maximum width (from blade wing to wing) is 21 mm. The maximum thickness is 14 mm. The diameter of the socket at the base is 14 mm. The spearhead weighs 23.82g.



Davis (2017) notes that ""Spearheads from the earlier MBA were those with sockets extending into the blade, and with loops on the side of the socket. They date to the Acton Park and Taunton phases, 1550-1250 BC.""

The axe has expanding, straight sides, curving into the cutting edge. At this point there is a slight imitative stop ridge on both faces. The flanges are low (c.1mm high), extending from below the butt end and tapering out as the sides curve into the cutting edge. The butt end is narrow and thin (6.3x0.9mm) with a slight convex curve and possibly a small area of damage at one corner. The cutting edge has a more pronounced curve, is 14.8mm wide and 0.8mm thick at the very edge. In profile, the object is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval. The max. thickness is at the centre of the object, where it is 3.8mm thick. The sides expand to 10.7mm before curving into the cutting edge. There are vertical scratch marks along the body of the axe on both faces.

The object measures 49.2mm in length, 14.8mm in max.width, 3.8mm in max.thickness and weighs 7.91g.



This object is clearly modelled on the low-flanged axe, characteristic of the Arreton Park metalwork assemblage. Arreton types date to metalworking stage VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 4 circa 1750-1550 BC. It is uncertain whether this is a miniature axe intended for use (it seems rather small for axe-purpose) or perhaps had use as a votive object; it is larger though in its miniature form similar to miniature socketed axes (for eg.HAMP-657353) thought to have an amulet or votive function and believed to date between the Bronze Age to the Roman period (Robinson, P; 1995).",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,7.91,,,3.8,49.2,1,Jordan Gamble,Jordan Gamble,South East,Hampshire,Test Valley,Nether Wallop,SU3238,Generated from computer mapping software,51.14037943,-1.54397191,HAMP-B3BE22,,HAMPB3BE22.jpg,Bronze Age - Roman miniature object,Hampshire Cultural Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPB3BE22.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/647169.jpg

The awl tapers in plan from the rounded spatulated end which is 14.6 mm wide, and sub-rectangular in section, to the pointed end which is 3 mm wide and circular in section. The awl is heavily patinated and has taken a lot of damage around the nib leaving it distorted and with several deep cuts across its surface. Some awls may have been hafted in to a wooden or bone handle and this flattened butt end may have made for better hafting. Plain copper-alloy awls are hard to date precisely, but ones of this form are known to have been introduced in the Bronze Age with most being later Middle to Late Bronze Age in date c.1150-800 BC. The form changes little throughout time, however, and post-Bronze Age examples are also known.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a similar awl with a chisel-like opposite end from Tarrant Rushton in Dorset on page 103, pl.30, no.314, recorded in DOR-6DF7F6 and dated from the Middle to Late Bronze Age, c.1500-800 BC.



Similar examples have been recorded on the PAS database, including SF-333182 from Suffolk, SWYOR-55A4B7 from Yorkshire, and WILT-97977D from Wiltshire.","From the PAS website: (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/awl) Awls are difficult to date but most copper alloy examples are probably from the Late Bronze Age. They can have circular or square cross sections and are generally undecorated. They would have been used to make holes in leather or wood and many were probably were inserted into a handle made from organic materials. Awls were a range of rod-like tools that were usually round sectioned and pointed at one end, and rectangular sectioned with a square or chiselled edge at the other (Rowlands 1976 48). 'Awl' is often used to refer to any number of small, pointed instruments.

The axe-chisel is near-complete but is heavily corroded with some damage to the blade and butt and is comparatively small (with a length of 46.7mm and a weight of 22.0g). The butt is straight and flat with a little damage (12mm wide and 2mm thick). The sides are near-straight and divergent for the entire length of the axe-chisel, reaching the maximum width at the blade (of 26.4mm and with a thickness of 1.5mm). Much of the original blade edge is lost, which is of curved form but was not recurved. Both faces are very gently convex across their lengths but reach a maximum thickness (of 5.7mm) approximately one-third of its length from the butt (15mm from the butt) and is near-flat across their widths. There is no discernible median bevel or blade facets, although the blade faces converge more sharply (beginning 9mm from the blade edge). The side has a lenticular profile and there are no 'developed' features evident on the axe-chisel. The original surface has nearly all been lost with small remnant patches evident on both faces with a mid-green patina, elsewhere the pitted surface has corroded bright-green to green brown.","Early Bronze Age axe-chisel implements are difficult to relate to established axe typologies with any confidence. This example has no 'developed' features, perhaps indicating an early date of the bronze implements from the Early Bronze Age but also possibly because of a restricted casting technology and limited subsequent working. It could be suggested that the axe displays features more similar to Needham's Type 2 axes with a lenticular profile, comparatively wide butt and straight sides (perhaps 2C /D), although visual examination suggests a bronze rather than copper metallurgy. It is possible to suggest therefore that the axe may belong to Metalworking Assemblage III, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 2 -3 and probably dating to c. 2,200 - 1,900BC.",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,22,,,2,46.7,1,Mark Lodwick,Eirini Anagnostou,West Midlands,County of Herefordshire,County of Herefordshire,Longtown,SO3430,GPS (from the finder),51.96454255,-2.9620237,NMGW-0670CA,,201619.jpg,Early Bronze Age bronze flat axe-chisel,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/eanagnostou/201619.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/646959.jpg

The socketed axe is complete (with a length of 100.6mm and a weight of 277.1g). The top of the mouth is flat (with external dimensions of 54.5mm x 41.7mm and internal dimensions of 33.6mm x 27.8mm) and the remnants of the four casting stubs are evident, positioned near the inner edge of the mouth. The socket is sub-rectangular and appears to retain some sediment (at a depth of 66mm). Beneath the mouth the collar is short (7mm - 8mm) and bevelled to the faces, somewhat rounded in areas. The arched loop (37mm long 12mm high externally and 16.9mm x 6.5mm internally) springs from the base of the collar moulding and is of D-shaped section (5mm wide and 4mm thick). The sides are near-straight, very gently concave (with a minimum body width of 41.7mm) before diverging a little more sharply at the blade. The casting seam is evident on both faces and is now corroded but was raised and carefully finished. The sides are bevelled towards the seam, producing a sub-hexagonal body profile. The blade edge has a slight expansion (with a blade width of 48.0mm) and is moderately rounded. Both faces are straight along their lengths before a subtle but discernible blade facet (27mm from the blade edge) and have a slight convexity across their widths. Both faces are decorated with three ribs, which are near-parallel on one face but convergent on the other. The ribs (52mm - 61mm long) descend from the collar moulding and end before the blade facet. Much of the surface has been lost on the blade but a fragment of original surface survives showing sharpening striations running along the blade.

The cutting edge is heavily abraded, as is the surface of the blade so not sure whether it is symmetrical or asymmetrical through use. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. There are no traces of a casting seam but this may be due to corrosion.



The palstave, on both faces, has a prominent straight stop-ridge which is rectangular in plan. There are no hollows or ribs before the stop-ridge. The flange sides are a sub oval in profile with a flattened surface along the centre which was probably due to the removal of a casting seam.



In plan the septrum is rectangular and the butt has an abraded edge. The flange tops lean inwards over the septrum forming a convex exterior surface of the flange. 



The palstave has a well-developed brown patina which is incomplete and abraded.

Description: The chisel has a wide flat crescent shaped blade at the end of a long cylindrical body. The blade heavily abraded. The socket end has an oval aperture 10.57mm by 7.97mm. Each edge has a pair of opposed diagonal lines incised on them, creating a feathered decorative affect.

Stuart Needham, having examined a photograph of another Norfolk example (NMS-477E93), commented: ""It is interesting to learn of yet another of these arrowheads from British soil. Many years ago I would have ]...[ suspected a collector's loss. However, there are now sufficient (as well as the one secure context in the Penard hoard, Glamorgan) to suggest some currency of the type in this country. Despite the morphological similarity to flint versions, they by no means have to be Early Bronze Age. Bronze barbed-and-tanged arrowheads in one guise or another continue right through and my suspicion would be that most finds are Middle to Late BA. The Penard example proved to have an unusual metal composition suggestive of it being a foreigner.""

The butt is trapezoid in form with shoulders that curve inwards to the narrow blade. Two rivet holes to the bottom of either side would secure the hilt in place, both of which still retains its rivet; the rivet is 11.5mm long with a 7.4mm diameter and has a slightly expanded domed head at either terminal. The sides of the blade are straight and gradually taper to the point, running down the length of the blade on both sides is a very low central spine.

888599,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1550,-1250,"A nearly complete cast copper-alloy socketed side-looped spearhead of early Middle Bronze Age date, c. 1550-1250BC. Acton Park I-II Type, (Needham Period 5) - Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. Davis Group 5, wide blade side looped.



The spearhead comprises a leaf shaped blade with chamfered edges and a conical socket with protruding, semi-circular side loops; one to either side of the socket which are positioned in line with the cutting edge of the blade. A protruding mid-rib is present to both surfaces of the blade where the socket tapers to the tip. The edges of the blade are worn with a small semi-circular break to the lower curved edge of one side. Slight casting flashes are visible to either side of the loop though have been removed and smoothed down along the socket. Two small worn circular perforations are present on the socket, one to either side midway between the blade and loops. It is possible that the spearhead's stability has been reinforced with the addition of pegholes. Pegged varieties were not exclusive to the Late Bronze Age; as Davis (2017) notes in discussing the early socketed groups, some 'may have peg holes'. A slight bend in the blade is present which may be the result of purposeful decommissioning of the object though may also be a result of depositional processes.



The metal has a dark brown patina, delaminated with powdery green patches in places. The spearhead is 125.2mm long; the blade is 36.8mm x 4.3mm; the socket is 22.1mm in diameter, 2.7mm thick, 73.4mm depth. The object weighs 89g.



Side-looped spearheads correspond to Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV which date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC.

The blade tapers in thickness to the edge with no edge bevel. The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow, squared butt end. The flanges start a short way in from the butt corners and form a pointed oval shape in profile with the crest of the flange being the widest point. The exterior surfaces of the flanges are slightly concaved and no casting lines are visible. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body. There is no obvious stop ridge for the handle to butt against although there is a not very pronounced curved stop on the main body just above the lower end of the wings. The blade is thicker than the septum and tapers in thickness to the crescent shaped blade with no edge bevel. The edge of the blade is slightly chipped on one side.



The axehead is undecorated and the metal has a brownish-green patina, with bronze showing in patches, on some edges and the blade.



It is 110.5mm long, 44.2mm wide at the blade, 18.9mm wide at the butt end, 35.1mm thick at flanges and 13.67mm at the middle and weighs 197g.

In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than having cast flanges. The flanges extend 1.0 mm above the body of the axe head. The expanded blade measures 39.6mm in width and is 2.5 mm thick at the break.



The axehead measures 85.4mm in length, has a maximum width of 39.6mm (blade), a minimum width 21.8mm (butt), and has a width of 28.3mm in the centre. It is 10.8mm thick at the central point. It weighs 118.1g



The axehead is green, with a corroded and pitted surface.



This axehead is similar to those WMID-F20D62 and is consistent with that of the Arreton type axe, of Early Bronze Age III dating, metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.

892106,Chisel,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy flanged chisel of Middle Bronze Age date.



Description: It has a long rectangular blade original tapering to a curved splayed cutting edge. The blade however is broken bfore this point and is very worn. The butt end is flat and rectangular in form with prominent flanges to either side and transverse stop ridges on both front and back faces. Although this butt end is snapped a short way along the flanges and remains roughly jagged. Beneath the stop ridges the front and back faces have moulded shield-shaped decorative elements shown in counter-relief. No clear casting seam is visible down either side although this maybe due to the haeavy verdi gris corrosion. The one part of the edge visible appears to indicate some level of finishing. The surface of the chisel is heavily pitted in across much of its surface with a heavily verdigris presence. There is also substantial ware and the breaks are ragged.



Measurements: 114.63mm long, 20.72mm wide at the stop ridge, 15.22mm thick (at the flanges, 5.43mm thick at thinnest) and 115.55g in weight.



Discussion: This is a flanged chisel of Middle Bronze Age date. Similar examples are noted by Rowlands (1976: pp. 44-45, form iii, pl. 34 no. 1132), who notes that flanged chisels with shield shaped mouldings have a typological relationship with flanged axes and palstaves and are particularly concentrated in East Anglia ( a number of recent discovereies of palstaves with shield shaped mouldings in Kent may indicate a SW North-Sea zone for these types), as well as northern France. This dates the chisel to the Middle Bronze Age, c.1500-1150 BC. A more complete example from suffolk can be seen at SF-09D1D5.



Peter Reavill, FLO for Shropshire and Herefordshire comments further that ""this form of relative rare flanged (palstave-like) chisel are most probably aligned with the middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA II) c. 1500-1300 BC. The overall form of these chisels is very similar to the early palstaves albeit being much more slender. If this arguement is taken then they are probably contemporary to the primary phase palstaves, Group I which has a shield shaped or trident decoration directly below the fused stop ridge on the upper part of the blade. Theses palstave axe fits best with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess's Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. Although the construction / casting date fits within this period - it is highly probable that such specific and useful tools had a long life and so their deposition could potentially be many generations after casting (i.e. deposited in the period 1000-800 BC)"".",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,115.55,,,15.22,114.63,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Canterbury,Littlebourne,TR2058,GPS (from the finder),51.27864492,1.15305937,KENT-D5F626,,KENTD5F626.jpg,bronze age flanged chisel,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTD5F626.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1004628.jpg

It has an expanded lenticular profile with faint traces of filed down longitudinal casting seams. The butt is slightly concave, possibly as a result of post-depositional damage. It exhibits a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The transverse stop ridge expands on both faces and forms the widest point of the palstave. Below, on both faces is a vertical rib which extends to the central point of the upper cutting edge. The blade has expanding sides and a convex cutting edge, now heavily worn. 



The palstave has a mottled dark grey patina largely obscured by green corrosion product and pitting. 



Early Midribbed Palstaves belongs to the Acton Park Phase II of the Middle Bronze Age, corresponding to the earlier part of Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to 1500 - 1150BC. This example is similar to Group II - Early Midribbed Type Chepstow; similar to an example from Kilnoterie, Scotland (p127 cat no 794 plate 58, No. 789).

892715,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1250,"A complete copper-alloy early phase palstave dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500-1300 BC): The blade of the palstave is sub-trapezoidal in plan with slightly concave sides, flared blade tips, and no side loop. The cutting edge is slightly abraded on one edge although this appears to cut through the patina suggesting post-depositional damage. The sides of the blade are concave in plan, and this curvature stops at the junction of the blade and flange side. In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. The stop ridge has a small hole before it on one side, a probable casting flaw. There is a slight midrib down the centre of the blade on either side.



This palstave is particualrly similar to examples illustrated by Rowlands (1976: plate 29) all categoristed as his type 2 (side flanged) form dating to c. 1400-1150 cal BC.

It exhibits a narrow butt (23mm in width, 3mm in thickness). The body is slender and expands along its length to a width of 51.8mm. The sides exhibit high, inward-curved flanges forming a lenticular profile (maximum thickness 20.5mm, tapering to 12.5mm at the top of the blade). Most of the surface is now heavily corroded and pitted, however, one flage retains traces of decoration in the form of a series of punched chevrons. It is probable that this decoration originally covered the extent of both flanges.



The blade expands obliquely from either side of the axehead at the point the flanges terminate, forming a crescentic cuttring edge (width: 97.5mm). This has been somewhat aberaded and is now obscured somewhat by corrosion product.



It has a curved bevel or ridge about halfway down the septum (c.52mm from the butt), which is marginally lower than the flanges, but indicates the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. This is clearer on the better preserved face of the axehead. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion.
