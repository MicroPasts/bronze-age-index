818758,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1100,"Copper alloy single looped palstave axe with high, protruding stopridge and well preserved side loop dating to the Mid Bronze Age 1300 to 1150BC possibly relating to the Silsden types generally dated to the Penard. The axe is complete, except for the broken side loop, and in good condition. The body of the palstave is narrow but splays down the blade eventually flaring at the blade edge which is wide. The blade has a heavily curved faceted/bevelled cutting edge which may well have been hammered. The butt is squared, tapering with narrow flanges on both sides. The broken side loop is adjacent to the stop ridge. The length is 183mm, the width of blade is 90mm, width of butt is 22mm thickness 40mm and the weight too heavy for scales. There is a median thin rib from the stop ridge to the blade facet that flares into a fan shape. Similar to NLM-EE77E7, LEIC-6799A2. Similar to Read (1995: p.3 fig 3) dated 1450 - 1250BC.



Type Silsden side-looped palstaves are commonly found in the northern Britain and are especially widespread in Yorkshire. The closest comparable hoard is the Silsden hoard, Yorkshire which also contained two palstaves. (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 616, no. 923-4). The two Type Silsden side-looped palstaves can be dated to the Penard (c. 1300-1150 BC) metalwork phase of the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 161). They are classified within the broader 'Late Palstave' type but are typologically close to 'Transitional Palstaves' such as Type Shelf (see Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 158-160).

820834,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. 



The side view of the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. The long edges on the sides are slightly bevelled, leaving a subtle rectangular central band at the apex and therefore forming a slightly bulging profile.



In cross section the body of the axe has a slight H-shape as the side edges of the axe have been raised by hand hammering to form slight flanges, and therefore forming a curved sloped to the base of the spetum. The depth between the height of the flanges and base of the centre of the spetum is 0.64mm. The flanges appear to have been cast and probably augmented by hammering. There is no decoration present and the casting flanges have been trimmed filled and hammered flat. 



On both faces of the axe there is a slight bump / rib / proto-stop ridge, measuring 46.43mm from the apex of the butt. There is a median bevel when the blade starts to taper from the body of the axe and it measure 80.46mm from the apex of the butt to the median bevel. The median bevel is visible on both faces and is angular. 



On one face the space between the bump/rib-stop and the median bevel there are slight hammer mark traces forming a subtly mottled surface. The other face has active corrosion and a corrosion product adhered to the surface so any hammer marks are not visible. 



The blade tip flares outwards from the body forming a concave hollow. The blade appears to be symmetrical. There is no obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge, although it does tapers giving a slightly blunt edge. 



The surface of the axe, with the exception of the corroded areas, has a well-developed, shiny mottled dark green to dark grey patina. When the surface is reflected in a good light there is a hint of a shiny fine grey glittery surface which is likely to be due to leaching of the alloys in the burial environment where the tin element is better preserved.



The axe measures 100.75mm in length, 58.89mm in width, 10.93mm thick and weighs163.1g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. 



This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-05-15T23:00:00Z,2016-08-15T23:00:00Z,,,163.1,,,10.93,100.75,1,Angie Bolton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Warwickshire,Stratford-on-Avon,Sambourne,SP0761,From finder,52.2471376,-1.89889148,WAW-2779F8,,WAW2779F8.jpg,"Bronze Age axe (profile, plan, profile and plan).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAW2779F8.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/595682.jpg

The mouth of the chape is lozenge in form; the long side of the aperture has a deep U-shaped notch in the centre and extended sides that that from two tapering upward projecting arms that would have ran parallel with the scabbard, one arm is truncated. A pronounced central rib runs down the length of both faces and ends at the base where there is an oval disc with chamfered sides. In the centre of the rib is a hole that passes from one side to the next and may have been a rivet hole to secure the chape onto the scabbard.

The sides of the blade are straight and gradually taper to the point, running down the length of the blade on both sides is a very low central spine. Post depositional corrosion has resulted in shallow notches being removed from the side of the blade and much of the edge of the butt, plus small patches of active bronze disease are present, but otherwise this item is in very good condition with a light green patina over most of the artefact.

Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There is a large rectangular rim and recess on one face which could potentially represent a socket that has been melted into the ingot, perhaps from a socketed knife. There are also two rivets that have not melted into the ingot and have cavities around them, and two cavities in the form of blades on the other side of the ingot, perhaps from the ends of chisels. The XRF data below in the notes field indicates this ingot is largely copper, which would add some doubt to the possibility of this ingot having been melted from other objects (Matt Knight pers comm). But perhaps these objects have separated away from the ingot and retained their shape because the copper alloy weapons and tools would melt at a higher temperature than the pure copper ingot and must have been added to the metal for the original ingot (Martin Page pers comm).There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

822061,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-950,-850,"Two fragments of a cast copper alloy sword, part of the hilt and part of the blade, which are not connected. The hilt is lozenge-shaped in plan and in section, broken between the hilt tang and its shoulders at one edge and between the shoulders and the beginning of the blade at the other edge. There is a raised and rounded mid-rib that rises about 3 mm above the surface of the hilt on both broken edges and averages about 12 mm in width, and a rivet hole that is half way along the angled outer edge and 3.5 mm in diameter. The blade is rectangular in plan and lozenge-shaped in section, with a raised but flattened mid-rib that rises about 2 mm above the surface of the blade on both sides and averages about 12 mm in width, between two raised longitudinal lines that are 5 mm in from the existing edges, where the blade starts to taper to its cutting edge on either side, now missing. Both cutting edges are worn and incomplete and the perpendicular edges to these are broken so that the original length of the blade is unknown as well as the position of this fragment along it, though it is likely between the hilt and the middle of the sword as this is where the blade tapers before expanding at the mid point. 



Corrosion across the breaks indicates this was done in antiquity and the breaks show signs of high porosity in the metal at a macroscopic level, which would have influenced the breakage. Additionally, there are indentations below the break on the midrib on both edges of the hilt fragment which appear to be consistent with the bronze patina and it is possible these represent chisel marks (Matt Knight pers comm). 



These fragments may be a result of the deliberate decomissioning of the sword into separate pieces before it was ritually destroyed, or it may have been broken up in order to melt it down and re-use the metal. The two broken edges of the blade look like they were subsequently trimmed in order to re-use the weapon as a tool such as a razor or scraper. One broken end of the blade has a central semi-circular notch that is 5 mm in diameter which may have been used to break the sword at this point or deliberately produced as part of a rivet hole for later hafting when the fragment was re-used.There are also indentations and hammer marks on the two fragments that suggests the intentional breaking up of the sword, and a 'V' shape cut into the edge of the blade that indicates collision with another sword edge, perhaps during sparring (Neil Burridge pers comm).



There are pitted areas of corrosion on the surface but there appears to be the original golden-coloured bronze surface still visible underneath, as though the sword may have been in waterlogged conditions before ending up in the field in which it was found.The lozenge-shaped section of the blade with a raised central mid-rib suggests that this is probably part of a sword from the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, c.950-850 BC.

Less than 25% of the socketed axehead is present, consisting of the base of the socket and the blade edge. The fragment is sub rectangular in shape, and triangular in cross section. The socket is rectangular in shape. Casting ridges are present along one of the sides. The blade edge is rounded and expands out at the sides. The blade edge is damaged.

Around 50% of the spearhead is present, in two joining fragments. Most of the spearhead and some of the blades are present, the rest is missing, presumed lost in antiquity.



The spearhead is broadly lentoid (diamond) in shape. The socket is incomplete.. The remains of the socket is circular, and extends through both fragments. The blades were probably originally triangular in shape, they taper inwards to the socket.



The larger fragment measures 71.4 mm in length, a maximum width of 33.5 mm, across the blades in the centre. It is 14.3 mm thick. The metal is 1.6 mm thick. The socket is 16.1 mm wide at the base, and 8.9 mm wide at the tip. The blades have a surviving width of 9.7 mm and are 2.9 mm thick. It weighs 34.6 g.



The smaller fragment measures 24.6 mm in length, 21.8 mm wide and 10.7 mm thick. The metal is 2.0 mm thick. The socket is 7.5 mm wide at the base, and 4.6 mm wide at the top. It weighs 7.6 g.



Together both fragments weigh 42.4 g.



The spearhead is a mid green colour, with an even surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



From the shape of the blades, it is possible that this spearhead fragment was a side looped and socketed type, such as HESH-CFC925 and HESH-C348E5. Peter Reavill comments on those records that: Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC). Two similar examples of the overall style of spearhead are illustrated in Savory: Guide Catalogue to the Bronze Age Collections ref: 230, Llanbeblig, Caern. and 337:2 Nantcwnlle, Cards. The later example was discovered in an excavation of a burial mound in association with a Pygmy Cup. The metal of this example has been analysed and found to be of Cemmaes metal dated to the period 1400-1200 BC.

The spearhead is broadly sub-triangular in plan and profile with an incomplete and abraded sub-oval or leaf-shaped blades. The hollow socket is near complete and is slightly chamfered at the base.. Two single cast 'string' side loops are present, one on either edge. The tip of the spearhead is complete however the side blades have been broken. The overall shape of the blade can be best described as being leaf-shaped. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering (tip to base) pointed midrib. This midrib expands to the socket of the spear. The central raised line of the mid-rib does not extend into the socket. The socket is roughly half the whole length of the spear. The cross section of the spear is lentoid and the socket is circular. There are no visible areas of cast or incised decoration on the spearhead. The casting seams have been filed or polished away. 



The spearhead measures 104.02mm length, has a maximum width (across base of socket) of 14 mm. The depth of the socket is 55 mm. The spearhead weighs 42.89 grams. The mouth of the socket has a diameter of 12.5mm and a thickness of 2 mm.



Similar looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions.

828309,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A length of gold strip or &lsquo;ribbon&rsquo;, with eight longitudinal lines incised or grooved into the gold on one side only. 

Condition: broken at either end with no signs of preformation or terminal (some examples previously discovered do feature these elements). The ends are broken and ragged and there are a number of tears and folds along the body of the strip.

Dimensions: 

Length: 32mm

Width: 9mm

Weight: 1.52g

Gold content: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip by the British Museum Scientific Research team indicated a surface composition of approximately 86-88% gold, 11-12% silver, the rest being copper (1-2%). See appended report. 

Discussion: Similar grooved, pierced gold ribbons are well known, examples include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5); 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97.

The incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and &#39;ribbons&#39; of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).","Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

The spearhead is in two conjoining pieces, broken accross the socket below the blades. The end of the socket is damaged and incomplete.The blades are outcurved at the base before tapering in to a narrow tip, forming a flame-shape. There is prominent midrib running between the blades and extending into the socket. The midrib is lozengiform in cross section as is the upper part of the socket.

830606,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (Bronze) flat axe of the Early Bronze Age period dating from  c. 2250 BC - 1900 BC.



The flat axe is broadly trapezoidal in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid (pointed oval), with slight tapering edges. In cross section the axe is lentoid. The axe is broken toward the butt of the axe, but more than three-quarters of the axe survives. The break is relatively jagged and uneven; however it has a similar patina to that of the rest of the axe - suggesting damage in antiquity. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the broken edge to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. There are a series of striations (incised lines / file marks) running across the width of the axe. These are likely to be a result of sharpening the cutting edge. It seems most probable that the axe was cast in an open mould. All the diagnostic elements of the axe are lost (such as shape of butt and hafting specifications). The condition of the axe is poor - the majority of the surface patina has been removed by laminating corrosion, which appears to be active. 



The axe measures 77.6 mm in length, it is 34.4 mm wide at the butt and the blade is 75.2 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 8.7 mm, the blade is 2.8 mm thick. It weighs 253.6 g.



The object is a dark brown in colour with an uneven patina. Areas of green active corrosion are present on the surface of the object. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of much of the original surface detail. From the blade shape (which could be described as fan-like) it is probable that the axe falls into the Migdale tradition of metalworking. This fits with the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC. Axes such as this are dated to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

830724,Dagger,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1150,"A copper-alloy dagger, possibly dating to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300 to 1150 BC). The dagger possesses a lentoidal-section tang which is rectangular in form and expands and flattens to form a rounded terminal. Extending from both the upper and lower surfaces of the tang are small, semi-circular projections measuring 14mm in length and 1mm in width. These projections would have helped secure a handle to the dagger. The tang expands to form the blade which is lentoidal in section and gently tapers to a point, now broken. It measures 180mm in length, the blade has a maximum width of 25mm and a thickness of 3mm. The tang has a width of 14mm.



The object was originally in two pieces and has been restored. It is difficult to fit this small dagger into existing typologies for Bronze Age weaponry and thus its identification must remain tentative. Dot Boughton comments 'that it might belong to the Penard phase, dating to the earliest phase of the Late Bronze Age 1300-1150 BC and be a Ballintober type. Most British Ballintober swords come from the Thames Valley and a small number was found in South West England and South Wales. Until a sword of this type was found near Stranraer (Galloway), the most northerly find came from the River Trent in Nottinghamshire.'",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,,,,3,180,1,Philippa Walton,Philippa Walton,South East,Buckinghamshire,Aylesbury Vale,Edlesborough,SP9719,Centred on parish,51.86116288,-0.59281369,BH-2DF409,,BH2DF409.jpg,Bronze Age dagger,All rights reserved,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/pwalton/BH2DF409.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/601618.jpg
831076,Spear,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A fragment of a copper alloy, side looped and socketed spear (spearhead) of probably the Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1500 - c. BC 1150.



The fragment would have made the tip of the spear. The object is broadly triangular in plan and lozenge (diamond shaped) in section. There is a raised rib running the length of the fragment on both the front and the reverse face. From the rib each side of the fragment slopes down towards the blade. The cutting edges of the blade are damaged and much of the edge is now missing, presumed lost in antiquity. The tip of the fragment is also damaged, probably as a result of post depositional damage whilst within the plough soil. 



The object measures 20.0 mm in length and is 18.8 mm wide at the base of the fragment and the tip is 4.8 mm wide. The tip has a thickness of 4.5 mm, the blade edge is 2.8 mm thick, and the base measures 15.6 mm thick. It weighs 5.8 g. 



The object is a dark green in colour and has an even patina. There is evidence of post depositional damage on the surface of the object in the form of pitting and indentations. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. 



Similar looped spearheads have been dated by Margaret Ehrenberg to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions (c. 1500 - 1150BC).

831393,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-1000,"The hoard consists of seven objects (two tools and five ornaments). Among the ornaments there are three annular decorated armrings/bracelets, one spiral coiled finger-ring and one short section from a spiral twisted torc, all made of copper alloy. Among the tools there is a palstave axehead and a socketed hammer, both also in copper alloy. No other details of the composition/arrangement of the hoard (or of any other objects) were recorded.



Catalogue: 



1. Bracelet/armring, annular, decorated (complete) ('Liss' type). 



A complete copper alloy bracelet/armring decorated probably by engraving/incision, with several panels of decoration separated by less complex 'dividing' patterns. Condition is generally very good and the bronze is golden in patches and green/corroded in other areas. The decoration is relatively deep and has been applied with some degree of care. There are guidelines visible at various locations on the body of the bracelet/armring, which presumably relate to the application of the decoration. \



The complex decoration is best appreciated by photographs and line-drawings but the arrangement is as follows:



Panel A: Elliptic nested motifs built up from combinations of three lines separated by a row of dots alongside semi-circular patterns with the same design logic. These are arranged approximately one atop the other [i.e. ')('].



A 'dividing' section of 10 lines (running vertically to the circumference of the bracelet-armring - please note, this is true of all other decorative elements described as 'lines' in the below description), a row of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern, five lines, a section of criss-cross decoration, seven lines.



Panel B: Is made up of a geometric pattern consisting of (filled and unfilled) chevrons on either side of a central bar that is made of line, dot and ladder motifs.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines.



Panel C: Is made up of nested chevrons, above and below which are panels that could only be appreciated from above rather than from the side view of the bracelet/armring. They consist of a line of dots with horizontal lines to both sides and a row of herringbone.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines, a section of criss-cross decoration, three lines, a lot of dots followed by three further lines.



A repetition of Panel B.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines.



Dimensions: External diameter: 88mm; Internal diameter: 59mm; Thickness of bar: (width) 15mm; (height) 18mm; Weight: 362g.



2. Bracelet/armring, annular, decorated (incomplete) ('Liss' type).



An incomplete copper alloy bracelet/armring (missing around a third of the original length). It is decorated probably by engraving/incision, with several panels of decoration separated by less complex 'dividing' patterns. The decoration is relatively deep and has been applied with some degree of care. Condition is generally very good and the bronze is golden in places but green/corroded in other areas.



The overall decorative scheme is very similar to bracelet/armring No. 1 and the same 'dividing' and 'panel' system used above can be applied:



Break in bracelet/armring that comes into a 'dividing' section of criss-cross decoration followed by three lines (running vertically to the circumference of the bracelet-armring - please note, this is true of all other decorative elements described as 'lines' in the below description), a line of dots followed by three further lines.



Panel B.



A 'dividing' section of three lines, a line of dots followed by three further lines



Panel A.



A 'dividing' section of five lines, a row of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern, four lines, a section of criss-cross decoration, five lines, a row of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern, five lines.



A repetition of Panel B which breaks off due to the missing section.



Dimensions: External diameter: 88mm; Internal diameter: 59mm; Thickness of bar: (width) 13-14mm; (height) 18mm; Weight: 257g.



3. Bracelet/armring, annular, decorated (complete) ('Liss' type). 



A complete copper alloy bracelet/armring decorated probably by engraving/incision. The decoration is simpler than bracelet/armrings Nos. 1-2 and it weighs less than the complete example (No. 1). It comprises of four panels carrying the same motif: tightly nested/stacked herringbone that face a mirror image of the same motif, creating this effect: '>><<'. The panels are separated by diving sections made up of lines that run vertically to the circumference of the bracelet/armring. There are four of these dividing sections. The number of the lines in each is not always identical (there are 12, 15, 16, and 16 respectively).



Dimensions: External diameter: 88mm; Internal diameter: 61mm; Thickness of bar: (width) 13mm; (height) 15mm; Weight: 295g.



4. Spiral finger ring. Made from a single bar of copper alloy that has been spiralled into two complete loops and two half loops at the top and bottom, where the terminals are forged down neatly, presumably to prevent them from catching/snagging. Small hammer marks are visible on the external surfaces. The condition is generally very good with patches of golden bronze mixed with green patches of corrosion.



Dimensions: Height (of spiralled stack): 22m; Diameter: 29-31mm; Thickness of bar used to make ring: 6mm; Height of bar used to make ring: 8mm; Weight: 56g



5. Spiral twisted torc fragment. A fragment of a copper alloy spiral twisted torc with old breaks at either end that appear to have been made in antiquity. The fragment still has soil adhering to the surfaces but it is possible to see that the metal has been twisted from a bar rather than cast to appear twisted.



Dimensions: Length (measured with a soft tape): 60mm; Thickness: 5.5mm; Weight: 9g.



6. Socketed hammer. A copper alloy socketed hammer. Condition is generally good, with patches of golden bronze and other areas of green corrosion. There is evidence of wear to the hammer's surface and sides. There is a small casting flaw near the collar: a small perforation that would not have interfered with the function.



Dimensions: Length: 70mm; Hammer's striking surface dimensions: (height) 26mm; (width) 15mm; Socket dimensions: (height) 25mm; (width) 22mm; collar thickness: 4mm; Weight: 148g.



7. Palstave axehead. An unlooped copper alloy palstave with central mid-rib and unpronounced stop-ridge. The palstave is best placed in Rowland's Class 3 (1976, 32-3). There are features in common with his Class 4 (the lack of pronounced stop-ridge) but this is not sufficiently strong to place it in that class, although some degree of hybridisation may have taken place.



Dimensions: Length: 143mm; Blade width: 60mm; Butt width: 20mm; Width of flanges: 30mm; Weight: 332g.



Discussion:



The finds catalogued above form part of a Taunton Assemblage hoard (c.1400-1250 BC). Several ornament hoards of Taunton phase have been found in Hampshire to date (see Roberts 2007; Wilkin 2016, 42-3, App. 2.1 and Treasure Case 2016 T940) and, more broadly, across Southern England (Ibid., in passim). The condition of the objects, and the presence of three decorated annular bracelet/armrings, two of which are decorated to a very high standard with complex motifs, makes this an important addition to the corpus of ornament hoards. The decoration of the three decorated bracelets/armrings deserves further study/commentary but for now it may be noted that the motifs are consistent with those from other known examples, several of which are from Hampshire (cf. Rowlands 1971).","As a single find of more than two objects of prehistoric date, the objects catalogued above (Nos. 1-7) constitute a find of Treasure as stipulated by the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).

It is sub lozengiform in cross section, the blade narrowing from c19.90mm to 17.05mm at the break. There is no evidence, in this length of blade, of a curve or serration, other than some wear to both edges. At the point of the break, the flat of blade appears to be curling upwards but this might have occurred at the same time as the break rather than being part of the original design.

833749,Jewellery,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-800,"A rolled-up strip of gold of probable Chalcolithic or Bronze Age date (c. 2500-800 BC). The strip of gold is sub-rectangular in plan, and is rolled up (width ways), forming a tight roll which has been slightly squashed into an oval shape (when viewed from the side). Eleven folds can be counted from the middle. There is some soil still attached to and within these folds. The strip is very thin (less than a diameter). The strip is wider in the middle than near the end, where it tapers from c. 21 mm in the middle towards 15 mm at the end (the end hidden in the folds in the centre of the bundle is also narrower than the middle). It becomes even narrower towards the very end, but how narrow cannot be assessed as the tapering end has been folded over backwards twice so that the very end of the strip is hidden between the first fold. The outer surface of the strip that can be seen (the rest being hidden between the folds) is undecorated, and has a pitted, uneven and slightly creased surface. There are also several small probable post-depositional scratches on the outer surface of the roll. A small cut or break is visible on the edge of the strip in the second and eighth fold, but they do not appear to extend across the entire width of the strip.



Measurements: The rolled-up gold strip has a maximum height of 21 mm, a maximum width of 15 mm and a breadth of 12 mm. It weighs 15.09 g (including soil).



Metal content: Analysis of the gold at the British Museum demonstrated that the object was 95-96% gold and has a composition consistent with a Bronze Age date.



Discussion: This object would have been a long, narrow thin strip of gold tapering towards the ends. Unfortunately, due to its rolled-up condition, the ends in the strip described here cannot be seen, so any possible perforations, if present, are not visible. Unlike several other gold strips of Bronze Age date (e.g. WMID-FE3C28, NMGW-39F32D no. 1, KENT-D13625, BERK-BA8440, HAMP-36C41B, PAS-067AC5), this strip does not seem to have been decorated. Such plain gold strips without any archaeological context present problems for dating. They are relatively undiagnostic examples of Bronze Age goldwork in Southern England (c.2500-800 BC) and parallels are hard to find (cf. Murgia et al. 2014). However, there are a few similar objects. In France there is an example of a plain tapered strip of gold from the Saint-Babel hoard. It was rolled up in a very similar way as the strip discussed here (Eluère 1982, 114, pl. 137). However this strip or bracelet is a lot thicker and shorter than the strip discussed here. Another plain strip of gold with a tapered end and two small perforations was found in an Early Bronze Age Breton hoard, but unfortunately this piece is incomplete so its length cannot be assessed (Eluère 1982, 57 pl. 68). Another object in continental Europe which is similar to the strip described here is illustrated and described as a diadem by Perea (1991, 50); it comes from a Chalcolithic collective tomb at Cueva de los Murciélagos, Granada, in the south of Spain. However, the object is a lot wider in the middle than the strip described here. In Ireland a plain gold strip with rounded, tapered ends was found in Co Cavan (Taylor 1980, pl. 28 g,h & i), but this strip was decorated and only 285 mm long.



In the UK there also are a few parallels for this object. CORN-8EC344 for instance, is a plain gold strip with tapered, rounded ends that have been folded over. There are punch holes inside these folded terminals which may have held a nail. Another plain gold band (or 'ribbon') folded over on itself to create four layers was found in West Mersea Essex (ESS-9D1D4A) and this only had one perforated terminal. A similar possible Bronze Age plain gold band or 'ribbon' was found in Dorset (DOR-52C762). This band is broken at one end and the other tapers to an unperforated terminal. A plain gold strip from the Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-09A1A5), with perforated and folded terminals, is dated from the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1300 BC) (Portable Antiquities and Treasure Annual Report 2008 273, no.24, 42). A hoard from Capel Isaf, Manordeilo, Carmarthenshire had two items that may be comparable; a gold securing strip with perforated folded terminals from a gold armlet or cuff, and incomplete crushed gold armlet formed of a plain strip with tapered terminals (Savory 1980, 125, 195, fig.47, nos. 1 and 4). This hoard is dated to the Middle Bronze Age c.1600-1400 BC (bid. 125).



However, the closest parallels for this rolled-up gold strip are two possible diadems or neck-chokers. The first of these was found near Winchester in Hampshire (HAMP-AEA895). This is a long, cigar shaped strip of sheet gold with tapered ends. Both ends have three small perforations set in a triangle. The transverse creases in this strip (which was unrolled) are consistent with it having been rolled up and crushed flat, in a very similar way as the object described here. This deliberate destructive treatment (folding, rolling, damaging) is fairly common in Bronze Age objects that are deposited as part of a hoard. The second 'diadem' comes from Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire (WAW-FF1E9A). It is broken into two pieces, but they appear to have formed a long slender sheet of gold with tapering ends. Both ends have three small perforations. Unlike the first example, the edge of this sheet is decorated with a border of fine pointille decoration and although the sheet was crumpled, it was not folded.



Based in the available parallels, the rolled-up gold strip can be assigned to the Bronze Age and deserves further research.","In terms of age and precious metal content, the object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",4,Gold,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,2016T187,,15.09,21,,,,1,Neil Wilkin,Ian Richardson,Eastern,Essex,Chelmsford,Little Baddow,TL7808,From finder,51.74242844,0.576797,PAS-6DBE56,,2016T187a.JPG,Bronze Age gold strip,The British Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2016T187a.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/604283.jpg
833840,Mould,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A copper alloy Middle Bronze Age palstave mould formed of two interlocking halves (i.e. bivalve) was found on the 25th of February 2017. No other objects or details of the find context were reported. The two halves (valves) of the palstave mould are described separately below and have been labelled and referred to as 'Part A' and 'Part B' throughout.



Description: 



Soil still adheres to both parts of the bivalve mould (especially to 'Part B') but X-radiography has assisted in description of both parts.



Valve (Part A) 



A valve for a Middle Bronze Age palstave with semi-circular pouring/sprue cup (see Fig. 1). The internal surfaces are well finished (although soil still adheres). Three small rounded tendons (semi-circular in cross section) are raised c.2-3mm above the surface of the mould and are designed to interlock with the negative impressions (sockets) found on Part B (see below). There are two tendons on either side of the stop ridge and the third is located at the blade edge of the valve, approximately midway along the length of the blade. There is a relatively deep mid-rib in the centre of the blade (c.4-5mm) and some scoring to the septum surfaces (see Fig. 1).



On the exterior surface of the mould there are two small circular protrusions (or 'pellets') located at the blade end of the valve, approximately level with the corners of the palstave's cutting blade (see Fig. 2). There is an area of white speckled patina extending around the centre of the mould and in one or two isolated patches on the corner of the valve and at the pouring sprue end.



Within the soil from the valve were three small heavily corroded pellets of ?copper alloy (now bagged and stored separately), more work is required to analyse and understand these inclusions. Other, similar fragments can be seen in the soil that still adheres to the interior surface of the valve.



Damage: A crack runs through the valve and is most noticeable on the exterior surface of the valve. It is 60mm in length and widens towards the blade end of the mould (where it reaches a maximum width of c.1mm). This crack is likely to be ancient. Other fissures can be seen in the septum (running perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the palstave impression) and can be seen on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the valve (compare Figs. 1 & 2). These cracks/fissures (and others) are identified in the X-Radiography images provided by Daniel O'Flynn (Scientist, The British Museum) (see Fig. 3 & 4). Radiography reveals that the crack on the blade edge extends to the mid-rib of the palstave mould impression.



Dimensions: Total length of valve: 212mm; Width of valve: 90mm (at the max. point of blade width); Width of valve (min.): 47mm; Width (at pouring cup terminal): 50.5mm; Height of pouring cup: 25mm; Length (pouring cup to stop-ridge): 77mm; Length (stop ridge to edge of blade): 104mm; Width (max. blade width): 70mm; Width (at stop ridge): 25mm; Weight: 1461g.



Valve (Part B) 



Description: A valve for a Middle Bronze Age palstave with semi-circular pouring sprue/cup. The pouring sprue/cup end of valve is eroded/worn, possibly through use prior to deposition. The interior surface of the valve has three corresponding sockets for the tendons of valve 'Part A' (see Fig. 1). There is a semi-circular indent in interior surface of the valve that has a depth of c.7mm. This may have function to enable the metalworker to separate the two valves easily following the casting process. Soil adheres to the surfaces of this valve more fully than Part A. But the X-Radiographic image demonstrates that the patterning is identical to Part A, as one would expect (Fig. 3-4). There are cracks running horizontally across the blade on either side of the valve. Radiography confirms that these do not meet. They are visible on the exterior and the interior surfaces of the mould.



The impression of the palstave has not been set as evenly within the valve, hence the distance between blade corners to edge of the mould is 10mm and 12mm in the case of 'Part A' but 6.5mm and 13mm in the case of 'Part B' (Fig. 1).



On the exterior surface the same white-speckled patina that features on the exterior of valve 'Part A' covers the middle section of the valve (Fig. 2). There is no equivalent to the pellets that are found on the corners of the exterior surface of 'Part A'.



Damage: Cracks can be seen through the blade, running through the mould but not extending across its full width. These cracks are likely to be ancient. X-Radiography (Fig. 4) reveals additional cracking within the septum of the palstave impression, running perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the palstave impression and extending from the mid-rib to the edge of the blade.



Dimensions: Are as 'Part A' with a slightly heavier weight (1482g), probably due to the adherence of soil. The palstave impression sits less evenly within the surface area of the mould (as noted above).



Discussion:



This is only the tenth Middle Bronze Age palstave mould found in Britain to date and only the fourth example of a mould used to produce unlooped palstaves (Adams & Webley 2016, Table 1; A. Gwilt pers comm.). It is the first to have been found in Oxfordshire, if we exclude the palstave-chisel from Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire (Adams & Webley 2016, no. 47). Other palstave moulds have been found in Southern England, including examples from London, Norfolk, Shropshire and Wiltshire.



The mould would have been used to cast broad bladed palstaves of Rowland's (1976, 32-3) Class 3, Group 1. The mould is most similar to that from Deansfield/Danesfield, Gwynedd, Bangor, Wales (Adams & Webley 2016, no. 20; British Museum Reg. 1849, 0521.5). That mould also has two tendons on either side of one valve and would have been used to produce similarly formed palstaves of Class 3, Group 1 (Rowlands 1976, 32-3).



Two factors may account for the abandonment and/or deposition of the bivalve mould. Firstly, the two valves fit relatively snuggly at the blade end of the bivalve (as one would expect for the bivalve to function effectively) but there is a bowing of both valves at the pouring sprue/cups ends (Fig. 5). This would lead to spillage and miscasting and would be very difficult to correct or stimmy. Similar bowing of copper alloy moulds has been noted on modern (experimental) examples and has resulted in the failure of the mould to cast successfully (N. Burridge pers comm.). Secondly, the large cracks across both fragments (see Figs. 3-4) would create potential for leakage and failure to cast palstaves of adequate form for use.



Please note: further conservation work and scientific research would be highly desirable given the relative rarity of this find.

Dimensions: Length: 14.5mm, width: 5.7mm, maximum thickness: 4.3mm, minimum thickness: 1.3mm, weight: 3.4g. 



Discussion: A number of similar objects have been reported as potential Treasure, individually and as components in hoards, and are recorded on the PAS database. They are most typically described as Bronze Age ingots, such as 2004 T416 (nos. 41, 48 & 49) & CORN-199400 (2005 T110).  Some are suggested to have been fragments of Bronze Age bracelets, including SUSS-23E3A5 (2004 T59) & IOW-BD19F8 (2007 T429). 



A small number of similar objects have also been recorded as unidentified in terms of both object type and date, including SF-2D6E28 (2008 T310) & KENT-C4CEE1 (2010 T439). 



Date: Although a firm date cannot be ascribed, the presence of similar examples as components in hoards is strongly indicative of a Middle to Late Bronze Age date, c. 1500 – 750 BC.",The object appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.,3,Gold,,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2017-02-13T00:00:00Z,2017-03-13T00:00:00Z,2017T252,,3.4,,,4.3,14.5,1,Julie Shoemark,Julie Shoemark,Eastern,Norfolk,King's Lynn and West Norfolk,Sedgeford,TF7035,GPS (from the finder),52.88558595,0.52516935,NMS-9533FB,,31814_9533FB_BA_Ingot.jpg,Bronze Age ingot,Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/pjh41/31814_9533FB_BA_Ingot.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1097036.jpg
837132,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-900,-700,"Late Bronze to early Iron Age (c. 900 to 700 BC) socketed axe: The axe has been cast from copper alloy and is complete. The mouth of the socket is almost a square, with rounded corners and convex sides. On two interior edges, opposite each other, there is a slight semi-circular moulded platform. The socket is 92.31mm deep and tapers in depth more than it tapers in width. The rim of the mouth is abraded and undulating because of the abrasion. The socketed mouth moulding on the exterior just has a single sub-triangular sectioned collar.



The sides of the axe have a slender casting seam, with the seam, on one face, curving over the integral loop. The loop s D-shaped with a sub-oval perforation which has traces of the casting seam within it. The faces of the axe are slightly narrower than the sides, causing the sides to be slightly faceted and rounded. The sides taper towards the blade edge



The axe faces appear to be flat and undecorated. There is surface abrasion and the faces have lost some of their patina. The edges of the faces have parallel sides and a splayed cutting edge. The blade tips are rounded and the cutting edge is abraded, very worn and is slightly convex. The cutting edge may have been sharpened extensively as the blade edge is quite thick and does not have the bevel you occasionally see. There is not decoration on the axe.



The axe measures 111.27mm long, 66.05mm wide across the blade tips, 40.08mm thick across the mouth moulding and weighs 324g. The socket mouth interior measurements are 27.82mm long and 27.49mm wide.



Dr Dot Boughton considers the axe to be transitional late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, therefore dated c. 900-700 BC and that it is a late chunky Ewart Park type with a square to sub-rectangular mouth.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-09-30T23:00:00Z,2017-01-12T00:00:00Z,,,324,,,40.08,111.27,1,Dot Boughton,Angie Bolton,West Midlands,Worcestershire,Wyre Forest,Rock,SO7370,From a paper map,52.32742301,-2.39760518,WAW-BA32B4,,WAWBA32B4.jpg,"Bronze Age socketed axe (plan, profile, plan, profile and terminals).",Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/WAWBA32B4.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/607236.jpg

A group of 11 bronze objects found through metal detecting in Tendring, Essex, found in the same area and therefore associated with the Tendring Hoard (2015 T590).



1) sword fragment. A fragment of a copper alloy sword blade. The fragment is from the blade, broken across the blade on both ends, resulting in a slight curved or s-shaped profile in section. The cross section shows a convex middle section which then thins towards each blade edge. The curved cross-section suggests that the fragment stems from the upper section of the blade, towards the hilt. Both blade edges are damaged along the length, meaning the original cutting edge is destroyed probably prior to deposition. There appears to be some modern damage to the surface, with deeper scratches and striations revealing a brighter patina.



Dimensions - length: 6.5cm, width: 3.15cm, thickness (max): 0.7cm, weight: 64.31g



2) copper alloy fragment.  An irregular fragment of copper alloy, which appears to have a flat surface as one face, whilst the others are irregular and uneven suggesting this is a piece of casting waste or part of a rough round-shaped ingot.



Dimensions - length (max): 4.6cm, width (max): 2.5cm, thickness (max): 1.7cm, weight: 49g.



3) copper alloy fragment.  A small fragment of copper alloy of irregular shape. There is one flat surface, with an opposite face which appears slightly rounded. The fragment has irregular breaks around all sides revealing an irregular surface. Along with fragment No.2, this could also be part of an ingot.



Dimensions - length (max): 2.2cm, width (max): 1.9cm, thickness: 1.4cm, weight: 19.61g.



4) fragment of a socketed and looped axehead.  Body fragment of a socketed and looped copper alloy axehead, consisting of one face from the socket to approximately half way down the body towards the blade. The fragment has irregular breaks along both sides, and the loop survives along with visible casting seams on both side faces. The break across the blade face is straight and linear, perpendicular to the direction of the axe. The socket has a prominent moulded rim, followed by a parallel moulded ridge c.1cm from the rim leading to an undecorated body. The loop survives intact and begins from the second moulded ridge. From the surviving fragment of the socket, it is possible to suggest that the socket would have been rounded or sub-square. The fragment is quite corroded but there are patches of the original patinaed surface, some of which show scratches.



Dimensions - Length (incomplete): 6cm, width (at socket): 3.6cm, loop length: 2cm, loop width: 0.85cm, weight: 117.11g.



5) fragment of a socketed axehead. A fragment of a copper alloy socketed axe. The fragment includes the narrow asymmetrical blade and most of the axe body, with an irregular break across the body. The visible socket is sub-rectangular in cross-section. The fragment is in good condition but the surface has suffered from corrosion. And the lack of diagnostic features remaining makes it difficult to identify a type.



Dimensions - axe length 6.7cm (incomplete), blade width: 3.9cm, width at break: 2cm, weight: 115.88g.



6) fragment of a socketed axehead.  A large body and blade fragment of a copper alloy socketed axehead, with an irregular break across the body of the axe. Casting seams are visible along each edge, and a number of scratches are visible on the surface in a variety of directions which are likely to a mixture of ancient and more recent damage. There is a clear scuffing of one edge which was probably caused during the recovery of the objects. The cross section of the interior is sub-rectangular, and the body runs straight before flaring into the rounded blade edge.



Dimensions - length (max): 6.9cm, blade width: 4.4cm, width (at break): 3cm, weight: 136.32g.



7) fragment of a socketed and looped axehead. A fragment of a copper alloy socketed and looped axehead, surviving from the base of the loop to half way down the body of the axe, both the socket rim portion and blade edge section are missing. The socket is sub-square in cross-section at the top break at the base of the loop, and widens to sub-rectangular at the second break across the blade body. The fragment comes from a narrow bodied axehead.



Dimensions - length: 4cm, width: 2.4cm (at loop), side width: 2.4cm (at loop), weight: 85.2g.



8) fragment of a socketed axehead.  A small fragment of a copper alloy socketed axehead, consisting of one face from the upper part of the blade. The surface appears to taper out slightly suggesting this fragment is from the middle section of the blade body. In section, the fragment is slightly curved suggesting it has been bent. On one side the casting seem is visible, and linear striations suggest to polishing or working of the axe once cast. All edges of the fragments are created by breaks, one appears to be straight whereas the break at the narrower of the tapered face, and those along the sides are irregular. There are no identifiable features surviving on this fragment.



Dimensions - length: 2.7cm, width (max): 2.8cm, width (min): 1.2cm, thickness:0.4cm, weight: 16.32g.



9) fragment of an axehead. A blade fragment of a copper alloy axehead. The fragment has a linear break across the body of the axe, running perpendicular to the direction of the axe body. The cutting edge is asymmetrical and damaged, although it is likely that the large chips have been removed post-deposition. There is evidence of recent damage on one face perhaps caused during the recovery of the artefacts. The blade is flared slightly, and the sides appear to be faceted leading up to the main portion of the blade body which is now missing. The break reveals a solid interior, with no signs of a socket visible.



Dimensions - length: 3.5cm, blade width: 4.3cm, side width (at break): 1.2cm, weight: 55.35g.



10) fragment of an axehead.  A blade fragment of a copper alloy axehead. The fragment has a linear break across the body, perpendicular to the direction of the blade. the blade edge is irregular through a mixture of ancient and more recent damage; however, the blade would have been asymmetrical prior to deposition.



Dimensions - blade width: 4.5cm, length: 3.2cm, width: 0.8cm, weight: 53.35g.



11) copper alloy artefact.  A small cylindrical piece of possible copper alloy, although the red/brown colour of the surface suggests some surface erosion. The object is cylindrical, and appears to have linear casting seams or ridges along each side. Both ends are rounded.



Dimensions = length: 3.7cm, width: 1.4cm, thickness: 0.95, weight: 22.63g.



Discussion/ identification



No. 1 is identifiable as a sword fragment from the upper part of the blade body. Due to the convex-concave cross-section it is possible to suggest that the fragment comes from a leaf-shaped sword, however a definite identification is impossible due to the significant percentage of the sword which is missing. Due to its association with socketed ace fragments in this group of objects, it could be argued that the fragment comes from a Ewart Park type sword (see Burgess and Colquhoun 1988:66).



Fragments Nos.2 & 3 are irregular and do not resemble any recognisable artefact. The flat surface that each fragment has could suggest they are part of a copper alloy/bronze ingot.



Due to the double rib moulding at the socket, axe fragment No.4 can be loosely categorised as belonging to the South-Eastern type (Schmidt and Burgess 1981:212, Plate 85). South-Eastern axes are characterised by a 'fairly slender, square to rectangular sectioned body with a squarish mouth' (ibid). Axe fragments Nos. 5-8 lack any clear features by which they can be identified, and so they cannot be categorised beyond belonging to socketed axes.



The blade fragments, Nos. 9-10, are likely to belong to a socketed axe due to the presence of other socketed fragments in this assemblage. Because the break is close to the blade tip, the interior is solid in both these fragments and whilst it is more likely that the break occurred below the limit of the socket, these fragments cannot be definitely identified as socketed axeheads or tools.



No.11 is an irregular cylindrical object which is not identifiable as a clear artefact type, however its shape and the presence of casting seams or ridges show that it was a deliberately cast object. Although not diagnostic, a prehistoric date is at least possible.



This assemblage was found by the same finder and in the same location as the Tendring Hoard (2015 T590) and is arguably part of the same hoard of material. The 2015 T590 assemblage included complete and incomplete socketed axes, as well as sword fragments and ingots, therefore the character of the collection described above is similar to the original assemblage discovered. Although this assemblage does not include some of the identifiable socketed axe types which the main hoard did (notably the Yorkshire Type axeheads), the fragmented axes and the broken probable South-Eastern type (No.4), are comparable to a large group of fragmented axes found in T90. The report for 2015 T590 concludes that the hoard belongs to the Later Bronze Age, and the later part of the Ewart Park Phase (c.950-800 BC), although it was noted that the presence of later artefacts within the original assemblage suggested it dated from the transitional period between the Bronze and Iron Age.

Discussion: The hoard appears to date to the Ewart Park Phase of the Late Bronze Age (950 BC-800 BC), and due to the nature of the material is likely to be a scrap metal deposit. As more than one prehistoric base metal object was found in association with one another, based on material and date they constitute a hoard under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996-2002 Treasure designation order. They therefore will qualify as Treasure.","Due to the association of the objects (Nos. 1-11) as a discrete group and because they belonged as part of a larger hoard (addenda to 2015 T590), they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996) (Designation Order 2002).",3,Copper alloy,,Submitted for consideration as Treasure,Metal detector,,,2016T923,,,,,,,11,Elisha Mason,Sophie Flynn,Eastern,Essex,Tendring,Tendring,TM1323,,51.86489992,1.09222569,ESS-D132C4,,2016T923a.jpg,Sword fragment,The British Museum,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ianr/2016T923a.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1028285.jpg
840547,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1875,-1725,"A complete flat axehead with a crescentic blade, of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 1875 BC to c. 1725 BC).



The axehead has a rectangular shape, with a crescentic blade. In profile, it is of a lentoid (pointed oval), with tapering edges. The butt is almost square. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt, to a proto stop ridge, and then taper down to the blade. The edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; however a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) is present on both faces of the axe. This has been formed from hammering and small oval shaped (dished) scars can be seen on both faces where the metal has been worked to form them. The ridge itself is not especially prominent, just forming a change of angle between the face of the butt and the face of the blade.



From the blade to the proto stop ridge, decoration, in the series of parallel linear lentoid lozenges. This form of decoration is known as rain-pattern and is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. The side edges of the axe have an almost rope pattern, with two raised areas, suggestive of twisted rope. Beneath the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge. The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through abrasion, as has the blade edge itself. No blade facet is present.



The axehead measures 155.1 mm in length, 92.9 mm wide (blade), 28.1 mm wide (butt), 2.2 mm thick (butt), 12.4 mm thick (stop ridge), 2.0 mm thick (blade). It weighs 425.9 g.

Flat axes decorated with this 'rain pattern' and with crescentic blades can be found during the Willerby metalwork phase, dating from c.1875-1725 BC(Roberts et al, 2013, 23, fig.2.2) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 4 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 125, fig.26, no.53).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) also illustrate developed flat axes with crecentic bades and similar 'rain-pattern' decoration from Ryal and Keighley in plates 28-29, nos.329 & 340, which are classified, respectively, as a Type Falkland developed flat axe, which is compared to an axe from Mount Pleasant in Dorset, dated to c.1900 BC, and a Type Scrabo Hill which is associated with similar axes in the Willerby Wold hoards from East Yorkshire, illustrated in plate 134, nos.D1 & D4.



Several similar flat axeheads have been recorded on the PAS database. They include: CORN-5F6661; DENO-4F12EB; SWYOR-F748BE; SWYOR-6D80EC; and WMID-798FF7.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2016-07-31T23:00:00Z,2016-08-30T23:00:00Z,,,425.9,,,12.4,155.1,1,Teresa Gilmore,Teresa Gilmore,West Midlands,Staffordshire,Lichfield,Fradley and Streethay,SK1514,From finder,52.72344322,-1.77934858,WMID-2260B2,,wmid2260b2.jpg,Early Bronze Age: Complete decorated Flat axehead,Birmingham Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/tgilmore/wmid2260b2.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/609854.jpg

The chisel measures 64.56mm long. It is divided into two parts by a transverse rib. One part, the longer, at 34.30mm, is a rectangular sectioned tool measuring 4.76mm x 3.87mm in section below the rib and tapering to a gouge at the end which is S shaped in cross section. The other part of the implement is also square in section, 28.04mm in length. It measures 4.44mm x 4.05mm in section and tapers more sharply than on the other side, terminating in a narrow point. 



The overall length is 64.56mm and the width (across the rib) is 10.28mm The object weighs 5.61g.

There is damage to the socket and spear edges. The blade is 16.0mm wide, the other measurements are shown below. Side-looped spearheads are Class IV and date from the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, about 1500-1150 BC.Edit

840747,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-700,"A fragment of a Bronze Age sword or dagger blade, 1150-700BC. The object is a sub-rectangular fragment of copper alloy, with a straight, horizontal break or cut at both the top and bottom ends. There is a broad, convex-surfaced mid-rib on either face, flanked by a pair of vertical grooves. Either side of this mid-rib the thickness gradually tapers towards the cutting edge. The blade is broken at either end. The breaks are well patinated and indicate that it was broken in antiquity.

Date: Late Bronze Age - c. 1150 - 700 BC. In this database is similar to DOR-B4D511.

841114,Rapier,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"An almost complete cast copper alloy Middle Bronze Age rapier. The butt is incomplete and damaged which makes the original shape difficult to determine. Two C-shaped incomplete rivet holes or notches lie in the upper part of the butt, which is where the handle would have been attached. The notches are spaced approximately 24.82 mm apart. Slight shadow (shallowing of the metal) of the handle is visible just under the rivet holes extending centrally to the top of the break.

This widest point (49.52 mm) is at the shoulders. The blade extends c. 290 mm from the base of the butt and is approximately 30.61 mm wide at the very top, and narrows to 25.20 mm for much of the length of the blade, gradually narrowing further towards the tip of the blade (7.02 mm). The edge of the blade is damaged in several areas where small notches are missing. On either edge of the blade approximately 54.31 mm from the tip of the blade is a V-shaped notch (one is slightly more pronounced than the other and they are not quite parallel). These look intentional but may of course be damage.

Below the shoulder and extending into the blade, the edge is curved. This is apparent to one edge only as the other is badly disfigured with irregular notches, possibly the result of corrosion as there are large spots or pits close to the edge, presumably corrosion.

A central, clearly defined mid rib extends the length of the blade to the uppermost part of the butt and is slightly more pronounced on one face. The blade lozengiform in cross section.

The surfaces have a dark patina, though one face is very smooth and shows a golden-brown original surface colour. Both faces show heavy pitting along the entire surface of the object.

The total length of the object is 335 mm. The thickness varies along the blade from 6.85 mm towards the top, to 1.43 mm at the tip. It weighs 182 g (to the nearest 2 g).

The rapier has some similarities in terms of dimensions, possible butt shape and rivet hole placement to Burgess and Gerloffs's (1981) Group IV - Type Cloontia (or Group IV: Miscellaneous weapons with archaic butts).",,4,Copper alloy,,Part of an extant museum collection,Building work,1955-01-01T00:00:00Z,1956-12-31T00:00:00Z,,,182,,,6.85,335,1,Therese Kearns,Therese Kearns,South East,City of Southampton,City of Southampton,Bargate,SU4211,Generated from computer mapping software,50.8969587,-1.40415788,HAMP-4E8C83,,HAMP4E8C83.jpg,,Hampshire Cultural Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMP4E8C83.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/610326.jpg

842016,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"Very late Bronze Age Hoard consisting of one gold bracelet, three gold penannular lock-rings and a cauldron fragment all found together in one find spot. The bracelet and two of the lock rings are stained possibly from an organic residue either from the soil or items placed with them. The lock-rings are all made from gold sheet face plates that are bi-conical in form and triangular in section with central tubes and side plates formed from the same sheet and secured by a binding strip of round sectioned gold wire fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding to the rim. The face plates are all decorated with fine, narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates imitating fine wire works. Two of the lock-rings only differ by 1cm in width and 0.1 gram in weight indicting that they are a pair The third smaller lockring is singular however the similar form indicates the same craftsman or at least a the same workshop. The gold bracelet and smaller lock-ring are stained with what could be corrosion products but appears more like organic residue possibly from something in the soil or organic substances included at the time of deposition.



Gold penannular bracelet with a lonzenge-shaped profile, no decoration and flattened slightly expanded to form plain circular terminals.The diameter is 68mm the width is 68mm thickness 6mm, 8mm at the terminals and the weight 66.15g. It shares similarities with a bracelet from Beachy Head in East Sussex  in the British Museum collection number 1824,K/Armilla.18.



Lockring 1. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 34mm the width is 34mm thickness 11mm and the weight 8.24g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.



A central circular opening to the ring - probably once approximately 15mm in diameter - is lined by a third sheet. In effect, this creates an interior but discontinuous tube, with a gap in the vertical plane for the terminal aperture. The top and bottom margins of the tube were folded over the interior rim of the two face plates, giving the ring some structural cohesion. It would appear that the triangular end faces at the terminals were once integral extensions to the interior tube.



The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly creased and misshapen and at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube there is a small tear in the sheet and the concentric circle decoration is damaged through surface scarring. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.



Lockring 2. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 34mm the width is 34mm thickness 10mm and the weight 8.34g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.



The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly creased and misshapen especially at one point of tight creasing in the interior tube and the concentric circle decoration is damaged through surface scarring. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.



Lockring 3. Gold lock-ring with a diameter of 27mm the width is 27mm thickness 10mm and the weight 4.40g. The ring is penannular, circular in shape, with a three dimensional and biconical shape and a triangular shaped cross-section. Two circular and decorated face-plates join at the external circumference. A circular-sectioned wire appears to have been fused to the plate join to form an outer rim-binding. The lock-ring plates are both decorated with narrow and concentric ring furrows incised into the surfaces and parallel with the circular edges of the face plates.



The face plates of the lock-ring are slightly stained from a residue on the surface that could be corrosion but appears to be more like organic residue. The gold has a deep yellow colour, consistent with additions of small proportions of copper to the alloy.



Cauldron fragment. The length is 27mm, the width is 31mm thickness 15mm and the weight 31.33g.



Lockrings are normally found in pairs leading to theories of their use as ear rings or for hair decoration. Although this find is unusual in that there are three however it is extremely likely that two are indeed a pair. It is still not clearly known what the purpose of these objects are however it does seem likely that they are indeed some form or ornamentation probably jewellery. They are usually buried in isolated high places and often in or near hillforts and other prehistoric features such as stone circles such as these were. Investigation of the find spot has revealed that they appear to have been laid in a small hollow in silty clay sub-soil or directly on the prehistoric land surface in two small channels in the limestone bed rock and covered over with stones. The bracelet appears to be a part of the deposition as does the copper alloy cauldron fragment although this could have been residual in the soil. However it's direct proximity to the other objects means that is has to be and should be included in the hoard assemblage.

Lockrings are a distinct class of personal ornament belonging to the Late Bronze Age (Eogan 1969; 1983; 1994; Taylor 1980; Lynch 1991; Northover 1995; Gwilt et al 2005; Needham et al 2007).The artefacts associated with similar lock-rings in hoards across Britain, Ireland and France indicate a secure dating to the Ewart Park phase (Dowris phase in Ireland) of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800BC) (Eogan 1969, 106-7, 130-46; Cowie et al 1991; Northover 1995, 525-9; Needham et al 2008, 43). Recently, a radiocarbon date has been obtained from a sample directly associated with a large hoard of bronze artefacts and six gold lock-rings from near Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland. The sample of wood, surviving within the haft of a socketed axe, provided a date of 2771+-26BP, calibrating to 1000-840BC at 2 sigma (Needham et al 2007, 400; 2008, 43), confirming the above attribution.



The intricate technique and quality of workmanship indicated in the making of lock-rings has long been commented upon, despite their small size (e.g. Eogan 1969, 93). Their precise function as personal ornaments remains uncertain (e.g. Taylor 1980, 68-9). For some, they are interpreted as ear-rings (e.g. Armstrong 1917, 29; Savory 1958, 14), the frequency of their occurrence in pairs being used as supporting evidence. Many would now see them instead as used for gathering the hair, hence their name lock-rings (Raftery 1967; Eogan 1969, 95-6; Lynch 1991, 239-41). What is generally agreed is that they denoted wealth and high-status within Late Bronze Age society. In Britain, the find-spots currently concentrate in three zones: firstly, south-western Ireland; secondly, north and west Wales, Northern England and Southern Scotland and thirdly, East Anglia and south eastern England (Eogan 1969, 97, Fig. 2; 1994, 100, Fig. 41). Their absence to date in the Midlands, mid and south Wales and south western England, with the single exception of one example from Somerset is marked and probably significant.



Gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC); they could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. The distribution of lock-rings shows a North British Group, a South British group, and a French group (Eogan 1969). The suggested date for this example is Late Bronze Age c.1150-800 BC. Similar penannular rings have been reported under the Treasure Act, for example 2014 T193 (ESS-C0C162) and 2012 T832 (SUSS-C65251).



There are currently six lockrings in the British Museum collections. These new examples are very similar to one from Portfield Camp, near Whalley in Lancashire even to the binding strip consisting of a solid round sectioned wire. Museum Number 1966, 1208:1.



They are also very similar to two discovered at Rossett in Wales in 2013 (LVPL-5DFE32) and semi-quantitative surface analysis of the gold was undertaken using a Bruker TRACeR III-SD hand-held X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (HHXRF) with a rhodium tube, and a titanium/aluminium filter. Several readings were taken at 40 kV and 9.6mA for 100 live seconds and quantified with the use of empirical calibrations. The average composition of the gold in freshly exposed and damaged areas was:- Gold 80-81%; silver 14%; copper 5%.The copper and silver contents matched with gold compositions from other Middle and Late Bronze Age artefacts in Ireland and Wales, although the copper content is towards the lower end of the expected range for Late Bronze Age gold (e.g. Hartmann 1980, 158, Figs .12 & 36; Davis 2005, 36 & Fig. 4).

The object has a single midrib visible on both faces, a slight shield shaped pattern below the stop ridge and raised flange facets. The blade of the palstave is sub-triangular in plan, with convex expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is damaged, but appears to be symmetrical. The cutting edge measures 64.2 mm in width and is 3.0 mm thick.



In profile the blade is sub-triangular with the widest section being before the stop ridge. It measures 31.2 mm in width and 27.7 mm thick at the stop ridge.



Beneath the stop-ridge, on each face of the palstave, is a narrow concave depression, which is bordered by raised ridges. This is broadly sub-rectangular (U-shaped) and is usually described as shield shaped. It is visible on both sides, however it is obscured slightly on one face due to a casting flaw, an air bubble, being present. The shield measures 26.4 mm in width and 25.8 mm in length on the clearer face. Through this shield descends a vertical rib that extends to the mid point on the upper blade forming a trident like pattern.



The palstave has a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The flanges are incomplete. At the stop ridge on one face the flange measures 11.7 mm in depth. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 24.2 mm in width and 5.2 thick. No side loop is present.



Overall the palstave measures 169 mm in length, a maximum width of 64.2 mm, and a maximum thickness of 31.4 mm. It weighs 440.6 g.



The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface.

The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group III type which has both a mid-rib and shield decoration forming a trident. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC (http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axes). The axehead fits within Needham Period 5, Burgess Metalworking phase VIII and is likely to be part of the Acton Park II metalworking assemblage.

The blade-end is wide and convex, but not crescentic with pointed ends, like other types from the same period. The blade-end has a pointed oval cross-section, whereas the body of the blade is facetted, creating an elongated hexagonal cross-section; the butt is sub-rectangular in cross-section.

The blade is flat with channelled grooves on the face where the stem rib meets the blade. The mid-rib is rounded and joins a broad circular sectioned socket, which has an outer inset bevel at the socket mouth. The loops are small and squat and are lozenge shape. The loops are undrilled - they are solid rather than hollow. A smaller spearhead but with an almost identical 'loops' was found in AD 1871 in Fyfield, only a couple of kilometers from this example, and is now in the Ashmolean (accession number Ash.M 1927.2706). A small number of similar spearheads with undrilled loops have recently been recorded from across Oxfordshire; from from Cherwell (BERK-D20304), Bampton (BERK-44F126) and Wendlebury (OXON-838037).



With a smooth dark green patina, there is no evidence of this item having been used. The edges are still sharp and there is no indication of wear. The socket diameter is 21.48mm. with an internal diameter of 18.0mm.

Discussion:



Lock-rings are Late Bronze Age ornaments made from gold plates, secured together by a binding strips to create a hollow and incomplete ring. The three gold plates, technically termed face plates, are sometimes decorated with repoussé decoration or with fine concentric incised lines imitating fine wire work. More infrequently, lock-rings are made from face plates formed or constructed from individual gold wires fused together or from striped twisted gold wires soldered together (Murgia et al. 2014). The Hambledon lock-ring is an example of solid face plates decorated with incised decoration. These are relatively rare. Eogan (1969) recorded only three examples (Ibid., fig.4, nos. 39-40, 43) and only two of these (both found between Haverhill and Saffron Walden in Essex) carry decoration that closely resembles the Hambledon find: interlocking chevrons.



A similar example of a triangular cross sectioned lock-ring can be found in ESS-5ECCA2 as well as three examples from LANCUM-C98FBF and two from LVPL-5DFE32.



Lock-rings are known across Britain, Ireland and North-West France (see Eogan 1994, fig. 41). The find is therefore consistent with the known distribution pattern.","As this object is more than 10% precious metal and is probably over 300 years old, The ring will fall under the Treasure Act of 1996.",3,Gold,,Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure,Metal detector,,,2017T349,,2.97,,20.65,5.56,,1,Edwin Wood,Edwin Wood,South East,Hampshire,Winchester,Hambledon,SU6616,GPS (from the finder),50.93967503,-1.06203026,SUSS-5EA230,,PenRingSUSS5EA230.jpg,"A bronze Age gold, penannular ring",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/EdwinWood/PenRingSUSS5EA230.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/613065.jpg

One of the terminals has been damaged and the copper alloy core exposed. The ring is circular in section with flat opposed terminals. The ring has a tiger striped colouration around the inside of the internal diameter. This is a patination found on other examples such as HAMP-C18814 and SUSS-EA6735.



These rings are often erroneously referred to as 'ring money' though there is no evidence to suggest that they were used as currency. They are predominantly believed to have been used for personal adornment, such as earrings or nose rings, they have even been suggested as hair ornaments. A complete example can be found in HAMP-0F9AF6 and there are numerous others recorded on the database, some found as part of hoards.



Work on these rings can be found in (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008), See NMGW-04216C for full references.

844078,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"An incomplete developed flat axe with hammer raised flanges, of later Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2000 BC to c. 1700 BC).



The axehead is broadly rectangular, with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt is narrow and rounded and measures 14.2 mm in width and is 2.7 mm thick. In profile the axe is a sub pointed oval with both terminals tapering. In section the axe is slightly H-shaped as the side edges of the axe have been worked to form a slight raised collar rather than cast flanges. The flanges extend 1.0 mm above the body of the axe head. The expanded blade measures 23.8 mm in width and is 2.5 mm thick.



The axehead measures 52.5 mm in length, maximum width of 23.7 mm (blade), minimum width 14.2 (butt), width 17.4 mm (centre). It is 2.7 mm thick at the blade, 2.7 mm thick at the butt, and 8.0 mm thick at the central point. It weighs 35.6 g.



The axehead is a dark brown colour, with an even but pitted surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



This axehead is similar to those recorded on the PAS database as DOR-28154A and NMS-370DE4, consistent with that of the Arreton type axe, of Early Bronze Age III dating, metalworking stage V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL BC.



Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire) commented on DOR-28154A that the Arreton type of long-flanged developed flat axes (cf Burgess and Schmidt: Axes of Northern Britain pp 65 - 75 specifically 420, 423and 413). Burgess and Schmidt suggest from their study that the distribution of this Arreton type concentrates in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The object appears complete and consists of a rectangular butt end which is 20mm wide and 6mm thick and extends for 46mm. This has flanged sides, which emerge from the butt end and widen until the object is 17mm thick at the point that these turn to form a stop. From here the object narrows out in thickness and widens out into a triangular shaped blade with a slightly curved edge. At the tip it is 57mm wide and 4mm thick. Each edge of the blade has a slight rounded lip and there is a rounded 'rib' running from the centre, where it emerges from the 'stop' dispaearring into the blade surface near its tip.

846394,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side profile of the axe is lentoid with both terminals tapering. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe appears to be undecorated. The butt end of the axe has been hammered flat creating a proto-stop ridge. The blade tip flares outwards from the body forming a concave hollow. The blade appears to be symmetrical. There is an obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge where it has been hammered for sharpening. The surface of the axe has a dark greenish-brown patina. The length is 104mm, the width of blade is 60mm, width of butt is 27mm, thickness 18mm and the weight 134.63g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon.

Description: It is unlooped with high, curved flanges, fused to the stop ridge. The flanges start to rise gradually from the butt, reaching a maximum height above the septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge). There is a molding seam (or ridge) running the middle length of the blade on each side edge although on edge it is obscured by corrosion).There are three longitudinal ridges decorating each face of the blade from the stop ridge unevenly along the blade. The object has suffered heavy pitted corrosion on one edge and a few other areas of the palstave. The blade edge and the butt end are bother highly uneven and abraded which may be evidence of plough damage but the level of wear makes this uncertain. Where it survives the patina is dark green to mid-brown color. The corrosion is a light green turquoise colour.



Measurements:  154.52mm long, 27.17mm wide (at the stop ridge), 58.51mm thick (at blade tip, 23.15mm thick at butt end)  450g (aproximately)



Discussion: http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/axe: The term palstave is very misleading as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool not a type of axe. However the term is used in British archeology to describe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and as time went on developed loops. This example fits the Acton Park (phase 2) or Taunton phases palstaves whcih date it to c. 1500 - c. 1150 BC.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,450,,,58.51,154.52,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Tunbridge Wells,Pembury,TQ6343,Generated from computer mapping software,51.1630289,0.32981026,KENT-2EE95F,,KENT2EE95F.jpg,Palstave axe,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT2EE95F.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/614208.jpg

It has a pronounced midrib that extends to the tip, The blade edges are very worn and taper to a worn blunted point. The butt end terminates in what appears to be an ancient break. Overall, the shape is consistent with a side-looped socketed spear head, but not enough of the object remains for definite identification. The object may be the tip of a rapier - its cross-section is very similar to that of a rapier - but it is more likely to be the tip of a spearhead.

847420,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-1500,"A largely complete but corroded cast copper alloy flat axe of Early Bronze Age date (c. BC 2000 - 1700 ).



The flat axe is broadly sub-rectangular in plan, widening to a gently splayed blade. In profile, it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The flat axe head has an overall length of 100.37mm and the axe weighs 142.6 grams. It should be noted that the axe is relatively small when compared to the corpus of known Early Bronze Age material. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 14.57mm with a thickness of 3.8mm. The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively curved.There is no evidence of a median bevel; however, the axe is thickest at the mid point at 8.71mm. The sides of the blade expand to produce a blade edge width of 30.37mm. The blade edge has been damaged through either corrosion or wear.



There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe due to corrosion and patina. The axe is a mid green brown colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present.



This example is comparable with some of the earliest known copper axe and early bronze axes discovered in Britain.The axehead is likely to date from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age, and is comparable to Migdale axes although not containing all the attributes of the type. Many Migdale axes tend to have narrower butts which flare more at the cutting edge to crescent blades. Examples of similar Migdale axes can be found in Schmidt and Burgess 'The Axes of Scotland and Northern England'.

Description: The dagger survives only as the point end and has linear decoration of six parallel lines creating a ribbing effect, on both sides, running either side of a mid-rib to meet below but on the same line as blade point. The dagger has a lozenge-shaped cross section and the break is ragged and appears to have happened in antiquity. Despite the break the blade is in relatively good condition save for a number of nicks along its edge. The blade is a dark brown and orange colour and is not showing particularly obvious signs of copper corrosion.



Measurements: 78.62mm long, 22.49mm wide, 3.25mm thick and 16.6g in weight



Discussion: This fragment likely relates to a dagger of early Bronze Age, specifically of Camerton-Snowshill type or a derivative thereof, these daggers relate to the end of the early Bronze Age (Period 4)  c.1750-1550 BC.","

The blade is blunt and has been heavily worn, the cutting edge is now lost. The palstave was possibly reground several times owing to the lack of expanded blade at the edges. The widest section of the palstave is at the stop ridge. Below the stop ridge on one face the axe has been decorated with three vertical ridges or ribs which are converging. The opposing face has no evidence of similar decoration although the surface is very worn.



The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is broadly triangular in plan and profile and rectangular in cross section. The butt of the axe is narrowed and incomplete. The butt end measures 18.25mm in width and is 7.74mm thick. The septum (the area between the flange facets and the stop ridge) is square in plan and measures 27.02mm in width. The side loop is incomplete and measures 27.9mm in length externally and is 11.9mm in length internally. Only the base of the loop remains on both sides which are broadly circular in section. The object has a mid-green coloured uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movement within the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



Scmidt and Burgess, (1981), illustrate similar examples which fit the Type Nettleham, plate 67, no 930, which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Age and fits with Needham Period 5-6 Metalworking Assemblage X, dating it to the period BC 1050 -BC 950. This marked a transition between palstaves and socketed axeheads. Other examples have been recorded on the PAS database including (WMID-306462) discovered in Staffordshire and (LIN-709F56) discovered in Nottinghamshire. Good parallels can also be seen from Hockenhul, Cheshire (LVPL-B27017) and also a mixed hoard of Late palstaves and socketed axes from Amport, Hampshire (HAMP-4DE734 etc). The nature of this hoard suggests this form of decorated axe has a potentially long life (well into the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). A distinctive pattern on their distribution has not been produced, however, Evans (1881) identifies a number of this form of axehead being discovered in the Welsh Marches specifically from Llandysilio (Denbighshire) and Fronheulog, Merionethshire (ibid: p92-93).



The object measures 126.20mmin length, is 32.32mmwide at the stop ridge. It has a maximum thickness of 23.93 mm at the stop ridgeand weighs 279.8 grams.

848748,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"A complete copper alloy probable Aylesford miniature type flat axehead of the Early Bronze Age period, probably dating from c. BC 2250 - c. BC 1900. This fits with Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II / III), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2250 - 1900 CAL. BC.



The axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid (pointed oval) in shape. The edges of the axe have been damaged but much of it remains. The sides of the axe gently exapnd in width from the rounded rectangular butt to the blade. The edges of the axe have been raised slightly on both sides forming shallow flanges. There is a slight median bevel (proto stop ridge) about a third of the way down the axe, this is present on both front and reverse faces but is clearer on the front face. The ridge is not especially prominent however there is a distinct bevel (change of angle) from butt to ridge and from ridge to blade Below the bevel the sides continue to exapnd. The area from the ridge to the blade junction shows evidence of being decorated. The decoration is in the form of a series of parrallel linear lentoid lozenges, these seem to be diagonal and seem to be angled in different directions, although this is difficult to see clearly. This form of decoration is known as rain patternand is common on the later decorated examples of the Migdale tradition and early Aylesford tradition. The decoration is best observed under a raking light. The patination is heavily damged and abraded it is difficult to tell whether there is further decoratio. The decoration stops at the blade facet. Below the rain pattern decoration the sides of the blade taper slightly to form a shallow crescent shaped blade, a distinct blade facet is present. The right edge of the blade on the front face shows signs of ancient damage, probably as a result of time and movement whilst within the plough soil.



The axehead measures 91.2 mm in length, the butt is 19.4 mm wide and the blade measures 39.7 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.5 mm, the ridge measures 7.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 87.8 g.



The axehead is a mid green to mid brown in colour with a highly polished patina which has been damage across much of the surface, especially on the reverse. Probably as a direct of the movement of the object whilst within the plough soil. There are, however, a series of large scars which have removed areas of decoration. Where this damage has occurred a light grey green powdery corrosion is evident. The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Migdale tradition (specifically the decorated variant) dated: 2250-1900 CAL. BC / end of EBA II - III. This axehead forms part of the corpus of earliest developed bronze axes of Britain. Other broadly similar examples of this type of axehead have been recorded in Schmidt and Burgess (1981), plate 27, (or page 61), No 310 or 312.

848968,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-801,"Description: Dispersed hoard of six copper alloy objects consisting of; 




	
Socketed spearhead. Bevelled, leaf-shaped blade, missing the tip and most of the cutting edge. The circular socket terminates in a jagged break which is not fresh, but is comparatively recent. It exhibits prominent casting seams down each long edge. Length: 97mm. Diameter of socket 14.2mm. Maximum extant width of blade: 17.1mm. Extant length of blade 74mm. Weight 35.3g.  

	
Fragment of socketed spearhead comprising part of the cylindrical socket. It exhibits the stubs of the cast side loops on either side, on the same line as the longitudinal casting ribs. The socket terminates in worn breaks at either end. Heavily pitted. Length: 29.7mm. It expands in diameter from 7.6mm to 12.2mm. Weight: 6.2g. 

	
 Tanged dagger or knife cut down from a dirk or rapier. Rectangular blade with a low central midrib and lozengiform cross-section. The butt end is rounded and has an off-centre rivet hole. The blade has a bend approximately halfway along its length, giving the blade a slightly S-shaped profile. This is likely to be post-depositional damage rather than deliberate. The blade terminates in a relatively fresh transverse break. Extant length: 90mm. Maximum width: 15.7mm. Thickness: 1.8mm. Weight: 15.1g. 

	
Ring. Undecorated, with a slight circumferential edge running around the outside. The inner edge exhibits a notch 14.1mm wide on one side, from wear. The surface is pitted and flaked in patches. External diameter: 34.2mm. Internal diameter: 21.4mm. Thickness: 5.8mm. Weight: 16.2g. 

	
Casting waste. Fragment of a casting sprue. Trapezoidal in shape and roughly oval in cross-section. Length: 19.8mm. Maximum width: 29.4mm. Minimum width: 14.1mm. Maximum thickness: 20.5mm. Minimum thickness: 3.9mm. Weight: 33.1g. 

	
Unidentified object. C-shaped fragment with relatively recent break at one end and worn break at the other. It expands in thickness from one end to the other and exhibits a prominent recessed channel running down the centre. Near the thickened end is a projecting stub terminating in an old break. Length: 27.5mm. Maximum width: 11.6mm. Minimum width: 5.9mm. Maximum thickness: 7.2mm. Minimum thickness: 2.9mm. Weight: 11.2g. 





Discussion: Although the group was scattered over a wide area across a single field (see grid references), Neil Wilkin (Curator, Bronze Age Europe, pers. comms.) stated that the group appeared to consist of contemporary objects and should therefore be considered as a potential hoard. Nos. 1 – 3 can all be assigned a Middle to Late Bronze Age date. 



No. 3 is paralleled by a number of similar finds on the PAS database, particularly BERK-80BA1E. This record notes a comment from Dot Boughton that Burgess and Gerloff (1981) include a blade of similar shape and size in their Group II (Damaged Blades Modified for Rehafting), p. 36, Plate 32, no 248, described as ""Tanged blade, either a knife made in this form or possibly a dirk with butt cut down for rehafting, in which case the torn rivet hole would have been secondary…."" 



No. 4 is also likely to be contemporaneous. Similar rings have been discovered in a number of Bronze Age hoards and have been suggested as horse harness fittings; as being part of the handles of a sheet-metal cauldron, of Class A1 (Type Tul-na-cross) and Class B1 (Types Llyn Fawr, Ballyshannon and Castlederg) (Gerloff 2010, Pl. 17, 7b; Pl.32, 14a; Pl. 33, 14f-h; Pl. 34, 15d, Pl. 54, 33c and Pl. 66, 37g); or part of a chain from which a cauldron or other vessel was suspended over a fire.



It is likely that the objects form a single find of Late Bronze Age date.","It is likely that the objects form a single find of Late Bronze Age date, which qualifies the group as treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002).",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure,Metal detector,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2017-04-29T23:00:00Z,2017T492,,116.9,,,,,6,Julie Shoemark,Julie Shoemark,,,,,,,,,NMS-545F3E,,64326_545F3E_BA_Hoard_Assemblage.jpg,Bronze Age hoard (assemblage),Norfolk County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/awilliamsnorfolk/64326_545F3E_BA_Hoard_Assemblage.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1129619.jpg

The bracelet is formed from a single bar of copper alloy that has been twisted to create a spiralling effect around much of its length. Towards the two terminal ends the wire is not twisted and instead is a short length of rectangular section. The terminals are hooked allowing the bracelet to be joined together. The wire terminates in a point on each terminal hook. Althogh now slightly distorted, it is evident that the closed diameter of the bracelet would have been very small.



Spiral torcs are known from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400-1200 BC) and twisted wire torcs and cabled bracelets from the Iron Age and Roman periods, however the form of this example suggests an early date. No direct comparison for the small size can be found on the PAS database nor in the usual literature however twisted torcs are a well-known artefact of the 'Ornament Horizon' period of the Middle Bronze Age. Of example recorded with the PAS there are two recently discovered spiral torcs from Hampshire (SUR-9A711C), while a much grander example from Wiltshire shows the skill of the manufacturers (WILT-12B9D2).

852553,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2000,-1700,"A complete Early Bronze Age cast copper-alloy undecorated developed flat axe (c. 2000-1700 BC): This implement is sub-rectangular in plan with an expanded crescent shaped blade. The butt, in plan, is complete with a rounded terminal. The side profile of the axe is lentoid with both terminals tapering. In cross section the body of the axe has lentoid profile. The axe is decorated with short incised probably chiselled lines below the stop ridge and along the length to the blade. The butt end of the axe has been hammered flat creating a proto-stop ridge. The blade tip flares outwards from the body forming a concave hollow. The blade appears to be symmetrical. There is an obvious cutting edge bevel towards the blade edge where it has been hammered for sharpening. The surface of the axe has a dark greenish-brown patina. The length is 133mm, the width of blade is 78mm, width of butt is 28mm, thickness 18mm.



The axehead is best described as coming from the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (EBA III) of metalworking stage IV-V (more likely V) specifically within the developed flat axe tradition which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2000 - 1700 CAL.BC. This axe is very similar to a number of examples specifically from the type: Brandon. These are described by Burgess and Schmidt in Catalogue of the Axes in Northern Britain as: being ""notably smaller than other advanced flat axes, usually under 130mm length. They have straight parallel or near parallel sides which curve out suddenly just above the blade to a widely expanded crescentic cutting edge.

852556,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age small cast copper alloy flat axe with a narrow butt end and a slightly flanged blade, dating from the Early Bronze Age c. 2125-1950 BC. The edge of the blade of the axe appears to be unused, and the size of the axe suggests that it might have been used for votive reasons. The colour suggests that the axe is copper-rich and the original surface survives well in places, with patches of corrosion product and a few pits, and a few marks on one face of the blade. Otherwise the axe is in good condition. Flat axes with narrow butt ends with rectangular sections and slightly flanged blades can be found during the Brithdir metalwork phase (c.2150-2000 BC) of the Early Bronze Age, such as the Class 3 axe illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, 123, fig.24, no.34). Plain axes like this are also classified as Type Migdale which belong to 'Metalworking Assemblage III', corresponding to Needham's (1996, 122) Period 2 (c.2300-2050 BC).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate a similar small flat axe from Patrington in plate 14, no.176, which is classified as a Type Migdale flat axe.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender Migdale type flat axe from Salcombe in Devon, on pages 453 & 599, plate 38, no.289.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate the latest small, slender Migdale type of flat axe to be recorded in the South West, from Bishop's Tawton in Devon, on page 87, pl.14, no.111.



The Migdale Phase is now dated from c.2125-1950 BC (Roberts et al. 2013, p.23, fig.2.2).

The axe has two triangular flanges (diamond-shaped from the side).

Description:The ingot is a plano-convex discoid shape possibly suggesting the production in a bowl furnace rather than a mould. The upper is flat but with a large knop or swelling relating to the casting gate used in its production. The bottom is a rounded convex shape. The ingot is heavily pitted likely due to a mix of impurities in its matrix and the uneven natural material used to create the bowl in which it was cast.



Measurements:121mm in diameter, 41.49mm thick and 1,225g in weight



Discussion:The bowl furnaces were developed during the Mediterranean Bronze Age, becoming popular in Britain in the Late Bronze Age and were used intermittently to the modern era for many types of metal. It becomes much rarer in the production of copper-alloy after the Roman Period. Iron Age and Roman bun ingots tend to be much heavier than those of the bronze age often weighing upwards of 12kg, this example weighing only 1.25kg would be suggestive of a late Bronze Age date.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,1225,,121,41.49,,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Canterbury,Barham,TR2149,GPS (from the finder),51.19745492,1.16182545,KENT-14DDA6,,KENT14DDA6.jpg,Copper-alloy bun ingot of likely late Bronze Age date,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT14DDA6.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/618980.jpg

The spearhead comprises a leaf shaped blade with chamfered edges and a conical socket with two circular peg holes; one to either side of the socket which are positioned in line with the blade.

856173,Hammer,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-900,-800,"Description:



A complete cast copper-alloy socketed hammer, probably dating the late Bronze Age 'Ewart Park' phase (c.900-800 BC).



Whilst the hammer is sub-rectangular in cross-section, viewed in plan from above the hammer is rectangular, and the convex sides are sub-rectangular. The hammer is section waisted, expanding into a flared collar, with four concentric grooves (or three bands or 'ribs') encircling the base of the flared socket end. The socket mouth is sub-circular whilst the interior void appears to taper toward the hammer end. Casting lines running along the upper and lower face of the hammer indicate that it was cast in two parts. These casting marks have mostly been removed or ground out; however, they are clearly visible at the point at which the four concentric grooves meet. The hammer tapers sharply from the socket toward the mid-point, before again flaring more gently toward the hammer face. The striking face of the hammer shows evidence of extensive use-wear, with a pronounced uneven slant visible, together with numerous nicks and gouges.



The hammer has a dark brown patina and, with the noted exception of contemporary use-wear, is in excellent condition with no obvious signs of active corrosion.



Discussion:



The earliest socketed hammers are recovered from Middle Bronze age contexts, such as those described by Rowlands (1976a and b) and Eogan (1964 274-5) from the Irish 'Bishopland Phase' (approximately contemporary to the Taunton Phase, c.1400-1250BC). However, hammers are more commonly found in association with Late Bronze Age hoards (Rowlands, 1976), as the hammer above was. Burgess (1968, 19) notes that later examples are ""invariably embellished, usually with some form of collar"". The concentric ribs on the example under discussion here could be interpreted as a form of collar; the collar is, however, much clearer on the hammers recorded on the PAS database as YORYM-ABCCE1 and FAKL-9C9543. Nevertheless, the latter examples are the closet parallels thus far recorded by the PAS, particularly as they too have circular sockets. Burgess (ibid) further notes that few parallels exist for the ""longer socketed hammer"" in Northern Britain, of which the hammer described above is likely to be an example. However, it is noticeably shorter by c.20mm than similar long socketed hammers, including hammer LVPL-5A6D83. In common with the majority of these examples, and the remainder of Hoard 2015-T566/DUR-1F5057 (with which the hammer was found; see below) a date consistent with the Late Bronze Age Ewart Park Phase (c.900-800 BC) is likely. At the time of writing, the hammer constitutes the furthest north recorded example on the PAS database, and the first recovered from Co. Durham.



Note:



The hammer was found with Bronze Age Hoard (2015-T566; DUR-1F5057) and was initially thought to be unrelated. However, the object has since been identified as a late Bronze Age hammer, and has been reported as Treasure on the basis that is was found in the same place as, and had previously been together with, another object that is Treasure (that is, the hoard 2015-T566; DUR-1F5057) and thus falls under the stipulations of the 1996 Treasure Act.

856345,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1100,"Looped palstave of Gr.III (Low-flanged, broad-bladed) type (following Schmidt and Burgess 1981). It dates broadly to the Middle Bronze Age and more specifically to the Taunton/early Penard phases (1400-1200 BC) (Needham et al. 1997).



This is a complete palstave with leaf-shaped flanges that rise from the septum below the butt to about the height of the stop. It has a long slender butt, with a straight end and a thick septum (c.10mm). In plan, the flanges form a straight, rectangular stop ridge and taper in very slightly toward the butt end. A thick side loop is positioned on one side overlapping the stop ridge.



The blade is broad and crinoline in shape, with a curved cutting edge and faint signs of a bevelled edge. The bevelling and curvature of the cutting edge indicates it was worked, which is supported by the slightly asymmetrical form of the edge. This may be the resulting of casting, uneven working or resharpening. There are no macroscopic sharpening or grinding striations visible. Both faces are adorned with a raised midrib, extending from below the stop about halfway down the blade (44.6mm long); it is more pronounced on one face than the other.



There is a lateral flattened ridge down each side of the palstave, which indicates the remains of the casting flash which has been ground and hammered down, though it is particularly prominent around the side loop. Furthermore, there is a shallow shrinkage hollow in the septum at the stop on one face, which is a common flaw for palstaves, caused as the metal cools after casting.



The palstave is covered in an even, consistent pale brown patina preserving the original surface. Active pale green corrosion is visible in small patches, particularly around the edges and fresh bronze can be seen on one side of the cutting edge indicating post-recovery damage. Patches of dark blue corrosion product can be seen on the septum on one face.



Dimensions: Length: 167mm; Blade width 65.1mm; Butt width: 18.3mm; Stop breadth: 35.3mm; Stop width: 22.7mm; Flange breadth: 33.1mm; Flange height: 10mm; Weight: 503.4g.","A wide variation of palstave types are known from throughout the Middle Bronze Age and this example has characteristics most similar with those from the Taunton phase (1400-1275 cal. BC), but could extend into the Penard phase (1275-1100 cal. BC) (Needham et al. 1997).

Close parallels for this palstave are difficult to identify though. While it appears to fall broadly within Schmidt and Burgess' (1981) Group III Low-flanged, it does not conform to any of their sub-types or variants. The combination of a broad crinoline blade, side loop and midrib is unusual. Additionally, the breadth of the flanges is quite large (33.1mm) - typically one would expect low flange breadth to fall below 31mm. In southern Britain, it most closely matches Rowlands (1976) Class 5, Group 1 of broad-bladed looped palstaves. Parallels with lower flanges can be seen in his catalogue from Watchingwell on the Isle of Wight (Rowlands 1976, No.576, Pl.31) and Northamptonshire (ibid, No.811, Pl.30). A similar palstave from Wales is recorded from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan (NMGW-CF16C3), though that example has a flared, triangular blade and lower flanges.



The most similar example in terms of form and dimensions was found at Priddy, Somerset (SOM-1AD5D4), which was found associated with another palstave and found close to the Priddy gold ornament hoard, dating to the Taunton phase (Minnitt and Payne 2012). Deep flanges and crinoline blades are a typical feature of palstaves from South West England and this palstave may indicate influence from this area.",3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,503.4,,,,167,1,Matthew Knight,Matthew Knight,Wales,Powys,Powys,Llanfrynach,SO0625,From finder,51.91556676,-3.36808188,NMGW-609095,,2017142.jpg,Middle Bronze Age bronze palstave,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2017142.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/622078.jpg

Tang and blade were separated by a now very worn collar.



These artefacts tend to be identified as chisels, i.e. wood-working tools, such as in WREX-9F314E. However, they resemble (in size and shape) Earliest Iron Age so-called socketed chisels (SUR-2B05A8) which have now been reinterpreted as leather-working knives. Thus, the earlier tanged examples may be better identified as leather-working knives owing to their often thin, wide blades (IOW-383C47 and WAW-CEC22C).



The chisel measures 37.9mm in length, 41.1mm in width, 5.7mm at maximum thickness at the tang, and weighs 19.61g.

856846,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-2300,"An incomplete copper alloy palstave axe head dating from the Mid Bronze Age, c.1250-1000 BC. The axe is rectangular is shape in the body, widening slightly towards the cutting edge, which is sub-circular and curved. A hammered and trimmed casting seam is visible. In profile the cutting edge narrows to a rounded point, it is narrow which suggests that it is probably a transitional palstave. In cross section the axe head is triangular in shape. There is a worn break across the body of the axe head, which is rectangular in cross section. The axe head has a dark green patina. The palstave measures 32.0,mm in length, 28.4mm in width across the blade, 30.2mm in width across the body, 16.3mm in maximum thickness, and weighs 105g.","The style of the cutting edge corresponds with the Taunton and Penard assemblages (predominately Taunton) - which fits into Needham periodisation as Period 5 (Burgess Metalworking stage IX).

856952,Dirk,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A Middle Bronze Age copper-alloy rapier or dirk hilt fragment with patches of original surface surviving. The remains of two rivet holes survive only partially on the upper heavily worn and eroded external edge of the hilt. The hilt is broadly is trapezoidal in shape. The width of the blade at the break is 16.79mm and the measurement between the rivet holes is 25.89mm. There is no evidence of a raised or cast mid-rib to the blade



The distinction between dirks and rapiers is difficult when the fragment is as small as this example - the main difference between a dirk and a rapier is that a Rapier is over 30cm long and therefore considered to be more of a thrusting weapon whilst a Dirk is under 30cm and so more useful for stabbing. However it is often difficult to identify whether a blade is a dirk or a rapier as they are frequently found in a fragmentary state. From the size of this example it is more likely to have been from a dirk (dagger). Good PAS examples can be seen from Bampton, Oxfordshire (GLO-036A39), and Flawborough, Nottinghamshire (DENO-C2BC23). The findspot of this example - in the environs and watercatchment area of the River Mole - is common for such metalwork.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,32.03,,,4.38,64.02,1,Margaret Broomfield,Margaret Broomfield,South East,Surrey,Elmbridge,Cobham and Downside,TQ1058,GPS (from the finder),51.31049348,-0.4232012,SUR-B671B3,,17944.jpg,Bronze Age: Rapier fragment,Surrey County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/17944.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/631294.jpg
857031,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"A small cast socketed (probably side-looped) spearhead, dating probably from the early Middle Bronze Age, c.1600-1400BC.



The object has a broken blade of indented quadrilateral section. There is a prominent longitudinal mid-rib on both sides and abraded cutting edges. Approximately one third of the blade has been broken off. A deep sub-circular socket of 6.04mm diameter is present. Much of the original surface has corroded and is lost; however, that which survives has a mid-brown patina. the remiainder of the object has a mottled green-grey patina.



The head measures 5.9mm in length and 15.96mm wide at its widest point. The blade is 10.07mm thick at the rib and weighs 15.5g.



It is most likely that the object is a spearhead as described above, the spear having being broken at the base resulting in the loss of the side loops. As such the record for similar spearhead LANCUM-7609C0 states that: ""Side-looped spearheads are Greenwell and Brewis' Class IV and date to the early Middle Bronze Age. They are likely to belong to the Acton Park 2, Taunton (Cemmaes) or Penard metalwork assemblages, corresponding to Needham's (1997) Period 5, c. 1500-1150BC. The spearhead was likely to have been short and similar to Savory (1980) nos. 227 - 230, which Savory argues are of Acton Park metal, although no. 228 gave an analysis suggesting Penard metal. A side-looped spearhead from the Thames at Mortlake (DoB 31) has been radio-carbon dated by Needham et al (1997) producing an early radiocarbon date of 3225+/- 65BP (OxA-5948) 1680-1400BC with a 95% confidence rating.""



Whilst rare, there exists the possibility that the object could be an arrowhead. Information on the database states that ""Socketed arrowheads, whilst originally noted as being absent from UK finds have appeared across England, with the majority being found in the Midlands, with an example each from North Yorkshire and Shropshire. These artefacts are often found heavily corroded and thus can easily be mistaken for a small spearhead.""

857591,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1700,-1500,"Early Bronze Age hoard of two incomplete flanged axes and one spearhead.



1. and 2. Class 5Db Long-flanged axe (2 conjoining fragments)



Dimensions: surviving length blade fragment 1 - 71.9mm; surviving length butt fragment 2 - 28.2mm; combined total length approx.108.8mm; blade width (fragment 1) - 47.9mm; butt width fragment 2 - 21.0mm; maximum thickness at flanges (fragment 1 ) - 17.5mm; maximum height of flanges (fragment 1) - 3.0mm; weight fragment 1 - 154.1g; fragment 2 - 28.3g; combined weight 182.4g.



These are two conjoining fragments of a complete, slender, bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides of the axe are straight and near parallel, although there is a subtle impression of a curved and waisted effect, created by the curvature of the sides and inward curving effect of the flanges. The sides curve out suddenly to an expanded blade with a crescentic cutting edge. The butt shows some curvature, although with sub-angular corners, rather than truly arched form. Approximately 54mm from the butt end, there is a median bevel across both faces. The flanges rise approximately 3mm above the septum on each face. The sides of the axe are evenly curved and undecorated. Striations running parallel with the blade edge on the blade bevels indicate that the axes was sharpened for use. The break surfaces on the two fragments are soil covered and do not appear to be recent. The overall patina is dark green, although with extensive mottled patches of lighter blue-green and pitting evident on all faces and along edges.



3. Long flanged axe butt fragment (Class 5)



Dimensions: surviving length 62.0mm; butt width 19.8mm; maximum thickness at flanges 13.4mm; maximum surviving height of flanges approx. 1.5mm; width at break 24.3mm; weight 79.7g.



This is a butt and mid-section of a slender bronze flanged axe with cast flanges. The sides are straight but slightly divergent. The butt is high arched and with a pinched tapering form in side view. The flanges are worn and rise a maximum of 1.5mm above the septum. The sides are curved and undecorated, although one side has slight angularity suggesting uneven hammering. Approximately 47.5mm from the butt, there is a median bevel across both faces. Across the break, the axe reveals an asymmetry in cross-section, with one side and flanges narrower than the other. On one side, the thickness, including flanges, is 13.4mm and the septum is 9.7mm thick, while on the other, the thickness including flanges is 12.0mm and the thickness of the septum is 9.1mm. Some of this asymmetry, most marked near the break, may have been created by the forcible twisting and breaking of the axe, causing localised deformation of the metal. The break surface is soil covered and the break was made in antiquity. The axe has a dark grey-green patination, with areas of mottled pitting with lighter blue-green corroded surfaces.



4. Type 2A Decorated Early Pegged and Socketed Spearhead 



Dimensions: length 196.0mm; maximum width blade 33.8mm; external diameter socket 22.8mm (side to side) by 22.1mm top to bottom; maximum blade thickness (base) 13.2mm; depth of socket approx.. 82.5mm; diameter peg holes (1) 6.8mm (side to side) by 4.7mm (top to bottom); (2) 7.2mm (side to side) by 4.4mm (top to bottom); weight 179.9g



This is a complete bronze spearhead with a triangular shaped blade, tapering near the point. The blade has a narrow and prominent lozenge midrib and the blade is enclosed by a raised bevel, with deep blade channels and a V-shaped raised base. The base of the blade edges merge with the oval-shaped socket with shallow concave curves. The socket retains angularity down both sides, in line with the blade edges, only becoming indistinct near the mouth. The base of the socket shaft extends only to the base of the blade and the blade is solid cast. Near the socket mouth (5-7mm from the mouth edge), are tow oval shaped peg-holes, each with recessed external borders.



The socket of the spearhead has been decorated on both sides, although it is better preserved on one face and indistinct on the other. At the top and beneath the V-shaped blade base, an incised V-shaped pair of parallel lines, approximately 2.5m apart, is infilled with short parallel lines. Beneath this, a banded decorative schema is aligned at right angles to the axis of the spear and parallel with the socket mouth edge. The first decorative band is a single zone of infilled chevrons, enclosed by two incised lines approximately 3mm apart. Between this and the next zone of decoration is a plain band, bordered by a second double band of decoration, 5mm wide and comprising three parallel incised lines, each infilled with angled and parallel lines all of the same alignment. Following a further plain band, is a third, single zone of infilled chevrons, defined by two lines. The fourth and final banded decoration, comprises two linear incised bands, with a herringbone infilled pattern of parallel lines. At the lower margin, bordered by the socket mouth edge, a short stretch of shorter incised, and angled dash marks defines the edge. The upper band of decoration abuts the lower margins of each peg-hole, although it is not possible to say whether the decoration was applied before or after the peg-holes were shaped.



There are striations visible on the blade bevel, running parallel to the blade edge in places, suggesting sharpening for use. On one face, one of the lateral blade channels has been markedly deepened with an angular striation, possibly created in antiquity during preparation of the blade edges. On one upper socket face, there is a rectangular shaped punched depression set into the face. Localised deformation above and below this, suggests this may have been deliberate and forcible damage, either during use, or immediately before deposition. There is a split in the wall of the socket mouth on one side. One or two scratches and scrapes appear to have been made during the recent past, during ploughing or retrieval from the soil. The surfaces of the spearhead are extensively pitted and the spearhead has a dark grey-green patination.","The two Class 5 long-flanged axes and the Early Pegged and Socketed Spearhead within this artefact group may all be dated to the same Arreton phase (Period 4, Metalwork Assemblage VI) of the Early Bronze Age (e.g. Northover unpublished, 104-13; Burgess & Cowen 1972; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 70-5; Needham et al 1985, iii; Needham 1996, 132-3; Rohl & Needham 1998, 91-2). They are contemporary with the Wessex 2 rich grave tradition and Camerton-Snowshill dagger and knife series across southern Britain, now independently radiocarbon dated to 1750/1700-1500 BC (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 179-80; Needham & Woodward 2008, 7, Fig. 3; Needham et al 2010, 364-5 & Table 1; Woodward & Hunter 2015, 462).



The complete flanged-axe (Nos. 1 & 2 above) best correlates with Type Arreton long-flanged axes most densely distributed across southern, eastern and south-western England (e.g. Burgess & Cowen 1972, 176-8, Figs. 6 & 7; Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 72-5, Cats. 408-25B; Needham 1985; Needham et al 1985, iii; Northover unpublished Cats. 95-108). When the critical measurements for these flanged axes are applied within Needham's metrical classification of Class 5 axes for central and southern Britain (Needham 1983, 198-250), it appears to fit within the parameters of Class 5Db axes, with their narrow blade edges, while its relative flange height of 0.03714 sits within the range for true Class 5 flanged axes (Needham 1983, 65-6 & 198, Figs. 72-6).



The butt fragment of a long-flanged axe (Nos. 3 above) also exhibits attributes most closely correlated with a Type Arreton long-flanged axe: narrow form, cast flanges, a high arched butt with pinched tapering form in side section and a median bevel (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 72). The surviving flange heights, at 1.5mm, are low for a true Class 5 flanged axe, although they may once have been higher and they do look to be cast rather than hammered. Given the absence of a blade end for this fragmentary axe, it is not possible to allocate it to sub-class on metrical grounds (Needham 1983, 198-250). The asymmetry of this flanged axe in cross-section is interesting and may indicate forcible twisting and breaking prior to deposition.



The spearhead (No. 4 above) may be identified as an Early Socketed Spearhead of Group 2 and Type 2A of Pegged form (Davis 2012, 40-1). This example may be closely paralleled with examples from Colwick, Nottinghamshire, Twickenham, London West Row Fen, Suffolk and Stow cum Quy, Cambridgeshire (Davis 2012, 41, Cats. 50, 53-5, Plates 5-6). Decorated examples of both pegged and looped forms of Early Socketed Spearheads are a repeating occurrence. A number have banded decoration on their sockets, while infilled chevron designs, as one the Wenvoe example, have also been previously observed (Davis 2012, Cats. 49, 50, 52, 54, 60, 64, 66, 74-6 & Pls.5-7).



The finder's account of the discovery of these artefacts indicate that the two conjoining fragments of flanged axe (Nos. 1 & 2 above) were found within 2m of each other at a depth of 20-25cm beneath the surface. The flanged axe butt fragment (No. 3 above) was found at a similar depth but approximately 8-10m to the south-south-west and following the line of modern ploughing of the field. The spearhead (No. 4 above) was found at a very shallow depth of just 2-3cm (1 inch), immediately after later deep ploughing of the field. It was located some 13-15m away from the first two flanged axe fragments, to the north-north west and nearer to the field hedge line and lane bordering the field to the north. It is probable that these artefacts had been buried together and at the same time during the Early Bronze Age as a hoard group, possibly in a shallow and isolated pit. The original hoard was probably disturbed and dispersed by the farmer during recent ploughing activity, who was also the finder in this instance.
