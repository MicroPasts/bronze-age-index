893324,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1200,"A complete copper-alloy annular bracelet/arm-ring probably of Bronze Age date 1400 - 1300 BC. The Liss-type bracelet is solid and oval in section and in good condition with brown patina. The body is decorated with incised or engraved panels which are relatively deep and have been applied with some degree of care. The complex decoration comprises of panels of lines or rows of stacked chevrons creating a herringbone pattern separated by 'dividing' sections of 10 or more lines of vertical bands (to the circumference of the bracelet-arming). The three central panels are comprised of 8 or 9 horizontal bands that widen to create an oval, the centre of which are decorated with 6 vertical bands.



As an oval, the external diameter is 95.5mm by 83.7mm with an internal diameter of 66.8mm by 52.1mm and a width of 12.9 mm. A comparison on the database is: SUR-590F5D no.1","Similar plain and incised (Liss-type) bracelets in copper alloy are not common finds. They are known from the Taunton phase (1,400 -1,200 BC) of the Bronze Age onwards, mainly from Southern Britain. These bracelets concentrate in the southern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and West Sussex and examples are also known from Suffolk and Norfolk. Incised decorated bracelets form part of a North European tradition, which has led to the suggestion that the examples from southern England may be imported from northern France, although this theory has been questioned (O'Connor 1980). While some of the known bracelets come from hoards containing items such as torcs, pins, axes, palstaves and other mid-Bronze Age artefacts, no other objects were found in association with this example. See Recent Metalwork Discoveries in Hampshire for a comprehensive report, published by Sally Worrell in Hampshire Studies (2002, no.1). They are comparatively rarer than tools and weapons. Similar examples were found in the Ebbesbourne Wake hoard (Moore and Rowlands 1972:63-5, Plate XV) and a hoard from Norton Fitzwarren (Needham in Ellis 1989:31-31, 36).",4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,346.5,83.7,,12.9,,1,Dr. Lindsey Smith,Dr. Lindsey Smith,South East,Oxfordshire,Cherwell,Merton,SP5719,From finder,51.8666749,-1.17358811,BERK-7B524E,,BAbracelet.jpg,BA Bracelet,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/rod/BAbracelet.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1006991.jpg

896436,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"A copper alloy lower blade fragment from a palstave dating to the Middle Bronze Age, circa 1500-1300 BC. 



The shape of the fragment is sub-triangular in plan and triangular in profile; the cross section at the break is sub-rectangular in form. The blade is broken below the stop ridge, due to this it is uncertain whether this fragment is from a looped - or unlooped palstave variant. The sides of the palstave gently taper from the break to the blade where the tips of the blade protrude markedly. The cutting edge is crescentic and relatively well defined, however it is very worn and the cutting edge is now abraded. Both faces of the axe have single central swollen ribs that extend to above the blade. 



The palstave fragment has a mid-green coloured slightly abraded patina. 



Burgess and Schmidt (1981) illustrate a number of similar palstaves in their catalogue. The closest parallels can be seen in the classification Primary shield Pattern Palstaves most probably associated with the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5). The palstave is an early example and is classified as a Group II type which has a mid rib decoration. These group of palstaves date to the Middle Bronze Age period, and can be narrowed down to 1500-1300 BC. There are parallels recorded on the PAS database; for example (WAW-3A6465) was discovered in the Malvern Hills area of Worcestershire. 



The palstave fragment measures 64.1 mm length, is 60.4 mm wide at the blade, 14.9 mm thick at the broken edge. It weighs 146.7 grams.

Description: The object has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentric cutting edge. What is left of the socket is socket is sub-rectangular in cross section.

One of the wide faces has a slight decorative elongated 'H' shaped depression in it. The socketed axe head is a mid matt greenish brown colour with an even, well formed patina which covers most surfaces. There are several areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.

897719,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A Middle Bronze Age ornament hoard, consisting of two Liss arm rings (one in three pieces), an unlooped palstave axe, a quoit-headed pin (in three pieces), a knife/ razor fragment and a fragment of spear tip. The two smaller fragments of arm ring were found c. 3 foot from the rest of the hoard, which was in situ; the two fragments have presumably been moved by the plough.



1) Complete Liss type arm-ring, measuring 83.7mm in diameter (internal diameter 62.1mm), 12.2mm in height and weighing 174g (to the nearest 2g). It is sub-circular/ oval in cross-section (having a width of c.11mm) with an undecorated inside surface. This edge retains much of the original patina which has a high shine, is dark green in colour and very smooth. Much of the rest of the surface is pitter with areas (of varying sizes) of much lighter green corrosion.

The top, bottom and outside surface of the ring has incised linear decoration. Along the top and bottom is a concentric ring of 'herringbone' decoration, comprising integrally stacked chevrons or V-shapes. These chevrons face in an opposite direction along the top to the bottom. The outside surface decoration can be divided into two sections, each occupying half of the arm-ring.

One section can be separated into three areas of decoration, transverse (and ever-so-slightly diagonal) linear incised lines at either end with a middle section of three-and-a half longitudinal lines of herringbone (incised chevron) decoration, the half line being a line of half-chevrons. The two end sections of transverse incised lines are each divided into four sections of roughly equal size (comprising c.10 transverse lines each, but ranging between 8 and 11 lines in some sections). The central divider is a pair of incised herringbone lines, pointing in the same direction (either outwards or inwards) on each face. The remaining two dividers are of 'ladder' decoration, a vertical section with short transverse lines between.

The second section extends from the transverse linear decoration (mentioned above) in the form of a group of larger and closely integrally-stacked chevrons, twenty one side and eighteen on the other. Between is a short zig-zag of four diagonal groups of incised lines in opposing directions (between 12 and 16 lines in each group).



2) Complete Liss type arm-ring, in three pieces. It measures 84.8mm in diameter (internal diameter 63.0mm), 12.1mm in height and weighs 182.81g. It is oval in cross-section (with a width of 10.9mm) and like no.1 is not decorated on the inside surface. This retains a dark brown, high-shine, smooth patina but has many small patches of active corrosion. Likewise the rest of the surface and the broken ends of the object have a large amount of light green corrosion. The decoration appears to take identical form to 1), each half being treated in the same way with similar numbers of incised lines. The three-and-a-half lines of additional herringbone and the ladder decoration also appear in the same places; there is no decorative difference. The surface is however rather obscured by the extensive corrosion.



3) Incomplete quoit-headed pin, in three pieces, including most of the ring-shaped head and two sections of the shank; it is not clear whether any of these pieces join with each other. Its reconstructed length is 241.2mm. The probable tip of the shank is a little bent and the head incomplete, suggesting an estimated original length for these three pieces together is c.250mm. The diameter of the head of the pin is 73.5mm (internal 53.4mm) and it is max.2.1mm thick. The pin shank measures from c.4-3mm in diameter and retains a very shiny, smooth, dark green patina; the head retains a mostly shiny, smooth dark green and coppery-coloured patina but with numerous small patches of light green corrosion. The three pieces weigh 31.33g collectively.

The head consists of a rim 1.6mm thick with a raised rim to either side, 2.1mm tall. Within the shallower area is an incised zig-zag decoration, with the alternate resulting triangles being filled with incised diagonals, parallel to the far-left edge (with the head place uppermost and shank extending downwards). The decorated triangles have their wider end at the outside edge and the undecorated triangles at the inside edge. There are 29 'pairs' of triangles on one side and 22 on the other. The edge of the ring widens from c.8mm where the shanks extends to 11.7mm at the furthest break and 9.9mm at the nearer break; all breaks are old.

The shank extends from the narrowest part of the ring, from a rectangular panel of incised line decoration. On one side this takes the form of a herringbone motif (point towards the internal edge) while the other has crossed diagonal lines extending from either side of the ring and extending into the top of the shank. The shank extends for c.13mm before the old break, where it has an oval cross-section and measures 4.3x3.8mm.

Both sections of shank are circular in cross-section. One narrows from 4.3mm to 3.8mm over 83.6mm while the other narrows from 3.7mm to 3.1mm, at which point much of the external surface of the metal is lost and a wire projection extends 1.8mm in diameter. This section is 74.9mm long.



4) Unlooped palstave belonging to the Norman type. These imports from across the Channel occur in other hoards near Fareham. It measures 154mm in length, 40.9mm wide at the cutting edge, 25.1mm wide and 29.8mm thick at the stop ridge, and weighs 340g (to the nearest 2g). The axehead is complete with some damage to the cutting edge. Where the original patina is visible, it is a silvery-copper colour, shiny and smooth. However the blade and butt end in particular have smaller and larger patches of active light green corrosion.

The blade of the palstave is a long isoceles triangle in shape with expanding sides and a curved cutting edge (where not damaged). In profile the blade is triangular with the widest section being below the stop ridge. Both faces have 'trident decoration' in the form of a triangular- or shield-shaped depression below the stop ridge with a vertical central rib extending from the stop ridge. This central ridge does not extend beyond the shield'.

The butt-end of the axehead is rectangular in shape and triangular in profile. On both faces, the flanges decrease in height from the stop ridge to the butt end.



5) An incomplete blade with no original edges surviving, perhaps from a knife or razor. It measures 28.7mm in incomplete length, 18.1mm in max.width, 2.6mm in max.thickness and weighs 5.09g. The object has a wide central mid-rib, extending in a Y-shape from the wider end (18.1mm wide and max.1.6mm thick) to the narrower end (12.8mm wide and 2.6mm thick). The cross-section at the narrower end is lenticular while it is rather flatter and more rectangular at the wider end. The object has a smooth, shiny, blue-green patina and the breaks, while jagged, are perhaps recentish.



6) A fragment of spearhead blade, measuring 15.9mm in length, max.12.6mm wide, 6.1mm in thickness and weighing 3.05g. It has a greyish-brown patina, silvery in places, smooth and lightly pitted. The object has a pronounced lozengiform cross-section with incurved long edges.","
With special thanks to Brenan O'Connor for recognising the palstave as a Norman type.

The pin is incomplete, missing its lower shaft. This is circular in cross section and widens as it reaches the head from 2mm to 3.5 mm in diameter. The head is 3 mm deep and 11 mm in diameter. It is circular in form and triangular in cross section, emerging from the shaft and widening to form a disc with a concave upper surface which contains a central circular depression. There is no decoration.



Pins of this type are hard to date as they are not often discovered within hoards. The artefact form is likely to be prevalent from the Ornament Horizon (1500 / 1400 BC) through into the Iron Age (at least until 500 BC). The form of the pin is similar to SF-509598, described as a Picardy type and dated to 1400-1250BC and is also similar to examples excavated from Flag Fen (Flag fen cat no 173-185 fig 10.9 pp274-275) these later examples have be dated through metalurgical anaylsis to the Wilburton phases of the later Bronze Age (Needham Period 6) c. 1150-1000 BC.

The axehead is wedge-shaped with a square socket mouth and a moulded everted collar. The remains of four runners / casting jets in the form of raised ovate knops are present - being positioned at the mid-point of each side of the mouth. Internally the socket is wedge shaped - it tapers and narrows to the cutting edge. Externally the sides of the axehead are broadly parallel before expanding to form a crescentic shaped blade with distinct blade tips. On the upper part of the socket is a D-shaped, ovate sectioned attachment loop it is positioned directly below the swollen collar. Casting flashes are present on both sides of the axehead including the loop and a crack is present along one corner. The flashes have been trimmed and hammered flat. Likewise the blade is prepared and sharpened - suggesting the axe was in a condition where it would have been usable.Three distinct vertical ribs are present on the two widest surfaces of the axehead, these commence from the underside of the moulded collar and taper to blunt points on the lower blade before the cutting facet of the axe.



The metal has a largely shiny reddish/brown patina with some green patches on the blade. The area around the socket is slightly blackened while the ribs retain a brassy shine. Peter Reavill Finds Liaison Officer - Herefordshire & Shropshire comments that this is a common feature with the axes seemingly dipped or deliberately blackened, and the ribs then polished resulting in a shiny gold on black effect.

899611,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"A cast copper-alloy miniature flat axe head of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC. Sub-triangular in plan, lenticular in section and in profile. At 101 mm in length the axe is slightly over half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age axe from South-west England. It is 43.5 mm wide at the blade end, tapering to 20 mm near the damaged butt end; its maximum thickness is 9.5 mm and its weight 164.45 g. The sides are straight and do not flare outwards to meet the blade edge which is slightly curved in plan. Much of the original surface has been lost and the axe is pitted and abraded through corrosion and movement within the plough soil. One face is less corroded but there is no evidence of any form of incised decoration on the surface of the axe. The butt end has broken in antiquity to create a central projection which has subsequently worn to a smooth point. The break suggests that part of the axehead was left in the haft or handle which means that it was used.



Pearce (1983) describes a miniature Migdale (Sutherland, Scotland) type flat axe, with a slightly flared blade, from Banner Down, Somerset on page 502, which is illustrated in pl.69, no.587 and a wider, broader Migdale type flat axe with straight sides from Harlyn Bay, Cornwall on page 418, pl.12, no.98c, which are both associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) discuss Migdale flat axes on pp.35-45 and the Biggar variants, with their straighter sides and less rounded cutting edges, on pp.46-48. These are illustrated in plates 5 to 19. A similar small flat axe with straight sides and a shallow curve to the blade, of the Biggar variant type, from Yorkshire, which is the same length, is illustrated in pl.19, no.241.



There are similar miniature Migdale type axes recorded on the database in WMID-58D2F4 and LVPL-DA4598, which is referred to as a 'Biggar' variant of the Migdale type of flat axe, but these have slightly crescentic blades.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996, p.122) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,164.45,,,9.5,101,1,Anna Tyacke,Anna Tyacke,South West,Cornwall,Cornwall,Advent,SX1082,GPS (from the finder),50.60670323,-4.68656202,CORN-3237B8,,DSCN0203.JPG,flat axe (plan),Royal Institution of Cornwall,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/atyacke/DSCN0203.JPG,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1012112.jpg
899615,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"Cast copper alloy fragment of a Bronze Age socketed axe, sub-rectangular in plan and in section and triangular in profile. The fragment consists of the blade end of a socketed axe, 44.5 mm long, 29.5 mm wide at the blade end, 15 mm in height and 4 mm thick at the broken end, and 41.35 g in weight. The entire surface is oxidized to a pale green. The base of the sub-rectangular socket is slightly dished and would have expanded within the axehead as the blade developed into the body and the collar at the opposite terminal. The socket, when complete, would have held the wooden haft or handle of the axe.The almost parallel sides of the fragment are slightly convex, with a faint linear casting seam on each side. The blade is very slightly expanded from the sides of the axe at the cutting edge, which would have been the result of sharpening during use. The cutting edge is rounded and slightly damaged although this appears to be limited to the surface corrosion and is more likely the result of soil movement than of use. The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).

899617,Sword,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-800,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy blade, possibly the point from a Bronze Age sword, kite-shaped in plan and lozenge-shaped in profile. The broken end appears to have been deliberately cut to create a pointed apex which may have been to improve hafting if the fragment was re-used as some sort of perforating tool. This break is not typical of the deliberate breaking up of swords into fragments for deposition, which is often clean and perpendicular to the edge (Matt Knight pers comm). None of the original surface remains, as the fragment is so corroded and pitted from being in the sea, and there is no evidence of any mid rib which is common to Bronze Age swords. It is also very narrow for a sword blade but may come from a narrow Wilburton phase type sword or a blade that is stepped and narrowed in plan like the Carp's Tongue Complex sword, though the latter is not found in Cornwall.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a sword with a narrow blade and point from Weymouth, Dorset, on page 666, pl.105, no.476, which is dated from the Wilburton phase of the late Middle Bronze Age, c.1150-1000 BC.

The vestigial remains of loop are present, with a broken and abraded projection from one lateral face below the stop ridge. Each broad face features corroded rident or shield shaped decoration, cast in low relief below the stop ridge.

900230,Mould,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1200,"Middle Bronze Age bronze mould for casting palstaves of Group III, Low Flanged Type of Taunton Metalworking Industry and probably dated to c. 1400 - 1200BC

The mould is represented by one valve of the pair, with a fragment missing from its base (blade end) (with a length of 197mm and a weight of 510.8g). The mouth (with a thickness of 14mm) is flat on its top surface and is damaged on one side. The exterior of the mould was circular-sectioned at its apex (with a diameter of 43.0mm) becoming hexagonal-sectioned at the neck, which has near straight and parallel sides as far as the position of the loop, where the sides have a rounded swelling, pronounced on the loop side but also present, although subtle on the unlooped side (reaching a maximum width of 54.8mm). The front of the mould has a prominent central groove along the neck (with a maximum depth of 9mm) and corresponding with the septum between the flanges. The mould half reaches a maximum thickness (of 24mm) at the position of the stop. The lower part of the exterior was also hexagonally-sectioned, with straight sides diverging to the base. The basal edge has largely been lost (with a surviving maximum width of 75mm) but appears to have had a gentle curved edge and has a bevel from the face to the edge (9mm thick). The blade part of the exterior was decorated with three divergent ribs, which extended to the basal edge. The surviving part of the basal edge, above the bevel is also enhanced with a rib as is the top of the side bevels. There is a chevron moulding on one side, corresponding with position of the loop.

The interior of the mould has a rounded channel at the apex as a reservoir for the molten bronze (11mm diameter and 26mm deep) feeding into the butt of the palstave. The flat top, where the two mould halves meet is of variable width (from 8.2mm ay the butt and the blade tips and 14.5mm below the loop) and has four locating sockets, to engage with tenons from the missing mould valve. The sockets are of lentoid form (18mm long, 5mm wide and 3mm deep) and with a pair located flanking the butt and a pair beneath the top of the blade. The palstave negative has gently convex sides to the upper part (with a maximum width above the stop of 24.5mm) and the flanges appear to gradually deepen, reaching their maximum height at the stop (where the mould has a depth of 14.4mm). The loop (22mm long, 11 wide, with a mould depth of 5mm and where the palstave has a width of 19mm) is positioned immediately below the stop at its lower end. The stop has a slight curvature. The sides of the blade are curved and divergent to the blade tips, one of which is missing (with a maximum surviving width of 59mm, and the mould has a depth of 2.3mm at the blade edge).The sides of the blade are perpendicular to the blade face, which appear to be moderately flat across its length and width but gradually becomes shallower. There is the suggestion of a groove running along the edge of the blade, perhaps indicating a subtle rib running along the palstave blade edge. The palstave blade would have been decorated with midrib (with a length of 65mm), beginning at the stop. There is an oval casting flaw depression (7mm x 5mm and 1.6mm deep) on the blade, slightly above one of the blade tips.

The interior and exterior faces of the mould have differing corrosion deposits or patinas, the exterior face has a pale brown corrosion deposit which has a tendency to flake off, revealing a pale, 'olive-green' patina. The interior surface has the same or similar brown corrosion over one side and the jet reservoir but elsewhere has a darker-green to black patina. Most of the scratches and striations inside the mould appear to cut through the patina and are likely to be more recent. There is a crack extending from the break on the blade to the side edge, consolidated at Amgueddfa Cymru prior to recording. Palstave moulds are commonly broken across their base or basal corners and Adams (pers. Comm.) has speculated about the possibility of deliberate damage across this area of the mould but suggests that the base is more likely to be a weaker area more susceptible to damage.

The mould would appear to have cast palstaves of Group III, Low Flanged (broad blade) type with a midrib, possibly of Type Sleaford or Type Harlech. The suggested grooves along the sides of the blade may suggest flange extensions, characteristic of Type Sleaford (Schmidt & Burgess, 1981, p133) . Sleaford palstaves are seen as beginning early in the life of broad blade palstaves with an uncertain longevity (ibid.). Broad Blade palstaves are traditionally dated to the Taunton phase of the Middle Bronze Age in Britain, corresponding to Needham's (1996) Period 5, dated to c. 1500 - 1150BC.

Only one other bronze palstave mould find is know from Wales, recovered from Deansfield near Bangor, Gwynedd, which comprised two mould pairs for a looped and unlooped palstave of Middle Bronze Age date. Webley and Adams' (2016) study lists eleven palstave mould finds recorded from Britain, including two locations with associated sets of mould pairs (Deansfield and Hempnall, Norfolk) and nine of which include both valves. Five of the palstave mould finds (from four separate finds) are looped and of Middle Bronze Age date, recovered from London, Deansfield (Gwynedd), two pairs from Hepmall (Norfolk),) and South Wiltshire. Of these finds, only the London mould valve was not decorated on the exterior. An additional palstave mould was recovered from Marton in Shropshire but with no detail recorded. Webley and Adams (2016, p. 324) noted that Later Prehistoric mould finds were absent in South Wales at that time. There has been little recorded Middle Bronze Age activity in the area around the findspot and the suggestion of contemporary metalworking is a significant new addition to our understanding of the Bronze Age of the area.","Metallurgical Analysis of the mould

By Phil Parkes



The bronze palstave mould was analysed using SEM-EDX and XRF analysis to determine metal composition. XRF analysis on the interior and exterior of the mould showed the two surfaces to contain the same elements with slightly different proportions, most likely due to surface depletion / enrichment due to corrosion. SEM-EDX analysis was carried out on a sample taken from the broken edge of the mould using a small hand drill to remove surface corrosion and extract flakes of the uncorroded metal. The analysis showed a bronze (83% copper and 15% tin) with small amounts of lead (0.5%), arsenic (0.8%) and nickel (0.5%) present.



There are clear differences in the composition of the core metal and the interior patinated surface confirmed by both SEM and XRF analysis which are due to surface enrichment effects.



The bronze mould has a number of small areas where a white substance, thought to be a modern clay used to take a cast from the mould, remains. A sample of the modern clay was compared to a sample of the white material removed from the mould for analysis by SEM-EDX. The results show that the two substances are the same (Figure 6) and consist of a fibrous clay-based material with a calcium sulphate (CaSO4) filler.

900449,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,,,"Copper alloy mount or fitting of uncertain function and date, probably of Late Bronze Age or Iron Age date and possibly a scabbard chape.



The possible cast mount is complete (with a length of 23.5mm, a height of 22.9mm and a weight of 18.0g). The mount is of bulbous bi-lobed form (21.5mm wide and 13.1mm thick) with a curving point projecting from each lobe. At the centre is a shallow rounded groove, widest at the base. Both lobes are decorated with prominent ribbing defined by grooves. The lobes terminate in gently curving points of rounded D-shaped section, slightly flattened on their interiors. The points are not decorated and the interior, near the centre is less finished than the rest of the mount. At the centre is an irregular, sub-circular depression or hollowing (6.6mm wide, 7.6long and 4.2mm deep). The interior is not finished and would not have been seen. The surface has a dark-brown patina with orange brown residue or corrosion surviving in the deeper grooves.



The object, often referred to as a 'moustache' is recognised object form but poorly understood in terms of its function and date. The object form is quite consistent, being bi-lobed and rounded, often with ribbed decoration and with projecting prongs. An example of the type was found with the Salisbury Hoard and indicates a Bronze or Iron Age date although the style would suggest a Late Bronze to Iron Age date. It has been suggested that the mount may have been used on Iron Age weapons and it seems possible that the pronged form may be consistent with its use as a scabbard chape, although this remains a conjectural identification.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-02-11T00:00:00Z,,,,18,22.9,,13.1,23.5,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Llantilio Crossenny,SO3915,From a paper map,51.83026815,-2.88660062,NMGW-AF1FCC,,201725copy.jpg,"Copper alloy mount or fitting of uncertain function and date, probably of Late Bronze Age or Iron Age date and possibly a scabbard chape",The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/201725copy.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1012032.jpg
900485,Knife,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Bronze Age knife or razor probably of Late Bronze Age date

The knife or razor is of crescent form and appears to be near-complete but is perhaps missing a tang (with a length of 51.3mm, a height of 40.1mm and a weight of 43.9g). The blade edge is concave with a deep-arched back. The blade tips at both ends may have been elongated, as suggested shallowing to the curve at the back. One tip has a small semi-circular notch (3.3mm diameter), possibly the remnants of a rivet attachment hole and if correct, may suggest a slight tang on that side. There is an irregular long notch (12.5m long and 3.3mm deep) on the top edge, just below the apex and may also be the result of hafting. The blade is thickest at the centre (with a maximum thickness of 4.4mm) and thins at a blade facet on both edges and on both faces. The blade facet has a consistent length (of 7.4mm) along the edge. The surface is more corroded on one face and is dark-green brown with pale. The opposite face has a dark-green patina with a few striations evident running along the blade, possibly from sharpening.



The bronze blade is difficult to closely parallel with British archaeological finds but is perhaps best paralleled with Late Bronze Age Hog backed or triangular knives or Racloirs. The blade edge on these examples is usually comparatively straight rather than concave and perhaps suggests a specialised function. The possible rivet indent on one end and damage to the apex, perhaps suggest a tanged knife with handle on one end but covering the top of the blade.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,2017-03-26T00:00:00Z,,,,43.9,40.1,,4.4,51.3,1,Mark Lodwick,Mark Lodwick,Wales,Monmouthshire,Monmouthshire,Caerwent,ST4789,,51.59733773,-2.76655802,NMGW-B18276,,2017231copy.jpg,Bronze Age knife or razor probably of Late Bronze Age date,The Portable Antiquities Scheme,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/mlodwick/2017231copy.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1012077.jpg
900624,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-600,"Late Bronze Age date (c. 1150-600 BC) pegged spearhead. The copper alloy spearhead is almost complete with the edges of the blade being abraded and the rim of the socket is damaged recently. The blade is a slender leaf-shape and the edges of the blade are slightly bevelled. The midrib tapers towards the tip, which is missing and expands to the socket. The socket is still filled with soil, and is 17.36mm diameter on the interior and 22.03mm diameter on the exterior. The socket is decorated with three bands of triple stranded grooves. On the exterior edges of the outer grooves there is a very fine low-relief zig-zag design. The socket also has a circular perforation on one side, the perforation on the other side is not visible due to corrosion.



The surface of the spearhead has a well-developed shiny dark brown patina.



The spearhead measures 129.77mm in length, 22.03mm diameter at the socket, 27.44mm wide across the blade and weighs 74.45g with soil.



The spearhead is a pegged spearhead which date to the late Bronze Age (c. 1150-600 BC) and are usually found in the Thames Valley, Cambridge Fens and east Midlands.



This spearhead type can be attributed to Davis (2016: 2) Group 11, where he states that Group 11 'represents 72% of the corpus. Attributes are peg holes in the socket and various blade forms e.g. an even curve from blade/socket junction to the tip; a wide curving blade base with blade edges then leading straight to the tip. Overall spearhead length varies considerably from c.100mm to c.400mm. Several have incised decoration on the socket.'

The object consists of a concave butt with tapering sides. It has parallel slightly flanged edges tapering outwards before becoming part of the curved edge of the blade. The blade then tapers gently on either side meeting forming the cutting edge. The object is undecorated though treating with renaissance wax has been attempted resulting in a purple patina. The original patina was brown with green corrosion, and there are traces of green indicating its copper alloy consititution. The blade has pitted badly on both sides and one side of the blade is also badly pitted along the septum and butt end. The object is consistent in form with the Arreton flanged axes, dating to the Metal Assemblage type VI, circa 1700-1500 corresponding to late Early Bronze Age and the early Middle Bronze Age.

902221,Gouge,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-650,"An incomplete copper alloy socketed gouge, of Late Bronze Age dating circa AD 1100 BC to 650 BC.



The object consists of the tip only with the rest of the object missing. The tip has a 'U' shaped blade. The gouge has a circular cross section. The object has tapering sides. The upper edge is damaged an uneven. The tip is narrowed, rounded and slightly flattened. One of the long edges faces is flattened. The opposing side is convex. The gouge has a dark green coloured patina with significant abrasion and pitting on the surfaces.



An incomplete example is recorded on the PAS database which was discovered in Herefordshire (HESH-A48FE1) the description explains how 'Socketed gouges have been found associated with metalwork assemblages of Wilberton (eg. Guilsfield, Savory, 1980, No. 268. 64-65) through Ewart Park (eg Penwyllt, Savory 1980, No 284. 7-8) and Llyn Fawr (Savory 1980, No 291 9-11). Savory (ibid., p 55) suggests that the earliest examples have multiple mouth mouldings, while later examples have a plain or broad, flat collar. According to Pearce in the 1983 publication 'The Bronze Age Metalwork of South Western Britain Part I', page 43, socketed gouges 'appear to have begun in the Wilburton phase, and continued as part of the tool repertoire until the end of the Bronze Age', although she suggests that most socketed gouges can be dated to the Ewart phase between c. 1000 - c. 800 BC'.

902424,Miniature Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1300,-1200,"A complete miniature Palstave of the Middle Bronze Age, dating from c. 1, 300 B.C - 1,200 B.C.



The palstave is broadly rectangular in plan and is lentoid in profile. There are raised ridges on the outer edge of each side forming a H shape in profile at the butt end. The butt is slightly concave and tapers to a rounded rectangular end. Slightly off centre is a raised horizontal mid rib with a three pronged head decoration, forming a trident pattern and two oval depressions in the surface. The blade is triangular and flares out, the cutting edge is visible, and tapers to a sharp edge.



The axehead measures 53.2 mm in length. It is 16.9 mm wide at the blade, 11.7 mm wide at the midrib, and is 7.1 mm wide at the butt end. The object measures 8.6 mm thick at the midrib, the blade is 2.9 mm thick and the butt is 1.8 mm thick. The axhead weighs 17.4 g.



The axhead is a dark green in colour with an uneven patina. Abrasion caused by movment whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



This object seems to be echoing the style of the Early Palstave, Group III, Low flanged (Broad Bladed) axeheads and is very similar to the Wantage type and it's variants. This type has a broad blade and are decorated with a trident pattern, formed by short mouldings branching from the midrib out towards the corners of the stop. Schmidt (1981) writes that although broad bladed, unlooped palstaves are rare in the Marches and Wales there is enough with a trident pattern to view this area as a source for the type (p 133). He also mentions that unlooped, trident palstaves of Type Wantage are among the earliest broad bladed Palstaves to be produced (p 134). He gives a date for the Low flanged (broad blade) Palstaves beginning in the 14th century B.C and extending into the 13th, which puts it firmly in the Middle Bronze Age (1,600 B.C - 1000 B.C). Similar objects have been recorded in Schmidt (1981), Plate 59, Nos 801 - 808 and page 133. However these recorded examples are of larger Palstave axeheads. A direct comparison for a miniature Palstave of this type could not be found at the time of recording.

902633,Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"A gold band with a narrow tang/fastening hook at one end and blunt rounded terminal at one end (with a roughly pierced hole to receive the fastening hook). Both sides of the ornament are folded over to create an overall [ shape (similar to other objects of this date and style, cf. the Binstead 'rings', discussed below). The object has been distorted and crumpled. It is not clear whether the damage occurred before or after deposition, but the latter is probable given the lack of clear or intentional breakage.



Dimensions:



In its current state the object has dimensions of 30mm by 23mm (length by breadth). Measure with a soft tape the object would have had a length of 70mm and a width of c.14-15mm.



Weight: 4.84g



Composition of the gold:



The composition of the gold was tested using non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis. It indicated a surface composition of approximately 88-90% gold and 9-11% silver, the rest being copper.



Discussion:

The function of this band is uncertain. It could be a ring or an ornament with another function. It share features in common with goldwork of probable Middle Bronze Age date, including the substantially larger Capel Isaf (Dyfed, Wales) armlets (Savory 1977), two small interlocked gold 'rings' found at Binstead (West Sussex) (Varndell 1998-9, 10-11, fig. 3) and the Woolaston (Gloucestershire) goldwork hoard (Treasure case 2013 T805, now in the British Museum).

This bead weighs 6.78g. It measures 15.9mm x 14.7mm transversely across the perforation and has a 'height', on the same axis as the perforation, of 9.9mm. The external surfaces of the bead are smooth, polished and undecorated. One side has a small irregular shaped depression at the mid point in the height. This area measures 4.7mm x height 3.1mm and is probably most likely to be the result of a casting imperfection rather than post-production damage.



The perforation is circular in shape with a diameter of 4.9mm on one side. On the opposing side the perforation has a diameter of 5.6mm. Much of the internal perforation wall is cylindrical with relatively vertical sides. However, on the side where there is an external surface depression, the perforation wall is significantly concave. This considerably reduces the thickness of the bead's wall at this location. An area of approximately 1.3mm diameter is so thin that it must have almost broken through to form a hole.



The metal is a relatively dark colour.

904134,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2150,-1150,"TREASURE CASE 2018 T373. Description: An incomplete strip of decorated gold, of probable Bronze Age dating (c. 2150 BC to c. 1150 BC). The strip is an oval/ellipse shaped band that tapers towards the possible terminals. The terminals have a corrugated appearance consisting of three or four peaks and troughs, each created length-ways for approximately one quarter of the object&#39;s length. The central section of the band is undecorated but, like the rest of the object, displays a number of scuffs and striations to both surfaces. There is evidence of a fold at either end of the corrugation and a third diagonal fold across the centre of the object. The finder reported that he unfolded the object himself, thinking at first that it was modern foil.

Dimensions: 53.3mm long, 13.3mm wide, 0.5mm thick, 3.5 grams.

Discussion: It is difficult to identify the object as a particular object type, although it may belong to a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments of Bronze Age date. A number of parallels have been recorded through the Portable Antiquities Scheme (Northfleet, Kent: Treasure Case 2004 T326, Brixton Deverill, Wiltshire: 2006 T250, Gussage-all-Saints, Dorset: 2013 T428, Roche, Corwall: 2014 T39 and Wantage, Oxon 2013 T674). As Dr S. Needham pointed out in the report for Brixton Deverill (2006 T250): &#39;a range of ribbon, or strip ornaments in gold are known from the British Bronze Age, including for torcs, bracelets and small fittings&#39;.

Conclusion: This fragment has a precious metal content of greater than 10% and is, on the balance of probabilities, of prehistoric date.

904784,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1200,-750,"A fragment of cast copper-alloy spearhead, likely dating to the Middle Bronze Age (III) or Late Bronze Age - likely from the Wilburton, Blackmoor / Ewart Park phases. c.1200-750 BC.



Description: The fragment represents most of the spear's upper section and is missing only part of the point. It is long, tapering and narrowing, with a very high angular midrib flanked by moulded channels. The fragment is very warped and bent, typical of intentional 'killed' bronze age objects, leaving it almost S-shaped in profile. On one side of the edge there is another possible intentional bend. The break at the point and towards the butt end are both jagged but worn and patinated. At the butt end break it is shown to be hollow indicating it would have been socketed. The fragment is patinated a dark brown colour with very sparse tiny green speckles. There is a red concretion in parts of the moulded midrib channel.



Measurements: 95.96mm long, 20.35mm wide (at widest remaining), 9.86mm thick (at thickest remaining point) and 33.23g in weight.



Discussion: Peter Reavill (FLO Herefordshire & Shropshire) comments 'Most Bronze Age spearheads are classified by blade shape or socket arrangements - so without those [there will be some uncertainty in classifying this example]. The blade is very large - given that this is just the upper part - so [dating cannot be narrowed further] than very late MBA (III) or LBA - Wilburton, Blackmoor / Ewart Park. so 1200-750. The blade though is very narrow and has a high mid-rib as well as raised flanking mouldings so would guess it is either a Davis Group 9 (1100 -975) Group 16 Lunate blade opening (1100- 800) or a Group 17 channelled blade (950-750). [It is likely that this fragment represents] the top 1/3 of the spearhead, [so when complete would have been a] massive one.



Matt Knight (pers. comms.) from National Museum Scotland has pointed out that the deformation of this object is certainly intentional and occurred when the object was heated, becoming plastic and then struck with a hammer causing some breakage but also the aforementioned deformation. This heated damage also explains why the breaks are not as jagged as one would expect from a cold break.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,33.23,,,9.86,95.96,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,Eastern,Essex,Braintree,Great Yeldham,TL7439,Generated from computer mapping software,52.0221296,0.53454026,KENT-68BED7,,KENT68BED7.jpg,Fragment of huge Bronze Age spear,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENT68BED7.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1015821.jpg

The butt end is rectangular in form and triangular in cross section, with each face having a rectangular shaped recess with a raised border to contain the handle. The blade, which has an elongated triangular cross section, tapers in width from the point it joins the butt. Overall it is 20mm wide and rectangular in form, then flares out to form a curved cutting edge 28mm wide at its flared tip.

The axe has a green patina with green colouration in patches and there are various nicks along the length. The axe is 20mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away and the weight is 171.06g. The axe is warped and may have been miscast. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.

The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops but it has a midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group I type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC.

Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.

The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches

Description:



The fragment survives only as the blade end. The sides curve inwards from the curved crescent blade-edge, flaring in section to a rectangle. The break across the body is irregular. The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to dark brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety.

Description: The fragment survives only as the cutting edge and part of the long rectangular socketed body. The cutting edge survives intact, albeit heavily worn and runs in a very shallow convex curve, the blade tips flare slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaing body appears to be undecorrated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure althoguh part of a casting seam. The axhead is patinated a mid green and the breaks have lead to more extensive corrosion.

907145,Armlet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A copper alloy armlet or bracelet probably dating from the Later Bronze Age, about 1000 BC - 800 BC. It is a penannular loop with flared, expanding terminals. These are close together, leaving a gap of only about 4-6mm between them. Each terminal is circular and the ends are concave or hollow. The inner face of one terminal is rough and corroded and has gravel adhering to the concretion. The outer sides of the terminals are straight, flaring from the armlet hoop to the widest point of the terminals at the very end. The hoop is mainly D shaped in cross section and varies in diameter. It is c.12mm diameter immediately behind the terminals, swelling to c.18mm diameter at the side of the hoop opposite the terminals. The overall plan is D-shaped, the terminals being in the middle of the straight edge. It has been suggested that the original shape of the bracelet has been changed, as the terminals are unusually close to each other. There are some short shallow grooves on the inside of the hoop, near one of the terminals, and parallel to the end of the terminal. These are worn and patinated. The surface is mainly smooth and worn, with a few small pits, and has a turquoise green patina, with some areas of golden olive green. The armlet is 113.4mm long, 88.8mm wide (from terminals to the outer side of the hoop) and 24mm thick across the terminals. The internal measurements are 83.2mm long and 48.6mm wide from the terminal to the inner edge of the apex. 362g. The artefact was recovered from a quarry and has been through a washing plant where it would have been scrubbed with sand. This may account for the smooth, worn surface, but the fact that not all the patina has been removed suggests that it was a well developed patina originally. The small areas of olive green colouration may indicate the original colour.



This object could also be a Post Medieval to Modern West African manilla or currency bar such as WMID-22DE66, LANCUM-41B6C5 or LIN-E37002, but all of these previously recorded on the PAS database have solid, teardrop shaped terminals, and a more open, horseshoe like shape in plan. However, it remains a possibility that this is a manilla of different style. The depth and uniformity of the patina argues against this interpretation.



A good parallel but in gold rather than copper alloy is HAMP-5E48D1. Photographs of the copper alloy armlet were sent to several specialists. Adam Gwilt (National Museum of Wales) suggested that there is a tendancy for bronze versions of objects that are usually gold to be more common in Western and Northern Britain and provided a reference that touches on this: Gwilt et al (2005) A Late Bronze Age Hoard from Trevalyn Farm, Rossett, Wrexham, with Some Obvervations on Hoarding Practice and Gold Bracelet Weights"" in Studia Celtica XXXIX (2005), pages 27 - 61. He also noted that the squashed oval form looked atypical and suggested that the terminals may have been pushed inwards, perhaps deliberately before deposition. He suggested that the shape of the terminals are possible for the Late Bronze Age, though this example has chunky proportions.



Julia Farley (British Museum) agreed that the patina was plausibly Bronze Age or Iron Age, and Neil Wilkin (British Museum) was also prepared to entertain a Late Bronze Age date, citing a pair of slightly more slender copper alloy pennannular bracelets with expanded terminals recovered in a cache of Late Bronze Age (Ewart Park / Carp's Tongue) metalwork at Minster in Thanet, Kent which were excavated in 2010 - 2011 (MOLA Excavation Report: 'Prehistoric and Roman settlement at Tothill Street, Minster in Thanet, Kent' downloaded from www.kentarchaeology.org.uk). He did point out that the terminals are closer together than the Thanet examples, and the shape is more kidney-shaped.



In conclusion, this object is likely to be a Late Bronze Age armlet that has been distorted, perhaps deliberately, and one that has been made in copper alloy rather than the more usual gold.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Other chance find,2018-05-21T23:00:00Z,2018-05-21T23:00:00Z,,,362,,,24,113.4,1,Amy Downes,Amy Downes,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Harrogate,North Stainley with Sleningford,SE3076,From finder,54.17891154,-1.54186705,SWYOR-B6E981,,3171_Armlet_1.jpg,Late Bronze Age armlet,West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/3171_Armlet_1.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1017687.jpg

907324,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2250,-1900,"A very worn and incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age date (c. 2200 - 2000 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub triangular in plan with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slightly tapering edges. In cross section the axe is rectangular. One long edge is curved and the opposite is relatively flat. 



The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. A distinct blade facet is not present; it has been lost through abrasion. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe. However, almost all of the original patina has been lost through laminating corrosion.  The axe is a mid green colour; where damage has occurred there is a light green active corrosion product present. The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge). Closest parallel is no 67, discovered at Hill of Finglenny. The axe is similar in size to HESH-ACD6C1 which is described as potentially small in length. 



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

The axe head comprises a curved, fan shaped cutting edge, which has suffered damage and corrosion. This tapers back in a curve to the stop ridge, before levelling out to form the rest of the axe. There is a prominent vertical rib running down the centre of the blade on both faces, from the stop ridge, to within approximately 20mm from the blade's edge, this is mirrored by two slighter ribs running either side, along the blades edges. Casting seams are visible along both sides of the axe head. Just below the stop ridge are traces of where the loop would have been situated. Below the stop ridges, on either side, are very slight flanges, which taper and then disappear towards the butt of the object. The area between these flanges is slightly curved in profile, with trace of an unidentied material on one side. Areas of the axe head are delaminating, with flaking on parts of the surface.","

Sub-rectangular copper-alloy sheet with three riveted holes spaced approximately 5.6-5.8mm apart from one another. It is likely that this item (along with no 9) forms part of a fitting, possibly a pommel fitting. There is one straight unbroken edge, and a curving edge which shows evidence of breakage on one side. The underside is worn and slightly concave, curving inward closer to the edges. The upper surface is smooth with a dark green patina. It was considered that this could be part of the shaft of a socketed knife, but the straight edge and the relative thinness of the artefact would suggest a plate fitting function, rather than being a fragment of a cylindrical item.

Copper-alloy socketed gouge or chisel of Late Bronze Age date. The tool is rounded at the butt portion though a rectangular shaped section is still visible, particularly when viewing the inside of the artefact. At the butt end the corners are much more rounded. Tapering toward the chisel point, the corners of the rectangular shaped tool become much more defined. The wider sides taper to a sharp triangular point, which meet the terminal of the shorter sides perpendicularly, forming a straight edge, creating a wedge like, sharp terminal. The socket rim is slightly flared and thicker on the edge. The external patina is dark green and generally smooth.

The spear can probably be assigned to Davis's Group 7 'Special Side Looped'. The object has a broken blade of indented quadrilateral section. There is a prominent longitudinal mid-rib on both sides of the spear blade and abraded cutting edges. Approximately one third of the blade has been broken off. The socketed end of the spear measures 15.76mm in diameter. The single side loop towards the base of the socketed end has since broken away. There is a hole on one face of the object in the centre of the of the blade wings at the base, which appears to have been formed through corrosion in antiquity. Much of the original surface has corroded and is lost; however, that which survives has a dark brown patina. The remainder of the object has a mottled dark-mid green patina.

The chape is sub triangular or ogival in shape, and lozenge shaped in cross section. At the open end the chape curves upwards into two convex arms, creating a crescent shape. The outside edges curve down gradually to half way down the chape, before narrowing at a more steep angle. The chape terminates with a rounded knop, at the end of which is a circular hole and rivet to attach the knop. Running down the centre of the chape on both sides is a raised ridge, this slopes gradually down to the edge of the chape, this is raised round the outside edge of the object. On both sides at half-length there is a circular perforation to the right of the raised central ridge. The inside of the chape is hollow.

910010,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1400,"An incomplete cast copper-alloy palstave axe dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. BC 1600-1400). The palstave is near-complete with only part of the broken butt missing. The palstave is roughly sub-rectangular in shape and flattens and flares outwards to form a wide rounded blade, giving the object a slender elongated sub-oval shaped cross-section. The butt is H-shaped in section and terminates towards the centre of the axe with shallow rounded stop-ridge and a peltate-shaped recess on both sides at right angles to the septum. The flanges are flat, sub-oval in plan, straight and parallel and extend all the way to the butt, with a central longitudinal casting ridge, one with a flattened globular miscast patch towards the cutting edge. The blade gradually flattens and to form a wide cutting edge that is heavily worn and pitted. One side of the blade is heavily pitted and scratched and has patches of green patina and iron-corrosion across sections of the flange and especially the recessed section of the butt. The opposite side of the axe is less corroded but has a wide diagonal scratch extending from the cutting edge to the adjacent flange.



The palstave axe measures 142mm in length. The blade is 61mm wide and 2mm thick at the cutting edge and the butt 22mm wide and 10mm thick and its end, and 22mm wide and 26mm thick at the stop. The axe weighs 325.13 grams.



This palstave shares characteristics with Group 1 Primary Shield Pattern palstaves from the Acton Park 1 of Bronze Age metalwork (as of Schmidt & Burgess 1981).

910443,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"A small copper alloy, perhaps miniature or 'model', Middle Bronze Age palstave axehead of Schmidt and Burgess 'unclassified low-flanged palstave' type with broad blade (group III) and without side loop, belonging to the Taunton phase of metalworking and corresponding to Needham's period 5, 1500-1150 BC. The flanges are a little worn (old damage) but the object is otherwise complete.

From the central stop ridge (13.5mm wide, 13.3mm thick) the blade has gently expanding straight sides, curving into a broad but flattish cutting edge 19.8mm wide (with possible old damage to one corner). Directly below the stop ridge on one face is a small hole 1.7mm deep, probably a bubble from the casting process. Below and running to the cutting edge are faint traces of a worn and wideish mid-rib. There are possible traces of this to the other face but it is not certain.

Above the stop ridge the butt end widens a little and narrows to 14.9mm x 1.9mm at the end, which is worn. The stop ridge projects 3.7mm above the butt end on either side.

The object measures 74.5mm in length, 19.9mm in max.width, 13.2mm in max.thickness and weighs 46.96g. The metal is dark grey in colour with some green patches, and is pitted on both faces. No casting flashes are visible to the sides of the object.

It is uncertain whether this object is a miniature axe intended for use (it seems rather small for axe-purpose but could have functioned as a wood-working too perhaps) or perhaps had use as a votive object; it is larger though in its 'model' form similar to miniature socketed axes (for eg. HAMP-657353) thought to have an amulet or votive function and believed to date between the Bronze Age to the Roman period (Robinson, P; 1995).",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,46.69,,,13.2,74.5,1,Katie Hinds,Katie Hinds,South East,Hampshire,East Hampshire,Rowlands Castle,SU7212,From finder,50.90299451,-0.97743794,HAMP-C8A4F8,,HAMPC8A4F8.jpg,Middle Bronze Age miniature palstave,Hampshire Cultural Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/khindshamp/HAMPC8A4F8.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1020417.jpg

One face and two sides of the axehead retain much of the original shiny, smooth olive green-brown soloured patina. Elsewhere, where the patina is lost, the metal is rough, heavily pitted, and a blueish-green in colour. 

The blade is triangular in shape, the long edges a little in-curved and the cutting edge expanded (51.2mm wide). Visible on the face retaining its original patina, the cutting edge is bevelled and above this are shallow hammer markings/ workings. There is a little damage to one end of the cutting edge.

The stop ridge measures 24.2mm wide and 32.3mm in depth. Below this, and continuing as a line from the flange edges above, a rib on either side converges in a point at the top of the blade to give a triangular shield-shape. Just below the stop ridge, the top of the blade is waisted and measures 22.5mm wide and 24.5mm thick.

Above the stop ridge the flange edges running along the butt end of the axe slope upwards to a point c. one third of the way along the butt end before sloping downwards again for another third of the length where the flange becomes level with the butt end. At their highest point, the flanges have a depth of 36.9mm; however only one of these points survives undamaged so it is likley the original depth was c.38mm. Originally, the flanges would have had a distinctive lozengiform shape. To one side of the axehead these are badly damaged and motly missing (old damage). The butt end is 19.4mm wide and 6.6mm thick. One corner is missing (old damage).

To the sides of the axehead the casting flashes are visible in places, worn smooth. To one side, a pair of longitudinal grooves are visible just below the butt end. It is uncertain whether these are decorative or the remant of a worn casting flash.

The length from the butt end to the stop ridge is c.61mm. It is max.14.1mm deep (behind the stop-ridge - there is also a deepish hole at this point, a possible casting flaw) and 15.8mm wide inside the flanges behind the stop.

The axehead measures 145.1mm in length, max. 51.2mm wide (cutting edge) and 36.9mm thick (stop ridge). It weighs 384g (to the nearest 2g).

The palstave has an old, irregular break at the butt. The septum is gradually thickens from 3.0 mm at the butt to 7.4 mm before the stop. The septum is 54.2 mm in length and 24.4 mm in width. The flanges gradually widen from the butt to the stop to a maximum of 31.4 mm on one side and 29.6 mm on the other side, creating a triangular shape in profile. The stop is angled forwards slightly at its centre and is thicker than the flanges at the centre at 31.3 mm. An integral loop survives on one side and measure 21.9 mm in length. The loop starts before the widest part of the flange and continues towards the blade side. On the other side, diametrically opposite to the loop and near to the flange top, is a shallow hole. The hole measure 4.7 mm in the inner diameter.



The elongated, narrow blade is sub-rectangular in section with curved sides that widen gradually towards the blade, before curving out at the blade tips to meet the convex curve of the blade edge. The blade thins from the stop to the edge. The broad faces of the blade are noticeable convex with a central ridge projecting down the blade from the stop. The blade is 62.0 mm in length from the stop ridge to the cutting edge and 21.7 mm in width across the stop ridge. The cutting edge is 35.9 mm in width and 2.8 mm in thickness, it is chipped and any edge bevel is now unclear.



The palstave appears plain and with a green-brown patina all around. Traces of the original surface remains on the loop, on the stop ridge and on one side of the blade.



The palstave measures 123.8 mm in length and weights 245.9 g.



The palstave dates in general to the Middle Bronze Age. The side loop and a much narrower blade tending towards oval in cross section suggest a late dating, from BC 1300 to 1150. A similar example from Salcombe, Devon (Knight, Ormod, Pearce 2015, no. 163b) is dated along with other materials from AC 1300 to 1150.

The object is a butt riveted small blade dagger or knife with triangular blade. The blade would have been attached to the hilt by means of three large rivets, the top side one is still in place. The rivet is circular in cross-section and flat-hourglass-shaped in plan. The other two are missing and the other rivet holes are incomplete due to breaks or possibly corrosion. The object is quite damaged so it is difficult to ascertain the exact type, but it is similar to Needham's series 2 (id 1200 Carder Low Type 2B or 1204 Parsley Hay Type 2A) or a series 7 (ID 1260 Thomas Hardye School Type 1 B4/7A). The condition of the object is reasonably good. It is patinated dark green/brown with damage to the blade and the top is missing. The length is 50mm, the width is 28mm (photos from finder).



Similar in form to SF9298 though larger which itself is similar to examples from Shrewton, Wilts (associated with a pommel and a beaker) and Driffield, Yorks which was associated with a beaker, stone wristguard with gold rivet caps and two amber buttons.



EBA daggers are rare in the north (and very rare in the northwest) - and are high status EBA funerary artefacts usually found in barrows (Ben Roberts pers com 24.07.18).

The axe in length is 148mm, the width is 55mm thickness 55mm wide and there are no traces of casting flashes on the flange facets which must have been filed away. The axe share similarities with, NMGW-D73AD4 and NMGW-FAACD2.

The palstave shares typological features with Group I and Group II palstaves, the primary forms introduced to Britain in the Middle Bronze Age (Schmidt and Burgess 1981). As there are no side loops or midrib, this palstave may be relatively early, probably a Group II type from the Acton Park phase of Bronze Age metalwork, c1450-1300BC.

Schmidt and Burgess tell us that the term 'palstave' is misleading, as it comes from the Icelandic 'Paalstab' meaning a digging tool, not a type of axe. The term is used in British archaeology to describe an axe where there is a stop and the flanges disappear into the stop. Palstaves are also thicker below the stop. They are usually decorated on the blade and, as time went on, developed loops. Group I palstaves have a shield-like decoration below the stop ridge and variable flanges.

The concentration of palstaves in the North West of England is explained by the proximity to the Acton Park province, the major production area in north Wales and the Marches

Description: The fragment survives only as the blade end. The sides begin to curve inwards from the curved crescent blade-edge, flaring in section to a rectangle. The broken edges are heavily worn likely indicate breakage in antiquity although the variation in patination may indicate it happen while in the ground. The break across the body is irregular. The surface of the axe is heavily mottled dark to light green to light brown in patina and is heavily pitted by corrosion across its entirety. It looks like it was not faceted or had a ribbed decoration.

916046,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"Copper alloy socketed axe head. Cast socketed single looped axe head, lightly flared towards its crescentic curved cutting edge. The plain narrower upper and lower sides each bear a clear central mould line; the other broader sides are flat and plain. At c.50mm in from the cutting edge, narrow grooves of width c.4.5mm appear at the arises where flat sides meet, and these continue until 5mm before the edge of the socket. This appears square with rounded corners externally, framing a rounded aperture measuring 27mm in both directions and with a thickened triangular section border. A single loop of length 17.5mm, width 6.5mm and height [i.e. protrusion] 7mm is set on one narrower side adjacent to the socket, with the mould line noted above continuing along it. Most of the object bears an appealing brownish patina; this has suffered only limited disruption by localised damage on one broader side, and is more extensively removed from the other, where a deeper dent also appears, presumably the result of plough strike. A chocolate brown material with an orange tinted stain where it is lost appears around the inner side of the mouth of the socket, and might even represent the otherwise decayed wood of a haft. The cutting edge remains sharp. The thickened socket mouth, which is amply reinforced at the point which would receive more stress than any other, adds to the general impression of a viable tool which remained fully functional at the time of its deposition. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC.

916429,Strap Fitting,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1600,-100,"A complete copper-alloy strap fitting of possible middle Bronze Age to Iron Age date, c. 1600 - 100 BC.



The object comprises a pointed ovate body with a D-shaped section which tapers in thickness from one end to the other. The upper terminal is swollen with a wide, rounded upper end which is decorated with two parallel incised D-shaped borders. The front of the swollen portion of the body has a central lozenge shaped recess extending from the point at which the two borders meet on the upper edge to midway along the front of the body. The recess is at its widest where the body bends from the rounded top to the front. The sides of the body curve inward slightly as they extend and narrow to form the rounded lower terminal.



An integral rectangular attachment loop is present to the reverse of the wide upper terminal and the reverse of the fitting is slightly concaved.



The metal has a dark green patina and is worn. The object is 25.3mm long, 16.3mm wide, 9.8mm thick (17.6mm with attachment loop) and weighs 11.6g.



This fitting has features in common with a fairly frequently found yet poorly understood object type currently known simply as 'moustache' or 'moustache-like' objects. See: YORYM-9432BB, LIN-9296A3, WMID-CA9D04 and BH-037A57. Such objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the early Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard. Dr JD Hill (British Museum) suggests that they are Iron Age objects, but this is yet to be confirmed by excavation of a stratified example.



SUR-29CED6 and SUR-4F8D51 are more similar to the current example. While both are described as 'a fragment of a moustache object' they appear to be complete.

917277,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1400,-1125,"A nearly complete cast copper alloy spearhead dating to the Middle Bronze Age (1400 BC - 1125 BC).



The spear blade is leaf shaped, with loops incorporated into the base. This is known as a basal-looped spearhead. The blade is now broken into two pieces, roughly half way down with a diagonal break. Most of the outer edge of the blade is abraded, except around the tip where it is complete. The centre of the blade is divided by an expanding (tip to base) lozenge sectioned midrib. This midrib expands into the socket of the spear. Conjoined at the base of the blade are two oval shaped loops. When viewed in profile, the outer edges of the loops (loop plates) are lozenge shaped. The socket is conical in shape, the lower edge of which is slightly damaged and missing a small section. There is remains of wood inside the socket.



The metal is dark brown in colour, with an uneven but polished patina. The tip is 98.6 mm long, 33.9 mm wide and 13.9 mm thick at the midrib. The second piece is 172.7 mm long and 39.4 mm wide. The base of the socket is 23.9 mm by 22.5 mm. The tip weighs 57.6 g and both pieces together weigh 191 g.



Middle Bronze Age spearheads have been categorised by Davis (2017) and this example falls into Group 8: Incorporated basal looped. He notes that spearheads of the later MBA were generally larger, as well as having loops at the base of the blade. They are dated by associated to the Taunton and Penard phases (1400 BC - 1125 BC).



Further examples have also been recorded on the PAS database, including BERK-AAB536, HESH-CB1BF7, SF-54C472 and DENO-DC8D26.

Discussion:

The objects that make up this find are all typical of Ewart Park phase hoards (c. 900-800 BC) in the south-east of England. The composition of the hoard and the scrap-like (fragmentary) condition of the objects is comparable to others found in Kent (see Turner 2010 for fexamples). The shape and size of ingot (No. 1) is notable and relatively unusual, as is the presence of a bracelet fragment (No. 30), although it can be paralleled, for example, in the hoard from Minnis Bay, Isle of Thanet (Ibid.).

Conclusion: 

As a single find of more than two prehistoric objects of copper alloy, this find (consisting of objects Nos. 1-30) qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 (Designation Order 2002","Please note that soil adhered to many of the objects and the weights cannot be taken as final.&nbsp;

The larger fragment comprising roughly a quarter of the upper shaft is broadly trapezoidal in plan and wedge-shaped in profile. The axe has a double mouth moulding which is very worn. The surviving body of the axe is broadly rectangular with gently tapering sides. On one face there is a semi-circular shaped loop with an oval perforation infilled with deposition residue. The fragment is broken along the upper casting seam but unevenly along the other sections of the body. The fragment measures 40mm in length, a maximum of 26mm in width at the socket end and is 5.5mm thick. It weighs 27.80 grams.



The smaller fragment is a broken section of the axe's sub-square shaped socketed body. The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan and broadly rectangular in section, and is angled at one end. The small fragment does not attatch in any obvious way to the larger fragment but the material and composition indicate that they are both from the same object.

918540,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"A complete copper alloy miniature flat axe or possibly a chisel, 59.5mm in length and dating to the early to late early Bronze Age (2050 BC- 1700BC).



The axe has straight sides, expanding into a cutting edge, which is curved and 26mm across, with a cutting edge around 1mm thick. The butt end narrows to 15.1mm in width and is slightly convex. There are no flanges or other features. The profile of the axe is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval with a maximum thickness at the centre of 7.3mm. The surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy - suggesting a date after the very earliest period when axes were made of copper rather than bronze","This object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg.HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).



Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.

918988,Penannular Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-750,"A gold-plated copper alloy penannular 'lock ring' of Late Bronze Age date. The ring consists of a central core in copper alloy covered by sheets of gold: one on the front and the back of the ring and one on the inner side. This inner sheet is now detached from the core and irregularly folded, whilst the edges of the first sheet on one side are lifted. The gold sheet is decorated on both surface with seven concentric incised lines following the shape of the ring.



The ring is C-shaped in plan with a gap of 2.7 mm. It is and triangular in cross-section, with a flat inner side, flat surfaces and a prominent external rim. It is worn with several blackened spots along the sheets of gold.



The ring measures 24.9 mm in diameter and weighs 5.01 g.



Gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) and they could have been used as hair-rings or earrings and are often found in pairs. They are usually decorated with repousse' decoration or with fine concentric incised lines imitating fine wire works. More rarely, lock-rings are made from plates obtained from individual gold wires soldered together.



A close parallel is BERK-4A433E (2016 T106) dating to 1150-800 BC. Another similar parallel but without copper alloy core is no. W.20 in British Museum Collection, dating to BC 1150-750.","This item was found before 1996 and therefore as there is no evidence it was buried with the intention to recover it would not be classed as Treasure under the pre-1996 law (ie the law of Treasure Trove).

920359,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1600,-1300,"A complete cast copper-alloy flanged axehead, dating from the Early to Middle Bronze Age (c.1400-1250 BC). This object is probably a Schmidt and Burgess Type Ulrome, No. 542 (1981: plate 43).



The axehead is sub-rectangular in plan with a narrow, squared butt end which is wedge-shaped in section, tapering at the terminal. There are four individual flanges, on the front and back of the axehead and either side. The flanges start near the butt end, where they gradually curve upwards in profile and are thicker in section towards the crest. The crest of the flanges are a rounded point. After the crest, each flange becomes thicker in section and slopes downwards in profile, more abruptly compared to the other side of the crest. This side of each flange is curved inwards to the centre of the object, with a slight internal ridge. On the exterior profile of the flanges, on both sides of the axehead, there are two lengthwise ridges which run along the base of each flange, tapering towards the butt end. The flanges terminate approximately mid-way along the body of the axehead. Although there is a lack of a defined stop ridge to secure the handle, there is a slight ridge which starts at the end of the thicker, curved side of the flanges and it is curved towards the butt end. This curved ridge is more apparent on one side of the axehead than the other, due to the level or corrosion on this object. The side with the more clear curved ridge, also has two ridges which start at the end of the flanges and form a point, facing the blade end of the object. These ridges, along with the curved ridge, form a triangle with a curved base shape on the body of the axehead. After the flanges, the body of the axehead gradually widens in plan and curves outwards, relatively close to the terminal of the blade end. The section of the body gradually tapers towards the blade end. The plan of the blade is crescent shaped and is chipped in several places along the blade edge.



The axehead is in a fair condition, with most of the detail and dark green patina being visible. The surface of the object is pitted with evidence of active bronze disease and has some patches of orange-brown.



It is 132.81mm in length, 47.33mm in width at the blade end, 22.27mm in width at the butt end, 30.84mm thick at the flanges and 13.48mm thick at the mid-pont of the body.



Another flanged axehead which is similar to this object was recorded by the Durham Portable Antiquities Scheme: DUR-41AE2E. Other examples on the PAS database include: IOW-DC1AD8; LANCUM-B39815; SWYOR-BAA720; and DENO-D22101. This axehead is possibly Schmidt and Burgess Type Ulrome, with No. 542 being the closest parallel as it has the same profile shape and has similar ridges on the body, a triangle with a curved base, as well as the ridges on the side of the flanges match this object (1981: plate 43).

Octagonal-sectioned socketed handle with two rivet holes positioned on the long axis on each face, now filled with corossion product. Within the socket is a fragment of wood, traces of a white substance, possibly adhesive (or wax) and a ring of corrosion product running around the mouth. The handle tapers slightly from a width of 25.5mm to 21.5mm before expanding into the shoulders to a maximum width of 42.1mm. The junction between the integrally cast blade and the hilt is stepped on both faces, with a central U-shaped cut out in the centre of the hilt. The blade tapers in width along its length from 41.2mm to 25mm, terminating in a transverse break. It has a lenticular cross-section with a pronounced median rib on both faces. The long edges are heavily abraded. The sword exhibits a smooth dark brown patina, with green patination along the edges, around the area of the break and areas which appear to have been abraded due to movement in the plough soil.

The object is a single cast chisel with a flat terminal that widens towards the middle of the piece before tapering down to a point. The wider end terminates in a worn break, and is slightly bent inwards. The point is likely the tang of the object to be inserted into a wooden handle, and is roughly square in section. There is a slightly thicker collar below the tang. The object is undecorated, is mid to dark green in colour and has an uneven patina. Abrasion, caused by movement within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some original surface detail.



Small chisels and tools of this type were used for an extensive period of time, not simply in the Bronze Age, but also in later periods for jewellery making and fine work. As such dating the object is difficult.

Discussion



Similar examples recorded on the PAS database include: BERK-CCF74B; NMGW-FE5523; and BERK-CF2C22. 



Owing to the size of the fragment it in unclear what type of blade this object was attributed to and how long the original item would have been. However, as Domscheit (2014) discusses, 'Although swords have origins in the later part of the Middle Bronze Age of Taunton and Penard Metalworking Industries, occurrences of the types are comparatively unusual and leaf-shaped swords of Late Bronze Age date tend to be more commonly recovered'.

921483,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-700,"Fragment of a cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been circular in plan and plano-convex in profile. This fragment is square in plan, triangular in profile, and rectangular in section, as it comes from one edge of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers' hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The fragment is sub-rectangular in plan, sub-rectangular in profile, and triangular in section. The fragment is hollow with an internal triangular recess tapering to a point towards the cutting edge. The edges and faces of the axehead fragment are smooth and precise. The break is uneven and runs diagonally down the body of the axehead. Unfortunately not enough remains of the axehead to be able to identify it more precisely or attribute a closer date.

921640,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1050,-950,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) palstave axe with side loop and three decorative ribs. It is most probably from the period 1050-950 BC which fits with Wilburton and Penard assemblages of the later Middle and earlier Late Bronze Age; this corresponds with Needham (1996) Period 5-6 fitting with Metalworking Assemblage X. The axe is relatively diminutive (small) when compared to most palstaves being broadly rectangular in plan and ovoid in profile. The blade of the palstave has straight sides that flare to form a crescent shaped cutting edge. The rear part of the axe (from the stop ridge to the butt) is sub-rectangular in plan and sub-triangular in section (profile). The butt of the axe has been damaged and is incomplete; although only a small part has probably been lost. The two sides flare progressively from the butt to the raised and thickened stop. The flanges are fused to the stop and the septum of the axe is smooth and undecorated. The casting seams and associated flashes on either side (long edge) have been trimmed and hammered flat. An integrally cast side loop descends on one edge; it is positioned astride the stop. The loop is D-shaped in cross-section. Below the stop ridge of the axe on the upper blade are three ribs - a central one and two tapering ones; these descend from the thickened stop and taper to an undefined edge at the mid-part of the upper blade. The ribs are present on both faces - although are better defined on one. The palstave has a well-defined polished mid-green coloured surface patina which is relatively well preserved. A small amount of surface abrasion and corrosion is present - mostly limited to the external edges. The break across the butt is patinated with a slightly lighter green patina suggesting damage in antiquity but more recent than deposition. More recent plough damage is visible on each surface but especially on the cutting edge, the loop and one face of the blade.



The palstave axe fits well with those known from the later period - most specifically defined as 'later palstaves' due to its size it is difficult to align it with a sub type - although it does have the majority of the traits identified as Type Isleham or more probably Type Nettlesham (after Burgess & Schmidt). This type is relatively uncommon with only a few examples being recorded on the PAS database. Good parallels can be seen from Hockenhul, Cheshire (LVPL-B27017) and also a mixed hoard of Late palstaves and socketed axes from Amport, Hampshire (HAMP-4DE734 etc). The nature of this hoard suggests this form of decorated axe has a potentially long life (well into the Ewart Park phase of the later Bronze Age (1000-750 BC).



The palstave measures: 152.5mm length, is 44.3mm width across the blade, 20.5mm width across the butt, the axe is 36.4mm thick across the stop and the septum is 6.7mm thick at the butt. The side flanges raise to a height of 6.7mm above the septum and the stop is 11.7mm.

The blade tip is missing, the socket and base of the blade remain, the blade terminating in an old break 30.8 mm from the blade-socket junction. The midrib is lozenge-shaped in cross-section. On either side of the midrib are deep channels. The blade wings are broadly triangular in cross-section.. The ribs do not extend onto the socket. The socket is circular in cross-section, it tapers slightly from 22 mm at the base to 19 mm at the blade socket junction, where it becomes more eliptical in cross-section. Near the rim of the socket are the broken lugs for two loops placed roughly opposite each other, in line with the blade wings. The tip of the wooden shaft of the spear survives in the socket. The object has a pitted surface and a olive green/brown patina with light green and brown patches.



Overall length 92 mm, width 31 mm, thickness 10.5 mm, Weight 80.8 g.



Stylistically, the spearhead fits into Davis Group 2 Socketed Type B Looped. Richard Davis says: ""The key attributes ... are the V-shaped base to the blade as it merges with the socket. The midrib does not follow the line of the socket, but is narrower than the socket as it enters the V. There is a channel each side of the midrib as it leads to the raised blade wings. The loops are low on the socket. There is a characteristic inward curve of the profile from above the socket to the blade. ... These spearheads represent the first stage of combining the blade with the socket. They are dated to the Arreton Phase 1700-1550 BC based on hoard evidence. Finds of Group 2 spearheads are rare. [Davis'] PBF catalogue comprises 8 with pegholes and 22 with loops. The only local finds from the Group are one with a peghole, dredged from the River Trent at Colwick (Castle Museum collection): and one with loops purchased from a car boot sale and believed to have come from the Trent gravels (DENO-DC4C87)."" pers. comm. 31/10/2018.",,3,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,80.8,,,10.5,92,1,Simon Nicholson,Simon Nicholson,East Midlands,Nottinghamshire,Newark and Sherwood,Langford,SK8356,From finder,53.09476293,-0.7619784,DENO-0A5A41,,DENO0A5A41.jpg,Middle Bronze Age Ribbed Kite Blade spearhead,Derby Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/awillis/DENO0A5A41.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1032415.jpg

Discussion:



The earliest bronze hammers were created in the Middle Bronze Age Taunton metalwork phase, however hammer finds are more defined in Late Bronze Age hoard discoveries. Socketed hammers became more widespread in the Penard phase (c1200-950BC), and according to Burgess this tradition lasted longer in the North of Britain whereas the characteristics of the Wilburton Phase were prominent in southern Britain during the tenth century BC. Hammers were produced in smaller numbers during the Ewart-Park Phase which is characterised by a higher volume of leaded bronze artefacts. The production of bronze and in particular tin bronze depleted after 800BC. Burgess (1968) describes two socketed hammers from the Kilnhurst hoard in Yorkshire, one short and the other long which is similar to the example here. Early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding. The example described here is more likely a later example in the Penard Phase. Burgess also parallels Penard metalwork to continental examples and in particular western France.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,51.7,,,13.11,61.48,1,Ellie Cox,Ellie Cox,East Midlands,Northamptonshire,South Northamptonshire,Hartwell,SP8051,From finder,52.15149812,-0.83215728,NARC-5B738E,,NARC5B738E.jpg,NARC-5B738E : Hammer : Bronze Age,Eleanore Cox,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/elliecox05/NARC5B738E.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1030945.jpg

This fragment is square in plan, triangular in profile, and rhomboidal in section, as it comes from one edge of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1150-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers' hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

The object is now sub rectangular in form and oval in cross section, it is a sheet that has been rolled around itself at least four times and appears to be incomplete. At the visible end it is 14mm wide and very thin less than 0.25mm thick. It is decorated with a series of seven raised rectangular cross sectioned ridges set within a plain flat border visible on one edge, 2mm wide. The sheet narrows and has probably been trimmed, as where it folds under itself it is 12mm wide and here it has six raised ridges present and the lower one disappears off the edge with no border.

The blade is a elongated sub-triangle with concave sides and a convex blade edge. The corners of the blade are flared outwards and are abraded and therefore rounded. The blade as it tapers becomes rectangular in section. At the tip there is an integral rectangular sectioned collar with a fragment of the integral tang protruding from the upper edge. The break of the tang is not recent. There are no signs of decoratio.



The surface of the chisel has a incomplete well-developed mid green patina with some pitting and abrasion.

Tanged and collared chisels typically date from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (Llyn Fawr period). An example, dating to the Wilburton/Wallington phase, is known from Doncaster, Yorkshire (Burgess, Coombs and Davies, 1972, 217), though the main currency is during the Ewart Park phase (c.900-700 BC) probably continuing into the subsequent Llyn Fawr period (c.700-600 BC). A similar tanged chisel was found in association with a large amount of Late Bronze Age material as part of a probable Early Iron Age hoard at Gussage St. Michael, Dorset (Knight, Ormrod & Pearce 2015: 51, no. 250b). Another similar example, from Kingston, Dorset, is published by Pearce (1984: 476, no. 416a), from a site which has also produced Late Bronze Age pottery.

It comprises a strip of sheet gold with worn transverse breaks at either end. Now bent approximately mid-way along its length at an obtuse angle, probably after deposition; the bend shows stress marks and there is a small tear at the apex.

BH-1BE953 (2014 T901), also described as an unidentified object states: “There is a range of gold strip and ribbon ornaments datable to the British Bronze Age. The less numerous types include arm and possibly ear ornaments fastening by means of a hook at each end, or a hook and eye (piercing)… There are also an increasing number of (often) thin gold strips and fragments with terminal piercings which on grounds of composition could fit into a Bronze Age context. Again, there are continental analogues, beginning within the Early Bronze Age sheet gold tradition.”
