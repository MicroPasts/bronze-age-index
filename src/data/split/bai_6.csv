The navey who found the ancient weapon was well advised in taking it to Mr. Brazant, because in addition to being a keen antiquariest, he is also anxious to witness the opening of the long-promised museum in Stroud, and although he has been made a valuable offer for this find, he has formed the resolution not to part with it until he has received assurance that it will eventually come to the local Museum...,A find would probably be there (i.e. at Dudbridge), as at Ryeford, as Celtic (sic) people who lived in Gloucestershire would naturally when moving from one hilly district to another select the most suitable spots in marshy lowlands for passing on to firmer ground."" Here follows a dissertation on varieties of Celts from ""Arms and Armour"", and irrelevant remarks about Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, Romans, Gauls, etc.,The accompanying sketch is a copy of that accompanying the newspaper article.,Copy of covering letter from C. Gardiner of Stroud Museum, to the B.M., dated January 1, 1936: ""When I got here some 6 years ago, I found the enclosed cutting. I pursued the bronze and I believe it was bought by a man who behaves badly and exiled himself to Maderia [?]. It is probably locked up in his house here, but though I  have written to him through his lawyer he does not reply. Still, the figure is probably enough to enable you to describe it in the list of English bronzes should you care to do so.""",Joellen McGann,http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3825/13305400013_cf0d5a0794_z.jpg,http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3825/13305400013_cf0d5a0794_b.jpg,http://www.flickr.com/photos/MicroPasts/13305400013,superuser,drawB16
