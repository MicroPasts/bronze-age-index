961418,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A fragment of a copper-alloy socketed axehead of late Bronze Age date, c. 1000 - 800 BC. The fragment is the blade end of the axehead which is trapezoidal in shape with a worn cutting edge and rounded corners. The cross-section is rectangular and the breaks are old and worn. The interior is hollow.



The metal has a dark green delaminated patina and is worn. The fragment is 47.5mm long, 37.2mm wide, 15.4mm thick and weighs 57.3g.



Due to the incomplete nature of the axehead it is not possible to ascribe it to a particular type series and it has therefore been dated broadly as late Bronze Age in date circa 1000 - 800 BC.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,57.3,,,15.4,47.5,1,Rebecca Griffiths,Rebecca Griffiths,Yorkshire and the Humber,North Yorkshire,Ryedale,Kirkbymoorside,SE7185,From finder,54.25575779,-0.91167063,YORYM-DFEEAB,,GOC0003.jpg,Bronze Age : Socketed Axehead,York Museums Trust,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/bmorris/GOC0003.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1064250.jpg
961492,Scabbard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-800,"A cast copper-alloy Late Bronze Age 'bag-shaped' dagger scabbard chape associated with the Carp's Tongue complex. On close examination, the chape is formed from a single sheet of copper alloy, beaten and folded over to form the bulbus crescent shape. A section of the back has been lost in antiquity, the front, which remains intact, has three rivet fixing holes. There is the remnant of one hole, to the broken rear of the chape. The surface has a mid-green roughened patina.



Dimensions. 30.84mm wide, 20.39mm deep and the metal is 0.54mm thick, weighing 6.6gm.



Similar bag-shaped chapes on the database include: NARC-5DEF37, NMS-99FB70, HAMP-095061, WILT-D4F151, SUSS-C65251, and DOR-BD9AED. The latter example explains:



A similar, although undecorated, chape is recorded in WILT-D4F151 and another in a Bronze Age Hoard (SUSS-C65251) where Neil Wilkin notes The two bag-shaped chapes (Nos. 3-4) are of a type present in several hoards in South-east England. They are primarily distributed in South-east England and in Northern France, with a small number of outliers in Ireland (O'Connor 1980: 190; List 161; Gerloff 2004, fig. 17.9, 3). Parallels for the bag-shaped chapes can be found in the Mininis Bay hoard, Kent (Ibid., fig.59, no. 12), and a similar bag-shaped chape with two peg holes is part of the Salisbury hoard (British Museum: 1961,006.7; 1998,0901.149). Bag-shaped chapes are often associated with the Carp's Tongue (CT) complex/horizon (O'Connor 1980, 190-91), although Gerloff (2004, 146) notes that their distribution is somewhat peripheral to their principal distribution areas. It is possible that the blade tip (No. 5) belongs to either a Ewart Park or a Carp's Tongue sword, both are types that are closely associated with hoards and deposits that also include bag-shaped chapes (Ibid.).

961742,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 17.1 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (8.6 mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. Potential decoration is present on one side as four circular depressions around the mid point. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 34.3 mm (2.6 mm thick). The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. 



It measures 80.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.3 mm, width at the butt is 17.1 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.6 mm. It weighs 77.7 grams.



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

961746,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Descriptions 




Socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 24.5mm; surviving width 50.8mm; width at break 42.0mm; thickness at break 12mm; weight 54.8g.



This is the lower blade and cutting edge of a socketed axe, broken across the internal socket aperture in antiquity. The cutting edge is worn and damaged so the original edge no longer survives, but curved shape and the curved expanding nature of the sides suggest it may have originally possessed slightly flared tips. The incomplete nature of this axe means it cannot be definitely assigned a type.



The break has occurred at the point that the socket opening began, though only about 3mm of the socket wall survives above this. This is nonetheless sufficient to demonstrate that the axe was cast with a misaligned core, as indicated by the differential thickness of the socket walls on each face (5.4mm and 2.4mm); this may have influenced the breakage. There is a slightly bowing inwards on the face with the thinner socket wall, which may represent an impact blow.



The fragment is heavily pitted with green corrosion, though retains a patchy bronze patina particularly around the edges.




Socketed axe or palstave fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 21.8mm; surviving width 44.2mm; thickness 10.4-14mm; weight 59.6g.



This is a thick copper alloy fragment, roughly sub-rectangular in plan and elliptical in section, tapering in side profile to one edge. The object has broken across both the long edges in antiquity, but the shorter sides appear to be largely original. The overall form is suggestive of the lower blade of an axe, which is supported by the remains of a casting seam on one side, though the fragment lacks any diagnostic features that might allow it to be assigned to a specific type. In the thicker break there are possible faint remnants of a socket aperture, though this feature is not conclusive. Alternatively, the thick nature of the fragment could infer a palstave.



The fragment is covered by a combination of smooth silvery patina and green corrosion pitting. There are also patches of bronze patina particularly around the edges.




Jet - one runner



Dimensions: top surface length 26.0mm; top surface width 21.5mm; maximum height 36.5mm; weight 48.0g.



This is a roughly oval-shaped conical jet with a thick single runner extending from the pouring reservoir. The upper surface is rough and uneven, representing the dross created by metal as it cools while the runner is smooth. The upper surface is largely level, but the sides around the reservoir are slightly raised; this is a natural result of the cooling process. There is no distinction in the transition between the reservoir and the runner, suggesting the metal was poured into a mould with a wide conical opening. The runner tapers to a thick point with slightly concave sides from the reservoir.



The jet is pitted with green corrosion, though largely retains a bronze patina.




Incomplete jet



Dimensions: top surface length 22.8mm; top surface width 19.9mm; maximum height 16.8mm; weight 21.5g.



This is the pouring reservoir of a broadly oval jet, with a rough, uneven upper surface, representing metal dross, and a dip in the metal towards the centre. The reservoir narrows with slightly



convex sides towards the runner, creating an overall 'bowl' shape, indicating the shape of the mould opening. However, the jet has broken at the transition from the reservoir to the runner(s). It is thus unclear whether this would form one or two runners.



The jet is covered in a rough grey patina, intermitted with patches of bright green corrosion or bronze disease.




Probable rapier fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 49.6mm; hilt width 24.1mm; hilt thickness 5.2mm; butt width 15.8; butt thickness 4.4mm; width at break 14.3mm; thickness at break 4.2mm; weight 27.0g.



This is a small copper alloy fragment of a probable hilt from a blade, broken across the upper blade. The fragment is quite worn, making diagnostic features difficult to ascertain. However, the fragment shows signs of rounded asymmetrical hilt shoulders that taper down to a narrow blade with a biconvex section, which is characteristic of a rapier. Additionally, above the shoulders the fragment tapers inwards to two possible notches before projecting to a rounded butt. It is thus likely this piece once belonged to a rapier.



The object has broken across the upper blade in antiquity and the break is now worn. There are no associated marks or casting flaws.



The fragment is worn and pitted with green corrosion, though retains a patchy bronze patina particularly around the edges.","This hoard of objects can certainly be dated to the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1300-800 BC) and probably to the Late Bronze Age (1100-800BC), however in its fragmentary state, the artefacts lack closely diagnostic elements to allow conclusive dating to a particular period within this broader frame. Many fragmentary hoards were deposited during the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 BC) of the Late Bronze Age and it is likely, on a balance of probability, the hoard dates to this period.



Broken socketed axes (such as No.1 above) are a feature of Late Bronze Age hoards, typically dating to the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 cal. BC) (Needham et al. 1997). It is common for axes to be broken across the point of the internal socket aperture and examples of similar breakage patterns can be seen on four examples in the St. Nicholas hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt n.d.). The slight bowing on one face may indicate this piece was deliberately broken before deposition.



The second axe fragment (No.2 above) is harder to interpret because while it is likely to have belonged to a socketed axe, the thick nature of the fragment, and lack of any additional features, means one cannot rule out the possibility that it once belonged to a palstave. This might be further supported by the narrow nature of the blade, which is a feature of both Transitional and Late palstaves (Smith 1959). Transitional palstave have been dated to the Penard-Wilburton phases (c.1300-1000 BC), while Late palstaves held currency in the Wilburton to Ewart Park phases (c.1100-800 BC) (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 145-163; Needham et al. 1997). Given the other associations in this hoard, it is most likely that this fragment once belonged either to a socketed axe or to a Late palstave, both types circulating during the Late Bronze Age. Complete examples of Late palstaves were found in Late Bronze Age hoards from Colwinston and Tal y garn 1, while two palstave butt fragments were present in the Penllyn hoard, all Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt and Lodwick 2003; Gwilt et al. 2012a; Gwilt et al. 2015). In total, about 60 examples of Late palstaves are known from Wales in hoards and as single finds.



The jets (Nos 3, 4) represent the excess reservoirs of metal at the top of moulds and are a by-product of the casting process. Jets are commonly incorporated into hoards during the Late Bronze Age, yet are rarely present within hoards of Early and Middle Bronze Age date. The generic nature of these two jets means the objects they produced cannot be determined. An early association of a single runner jet within a hoard may be found within the Guilsfield hoard (Savory 1965, Fig. 7.24; 1980, 117-8, Cat. 268 & Fig. 38), dating to the Blackmoor phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1020-920BC (Needham et al 1997, 82). However, casting jets are more typically represented in hoard associations dating to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (c.920-800 BC). They are now known from numerous Ewart Park phase hoards in Wales including the St Ishmael (Carmarthenshire), Manorbier (Pembrokeshire), Cowbridge (Vale of Glamorgan) and Glascoed (Monmouthshire) hoards (Gwilt and Lodwick 2002; Lodwick and Gwilt 2002; Gwilt et al. 2011; 2012b).



The final object in the hoard, the possible rapier (No.5), is an interesting element. Rapiers hold their main currency in the Middle Bronze Age (c.1500-1100 BC), with the last phase of their production ending in the Penard phase (1300-1150 BC), when they were superseded by developments in sword-making (Burgess and Gerloff 1981, 113). Although worn, enough survives of this fragment to suggest it belonged to a Group IV rapier, as indicated by the side notches, slender shoulders and small butt (ibid., 62). Group IV rapiers belong to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age but continued in use into the Wilburton phase at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, spanning the centuries from 1300 to 1000 BC (ibid., 106-109). These are the most common of the British rapier forms and they were also commonly reworked later during their use lives, often being found as broken and undiagnostic fragments, suggesting that some remained in use and circulation over a long time period. It is entirely feasible therefore, that a rapier made towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age could remain in use and circulation into the Late Bronze Age, only being deposited in a hoard then. In Wales, a possible Group IV rapier fragment was deposited with fragments of two Late palstaves, a spearhead and a flat plate at Penllyn, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt et al. 2015).



The consistent patina and corrosion of the components in this hoard suggest they all entered the ground at around the same time. These were then likely dispersed by historical and modern agricultural processes. The majority of the objects (Nos 1-4) are consistent with a Late Bronze Age date, probably the Ewart Park phase (c.920-800 BC), when the burial of fragmentary hoards was a common practice. Examples from Wales include hoards from Tal-y-garn 1 and 2, Colwinston (all Vale of Glamorgan), and Glascoed (Monmouthsire) (Lodwick and Gwilt 2002; Gwilt and Lodwick 2003a; 2003b; Gwilt et al. 2012a). The rapier fragment predates the other objects in the hoard, in its manufacture, by up to 300 years, but it is likely it represents an old object that remained in circulation use and re-use, or perhaps as a piece of scrap metal, until the Late Bronze Age. Alternatively, it may represent the rediscovery of an older deposit that was then reburied. The proximity of the rapier to the other finds within a three metre square area, coupled with the lack of contemporary deposits in the surrounding area and the consistent condition of the artefacts means that on the balance of probability the rapier can be considered associated with the other material. In terms of size and composition, the Mawr hoard is most closely comparable with the Penllyn hoard, Vale of Glamorgan (Gwilt et al. 2015).



The find-spot is located on a north-facing promontory about 163m above sea level and overlooking the River Cathan to the north-east, which feeds westwards into the larger River Loughor. A preliminary search of the Historic Environment Record revealed no other Bronze Age or prehistoric features recorded from the immediate area

961873,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"1. Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B 



Dimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.



This is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.



2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragment



Dimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.



This is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.



Fragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.



3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)



Dimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.



This is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.



There are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.



4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)



Dimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.



This is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.



There are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.



5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D 



Dimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.



This is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.



The sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.



The molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).



The axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.



6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)



Dimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.



These are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. 



The socket end (visible on fragments 6 & 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.



Fragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,



with a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.



All fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.



9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)



Dimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.



This is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.



There is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.



10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11



Dimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.



This is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.



The spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.



The fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.



11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable sword



Dimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.



This is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.



The breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.



The fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.



12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner form



Dimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.



This is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.



The jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.



13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner form



Dimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. 



This a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.



The jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.



14. Copper alloy annular ring



Dimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.



This is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.



The ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.



15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning cap



Dimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.



This is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.



The object is covered in a dark green patina.



This object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. 



16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slag



Dimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.



This is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.



This piece is covered in green corrosion.



This slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards.","Bibliography

Description: The axehead has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle, with two concave faces flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade is wide and flaring creating a crescentic cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It is proceed by a double raised collar. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have not been worked down and remain fairly prominent, particularly towards the collar end. The blade edge has some wear but remains in good conditions. The side loop remains on one side. The axehead has a dark greenish well formed patina with some slightly lighter mottling in places, but is fairly restricted although may be areas where corrosion has begun to effect the axehead.

It has a lenticular longitudinal cross-section and rectangular horizontal cross-section. The tang end is flat and measures 13.5x1.7mm. It expands to 18.7mm wide (and 8.5mm thick) at the stop-ridge, beyond which the edges of the blade below flare to a cutting edge 29.9mm wide (and 2.3mm thick). The cutting edge is slightly curved and the very edge is chamfered to both faces. Otherwise the edges of the object are sharp and c.90 degrees.

The patina is bluey-green in colour and smooth to touch. The chisel measures 96.4mm in length, 29.9mm in max.width, 8.5mm in max.thickness and weighs 84.55g.","Dr Dot Boughton comments, 'Developed flat axes .... are very early - Migdale and Aylesford metalworking tradition, that is Early Bronze Age period, probably dating from c.

962528,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-800,"An incomplete copper-alloy socketed spearhead probably dating from the late Bronze Age, about 1100 – 800 BC. Only the tip of the spear remains which is triangular in plan and lozenge in section. The base of the socket can be seen at the broken end of the spear.



The metal has a dark green/brown patina and is worn. The spear is 57.9mm long, 22.7mm wide, 9.7mm thick and weighs 24g.



As this object represents only a small fragment of the spearhead it is not possible to classify the form of the complete object with complete confidence. However, the object's apparent lack of a pronounced midrib might be indicative of the 'hollow blade' type, Davis Group 12, and it is this classification which is tentatively suggested.

962778,Torc,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Solid gold armring with punched decoration. The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap. There is noticeable wear to the outer edge of the object as the surface is smoother and the punched dots are much shallower.



Length: 82.09mm



Width: 68.57mm



Diameter: 11.55mm



Weight: 311g





Discussion:



The armring is similar in form to those of the Tullydonnell hoard from County Donegal, which were dated to c. 1200 - 800 BC. A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.

963082,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2050,-1700,"A complete copper alloy miniature flat axe or possibly a chisel, 67.2 mm in length and dating to the early to late early Bronze Age (2050 BC- 1700BC).



The axe has straight sides, expanding into a cutting edge, which is curved and 36.6 mm across, with a cutting edge around 3 mm thick. The butt end narrows to 26.9 mm in width and is slightly convex. There are flanges on both sides of the shaft. The profile of the axe is lenticular or an elongated pointed oval with a maximum thickness at the centre of 13.2 mm. Weight 130.45 gsm



The surface is heavily pitted with the brownish-green patina of copper-alloy.



Notes:



This object's form is similar to full-sized, solid flat axes, resembling a smaller version of the earliest and simplest solid cast copper alloy axe-heads with tapering sides and rounded butts. It is uncertain whether it is a miniature axe or a chisel intended for fine working or was intended as a votive object; it is larger than other miniature axes (eg.HAMP-B3BE22, HAMP-657353) which have been proposed to have a votive function (Robinson, P; 1995).



Miniature flat axes such as this tend to fit in the chronology at the very end of the early Bronze Age when developed axes are starting out. It is likely that this example is dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II-III), of metalworking tradition phase IV-V, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 3 circa 2050 - 1700 CAL. BC. Axes of this size and form are difficult to parallel, Schmidt & Burgess (1981) catalogue a number of small developed flat axes as Variant Swinton (p 67-8, nos. 375-380) but all examples are between 87mm and 92mm in length. Although this example is smaller it may have been used for a similar function.

964016,Finger Ring,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1500,180,"An incomplete copper alloy spiral finger-ring. It is circular and formed by two coils of an oval cross-sectioned metal wire; both ends taper and flatten slightly. The patina is corroded in patches of dark and pale green. The outside surface is very abraded and heavily pitted, while the inside of the ring is smoother.



It is difficult or impossible to tell Bronze Age from Iron Age from Roman spiral finger-rings. It is possible that earlier examples of prehistoric finger-rings may have more turns around the finger and be thicker than later examples. It is therefore a possibility that this finger-ring can be dated to the Bronze Age period.

Description: The fragment is irregularly shaped heavily worn and patinated. It represents part of the body and socket of the object and is crescentic in cross-section. The rim is raised and triangular in cross-section, it has incised herringbone decoration. The breaks are relatively worn likely indicating archaic damage. It has an even bright green patination.



Measurements: 33.95mm long, 27.3mm wide, 12.13mm thick and 23.57g in weight.



Discussion: This fragment is very limited in size and makes exact identification difficult. From the form of the fragment it seems likely that the object is a socket gauge of some description although this would make a very large example. In regards size it seems more in line with socketed axes but the only group with similar, albeit cast decoration are Axes with Rope Moulded Mouth type which are known from Scotland (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos. 1033-1037) with one known from Northern England LANCUM-D99FD1 so this link is tenuous.",,4,Copper alloy,,Returned to finder,Metal detector,,,,,23.57,,,12.13,33.95,1,Jo Ahmet,Jo Ahmet,South East,Kent,Swale,Sheldwich,TR0055,Generated from computer mapping software,51.25907021,0.86501887,KENT-EAC37E,,KENTEAC37E.jpg,Ba fragment,Kent County Council,Attribution License,https://finds.org.uk/images/ucljo/KENTEAC37E.jpg,https://finds.org.uk/images/thumbnails/1066683.jpg

The axe is sub rectangular in plan and has a flared crescent shaped cutting blade edge. The sides are triangular in shape. The socket is sub-square in section.



The axe is 101.2mm in length. The blade is 44.4mm wide. The internal wall of the axe is approx 6.4mm thick. The external width of the socket is 40.7mm, whilst the internal width is 30.6mm. The width of the axe inclusing the loop is 40.6mm. The weight is 307.0g



The socket features a moulded bevelled collar which is immediately above a similar moulded band of lower relief. It is from this band that the top of the loop emerges. The loop has an external diameter of 22.7mm and in internal diameter of 10.6mm. It extends approx. 11.7mm from the side of the axe.



Both triangular shaped sides of the axe have the remains of a prominent casting seam still visible. The sub-rectangular faces of the axe are plan and undecorated. The axe widens towards the curving blade edge.



The axe is a dark green colour and the surface patina is relatively intact; being smooth with some abrasion, particular on the blade edge.



The diagnostic feature of this axe are prominent collar above a rib and plain decoration on the axe's body.

965080,Ingot,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1000,-700,"Incomplete cast copper alloy ingot which would have originally been circular in plan and plano-convex in profile, but this ingot is sub-rectangular in plan, triangular in profile, and square in section, as it comes from one edge of the original ingot. Plano-convex ingots like this one were used during the Late Bronze Age, c.1000-700 BC. The surface of the ingot is pitted where air bubbles formed during the casting process and the sides of the fragment have cavities typically seen in these bun ingots. There is a large rectangular rim and recess at the outer edge which could potentially represent a socket from a socketed tool that has been melted into the ingot. There are dark green and coppery brown areas and light green patches of bronze disease. Similar ingot fragments have been found in metalworkers hoards in Cornwall dating from the Late Bronze Age, most recently in a hoard (2016 T20) from St Levan (CORN-E8DF11) and in another hoard (2012 T570) from St Buryan (CORN-37D710), which were found with socketed axes that date from the Ewart Park phase (c.950-850 BC) of the Late Bronze Age.

965252,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-1450,80,"An incomplete fragment most probably part of a copper alloy ""Moustache-shaped"" object probably of Middle Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age date (1500-300 BC). The artefact is heavily rolled resulting in abrasion to all surfaces. What remains is globular in form (teardrop shaped) with an oval cross section. It is probably one of a pair of pointed drop-shaped elements conjoined by an integrally cast bar. The remains of a heavily eroded rectangular bar is present on one side of the droplet. The external edges are all decorated with multiple longitudinal grooves The metal is a mid-green in colour with a smooth patina.



Notes:

These moustache-like objects are thought to date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age, after the discovery of one in the Salisbury Hoard (Stead, 1998, no.117). An example was found recently in a Middle Bronze Age context at Clay Farm, Cambridgeshire (Current Archaeology March 2012, Issue 264, 35). Some are 'single' examples while others are 'double' like this example, the drop-shaped elements often extending downwards rather more than outwards, for example YORYM-1AA0C5, SF-520513, HAMP-6F4C45, BERK-C3E5A3 and BH-AA1CBE. Descriptions of other moustache-like objects with similar perforations describe iron corrosion or wood mineralisation around the perforation. Although very similar to wing-shaped chapes, it seems unlikely they had a similar function, as the perforation (and size of the object) is comparably small.

965441,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Ribbed socketed axe fragment, probable South Wales type



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 48.6mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 40.9mm; thickness of mouth 5.3-7.2mm; width of upper loop 4.0mm; dimensions runner-stubs (1) near loop 8.3 by 2.9mm; height 0.1mm; (2) face 6.6 by 2.9mm; height 0.1mm; surviving weight 39.4g. 



This is an upper face and partial mouth fragment of a ribbed bronze socketed axe. The axe has a collar, which in profile is vertical rather than everted, with a slightly convex shape and slight rounding at the upper and lower edge margins. A narrow upper loop-stub is present, which is high-set and descends from the collar. The mouth is wide and flat, with two runner-stubs evident beside the loop-stub and at the centre of the axe face. The external and internal plan shape of the mouth was once sub-rectangular with rounded corners. Two poorly defined decorative ribs may be seen on this small fragment, descending from the collar down the upper face of the axe and near parallel with each other. The axe fragment has been bent and distorted in antiquity, probably through hammering and bending to break the axe up. The mouth corner has been bent slightly inwards, making the internal angle around 70 degrees, rather than the expected 90 degrees. On the non-loop side of the mouth, there is bending near the break, giving the mouth and collar a concave outer surface. Near the break across the face, there is also distortion of the wall profile, giving the external face a concave profile and this was probably created through hammer impact. On the loop-side of the face there is a flattened impact facet, which has partly obscured one of the decorative ribs, although it is not certain as to whether this was damage caused in antiquity or during the recent retrieval of the axe from the ground. The axe fragment has a dark grey-green patina, with mouth top and break-edges showing areas of light-green and powdery surfaces. On the non-loop side, the collar break-edge shows a small area of unstable cracking within an area of light green and powdery corrosion deposit. 




Ribbed socketed axe fragment, probable South Wales type



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 76.0mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 34.2mm; thickness of mouth 5.6-6.7mm; dimensions runner stub - face 8.5 by 5.0mm; height 0.1mm; surviving weight 43.1g. 



This is an upper face, partial mouth and side fragment on the non-loop side of a ribbed bronze socketed axe. The axe has a narrow, well-defined collar, which in profile is straight and vertical rather than everted. The mouth was once near flat-topped, but has become distorted and slightly angled by later damage. The traces of two runner stubs may be detected, a complete one near the centre of a face side and a very small remnant stub trace on the non-loop side, just evident as a remaining slight protuberance on the mouth surface near the break. The external and internal plan of the mouth of the axe was once sub-rectangular with rounded corners. Two well defined decorative ribs may be seen on this small axe fragment descending from the collar down the upper face of the axe. The diagonal break across the face has removed all but the upper short section of the central rib, however the surviving side rib is straight, suggesting these two ribs were straight and parallel. The axe fragment has been bent and distorted in antiquity, probably through hammering while heated, to break the axe up. In plan, the mouth corner angle is around 120 degrees, rather than the expected 90 degrees and there is also a hammer impact mark on the collar, causing the mouth top to invert and distort. Along the diagonal face break, there is outward bending of the axe wall along the break margin and it is likely that the axe side has been distorted, as evidenced by a concave and splaying side-profile. On the interior wall surface, on the lower face, there is a localised tear in the metal, extending 5mm up the face. The break surfaces are markedly irregular, their patination indicating the axe was broken in antiquity. The axe surfaces have a dark grey-green patination. There are small localised areas of light-green and powdery corrosion products along breaks. At the tapering lower face and side tip of the fragment, there is an area of visible and unstable cracking within an area of light green and powdery corrosion deposit.




Plain socketed axe fragment



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 49.1mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 28.5mm; maximum surviving width at lower loop insertion 37.2mm; thickness of mouth 5.1-7.1mm; width of lower loop 5.0mm; surviving weight 39.2g. 



This is an upper face, side and partial mouth fragment of a plain bronze socketed axe. The axe has a narrow everted mouth moulding, defined on its lower margin by a wide concave shaped and inset moulding. A lower loop-stub is present on the axe side, indicating a narrow loop, the break having removed the upper stub. The mouth was once near flat-topped, but has become distorted through later damage. There are no runner-stubs or scars evident on this partial mouth fragment. The external and internal plan of the mouth of the axe was once sub-rectangular with rounded corners. The face of the axe is plain. Part of the casting seam down the upper loop side survives, indicating the seam was hammered or filed down as the axe was prepared for use. The axe fragment has been bent and distorted in antiquity, probably through hammering and bending to break the axe up. In plan, the mouth corner is around 120 degrees rather than the 90 degrees expected, while near the break on the non-loop mouth, the mouth top has been distorted inwards, possibly through a hammer blow. On the lower face side, there is pronounced denting of the axe surface, giving a marked concavity in the face surface. A localised point of impact with a blunt ended tool with a round head may be observed, while the even patination indicates this occurred in antiquity. The break surfaces are markedly irregular in places. The axe fragment has a dark grey-green patination. Around the mouth top and along break-edges there are areas of light-green and powdery corrosion deposits.

Dimensions: Maximum width 38.2mm; maximum surviving length 31.5mm; maximum surviving length of inner faceted 17.3mm; surface maximum thickness 20.5mm; surviving weight 70.1g. 



This is a wedge-shaped and tapering bronze artefact fragment, with one flat side, one convex faceted side and two break surfaces, one upper and one lower. The upper part of this object is both widest and thickest, the object tapering and thinning towards it foot. The front face is shaped flat, while the reverse has a narrow flattened top with a side facet on each side, giving a raised angular convex profile. The break along the upper surface has a diagonal downward angle, making the inner faceted face markedly narrower than the front and flat face. The surfaces are all heavily worn and corroded with a light-green and powdery patina, to the extent that the facets on the reverse surface are now poorly defined. The lower break is irregular while the upper break is particularly uneven and corroded, indicating the breaks occurred in antiquity. In one small area along the lower break, there is an area of exposed bronze metal, which has been recently scraped or filed.","References

965601,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1150,"An incomplete copper alloy, tip from a spearhead, probably of Middle Bronze Age period, dating from c. BC 1500 to c. BC 1150.



The object is broadly triangular in plan and broadly lozenge shaped in cross section. The object has a rounded point at the top, which seems to have sustained some damage. From the point the sides of the object taper out, ensuring the object is wider at the base. There is a central raised ridge running vertically down the middle of the spear head, this appears on both sides. There is an old horizontal break at the base of the object, probably indicating the spear was broken in antiquity. There is damage to both edges of the blade.



It measures 37.2 mm in length, 12.5 mm wide (base), 7.2 mm wide (tip) and 6.6 mm thick. It weighs 7.7 g.



The spear head is a mid green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. This object has lost most of it's diagnostic features and as a result further classification is difficult. However similar spearhead fragments have been recorded on the database, including SWYOR-1F74C1, SF-C557DC and WMID-270D2F.

965669,Hoard,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,,,"Descriptions 




Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham faceted axe (Class D) - socket mouth and loop fragment



Dimensions: Maximum surviving length 44.6mm; maximum surviving width at mouth 34.5mm; depth of collar to upper moulding margin 17.6mm; width of loop 5.3-5.5mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 20.9g. 



This is a partial mouth, upper face and loop-side fragment of a bronze slender socketed axe. The axe has a deep and trumpet shaped collar, whose lower margins are defined by three horizontal grooves, with a combined maximum width of approximately 4mm. The mouth top is flat, but the original shape of the mouth in plan is now unknown, due to distortion and bending of the fragment. The loop is slender and its upper arm descends from within the lower collar zone. The upper surviving face-edge on the loop-side has been emphasised by a vertical rib descending from the grooved collar lower margin. A facet is also visible on the upper face, running in near parallel with the ribbed face-edge, the facet edge also descending from the grooved collar margin. The axe fragment has been severely bent out of shape in the upper collar area, possibly in antiquity and prior to the burial of the artefact. The artefact has a brown patina and the break-edges look to be ancient. The axe fragment has suffered a modern glancing scrape along the upstanding and ribbed face-edge and on the collar, revealing areas of green patina and surface shine, where the original surfaces have been damaged. It is likely that this surface damage occurred during the recent discovery and retrieval of the socketed axe by the finder, or by through impact with agricultural machinery, when the axe was disturbed and dispersed from its original burial context.




Small ribbed socketed axe (undiagnostic to type) - blade fragment



Dimensions: maximum surviving length 27.4mm; width at upper break 36.6mm; blade width 42.8mm; max. surviving depth of socket approx. 11mm; surviving weight (prior to conservation) 40.6g. 



This is a blade-end fragment of a small bronze socketed axe, with just the base of the socket present and surviving. Near the blade, the sides flare out with concave curves to provide a modestly expanded blade edge. The ends of ribbed decoration is evident on both faces, four ribs present on one face, and one, possibly two ribs surviving on the opposite face. The ribs extend far down the face of the axe, their ends being between 12-18mm from the blade edge. Prominent casting seams are evident down each side, however appear to have been rapidly hammered down. Striations parallel with the blade edge suggest it was prepared for use after casting. The socket mould part was misaligned during casting, resulting in an extremely thin face wall on one side (0.7mm thick) and a thickened wall on the other (3.8-4.3mm thick). The axe fragment has a brown surface patina. There are localised patches near the blade edge where original surfaces have not survived and these have a green patina.



Identification & Discussion 



One of the artefact fragments (Cat. 1, above) may be identified as a Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham or Class D slender faceted axe. The deep and trumpet shaped collar, slender form and facet on the surviving upper face are all diagnostic of Class D / Type Meldreth axes, while the lower horizontal grooved moulding typifies the Type Aylsham Variant (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 204-7; Needham 1990, 41-3; Gwilt et al 2005, 37-8). Type Meldreth axes are generally regarded as of British type, although they do occur in Ireland and France (O' Connor 1980, 166-7; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 53-62, Cats. 296-392). Nearly all of the known hoard associations containing these axes are securely of Late Bronze Age date and belonging to the Ewart Park phase between 1000-800 BC (e.g. Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61), although a few examples have been found in slightly earlier Late Bronze Age hoards dating to 1150-1000 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981, 210-1; Needham 1990, 43; Eogan 2000, 61). In Wales, approaching 40 examples of slender faceted axes of Meldreth or Class D type are now known, being most common across south-east Wales (e.g. Savory 1980, 120-2, Cats. 278 & 282; Gwilt 2004; Northover unpublished, 257-8, 267-9 & Cats. 583-610). Examples of these axes have been found in recently reported hoards from Rossett Community (Wrexham), Llanfrynach Community (Powys), Grosmont Community (Monmouthshire) and Llanharan Community (Rhondda Cynon Taf), all belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (Gwilt et al 2005; 2016; 2018; Knight et al 2017).



The second socketed axe blade fragment (Cat. 2, above) belonged to a small ribbed socketed axe, however this blade end fragment is not diagnostic to precise type. Various forms of ribbed axes are common components of hoards from south-east Wales and belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC). For example, ribbed axes of South Wales Type and their Variant forms are a frequent and dominating element within Ewart Park hoards of Late Bronze Age date across south-east Wales (e.g. McNeil 1973, Fig. 9; Moore 1978; Savory 1980, 49, 120-2; Needham 1981; Gwilt 2004). Here, over 40 hoards now contain at least 150 examples, making it the core area within Britain for their burial within hoards. In addition, ribbed socketed axes, variously known as Southern English/Welby Type ribbed axes, Yorkshire Type axes, Croxton Type axes, Breiddin Type axes and Llanarth Type axes have been found beside South Wales type axes in around a dozen known hoards of Ewart Park date from south-east Wales (e.g. Storrie 1887; Metcalf & Lambert 1979; Savory 1980, 120-1, Cats. 273, 280, 281; Gwilt 2004, 132-4, Appendix 1.1, 1.3, 1.10; Gwilt & Lodwick 2005; 2006; 2013; Lodwick & Gwilt 2007; Gwilt 2008; Northover unpublished, Hoards 74, 79, 85, 124). Therefore, this presence is entirely consistent with a Late Bronze Age hoard association from this region.



The two reported artefacts were discovered approximately 80m apart and within the same field. Given their contemporary Late Bronze Age date, probably within the Ewart Park phase and dating to 1000-800 BC, it is probable that these two artefacts were once part of a directly associated hoard group and buried in the ground at the same time. It is probable that the ancient hoard group was disturbed and dispersed during recent agricultural activity, such as ploughing, harrowing or during earth movement events in the field.



A preliminary search of the Heritage Environment Record (HER) for the area (via www.archwilio.org.uk) revealed no Bronze Age features or sites in the adjacent fields. Some prehistoric activity is known to the east on Mynydd Llangors and Cefn Moel, in the form of hut settlements, a putative burnt mound and burial chamber and occasional flint tool finds. It is potentially significant that the landscape location selected for the deposition of this small hoard was in the vicinity of Cwm Nantyfelin stream. This watercourse has its origins in multiple springs draining off the slopes of Cefn Moel, located 1-2km to the east-north-east. It flows westwards and converges with Afon Llynfi, 0.5-1km to the west, before draining into Llangors Lake to the north. This specific watery landscape locality is likely to have been deliberately selected for the deposition of the hoard as a gift to the gods (Gwilt 2004, 121; Gwilt et al 2013, 11). This pattern is repeated with the siting of a number of Late Bronze Age hoards across south-east Wales, adding strength to this observation.","References

965677,Flanged Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1800,-1500,"A copper alloy long flanged axehead /developed flat axe.



This axehead has a rounded arched butt and slightly diverging sides that abruptly expand to a broad crescentic blade and cutting edge, with the blade tips at right angles to the sides, but not recurving. Cast flanges extend along the sides, rising very gradually from the butt towards the middle of the axe and sloping down again to the blade expansion. This gives the axe a very shallow lenticular side profile. The flanges are slightly triple-faceted, so are slightly angled inwards on both face.



The axe has a very low ridge about two thirds of the way along the septum (c.45 mm from the butt), which may indicate the beginnings of stop ridge technology as is seen on later flanged axes and palstaves. A second curved ridge has been hammered into both faces at the blade expansion, . The blade is18.66 mm deep and has an even crescentic cutting edge,.

The surface is slightly pitted in some areas, but otherwise quite smooth and an even dark green-brown



Date: Early Bronze Age to Middle Bronze Age - c. 1800 - 1500 BC



Peter Reavill suggests that the axe dates to an Aylesford or Arreton metal working phase with a date in the final early Bronze age (EBA III) or the first part of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I).

The palstave is in good condition, with the copper alloy surface faded to a dark brown-ish orange with small patches of green patinisation and even smaller patches where the original shiny golden colour of the copper alloy persists. This survival, even to a small extent, is probably due to its deposition in a semi-waterlogged context. The butt is broad and the septum is relatively thick at 9.7mm. On either side of the septem the outer edges gradually rise upwards, creating a symmetrical curve on each side when viewed from above. The single loop, which is flattened in cross section. extends for 21mm on the upper surface, and there is a suggestion of a decorative cast line directly above this, extending along the side of the septum on this surface only. These broad edges narrow to the stop, which is rectilinear and measures 36.4 x 24.9mm. The blade extends in a linear fashion, only very gradually widening to the flared cutting edge. There is a central midrib on both sides of the blade, and it is further decorated with three deliberately incised grooves on the lower surface. The flared cutting edge remains relatively sharp, and measures 45.3mm in width and is 1.7mm thick at the cutting edge.



Matt Knight has commented on a similar example: ""Palstaves of this type are typically found across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, as well as further eastwards in Dorset and Wiltshire. Pearce (1983: 450 no. 279b, see also Plate 34) presents a very similar example from North Bovey. DEV-01DDC5 is a not dissimilar example from further east in the county.

The side view shows a wedge-shaped profile with a casting seam. There is a blunt projecting spur on one side 55 mm from the blade; this could be an abraded stump of a loop or casting flash.



The obverse shows the beginning of three ribs, without pellets, at 47 mm from the blade. The body terminates in jagged breaks 62 mm to 69 mm from the blade.



The axehead bears some resemblance to transitional and early Iron Age axes illustrated in Fig 4, Object Datasheet 2 of the LPFG, but due to the break, the collar, loop and final form of the socket cannot be identified.



Overall length is 69 mm, width at cutting edge 36 mm, 28 mm at break.

The first two finds were c.30cm below the surface and the soil around them dark in colour. Archaeological advice has been sought.



1) The copper alloy arm-ring has lost all of its original surface patina. It currently measures max.79.5mm in diameter (internal 54.6mm) and weighs 99.08g. It has an apparently circular cross-section.



2) The copper alloy socketed hammer is missing most of its socket but retains the blade. The socket has a circular cross-section (26.5mm diameter), the walls of which are 4.5mm wide, and the solid blade below has a rectangular cross-section, 23.5x23.3mm below the socket and thinning to 23.5x14.7mm at the hammering end. It is missing all of its original patina. The incomplete object measures 83.4mm in length and weighs 162g (to the nearest 2g). The finder reports this object was lying flat to one face when found.



3) The piece of metalworking debris is apparently copper alloy but is rather light (13.89g) with several popped air bubbles visible on the surface. The surface is otherwise quite lumpy. It measures 25.9x19.2x(max.)16.1mm.



Discussion

Given the close proximity of the first two finds, it is highly likely these are part of an undisturbed hoard and date to the 'Ornament Horizon' of the Taunton metalworking phase of the Middle Bronze Age (c.1400-1250 BC). A larger hoard from Hampshire (2017 T160 / SUR-590F5D) features three Liss type arm-rings (with herringbone decoration) alongside several other ornaments, a palstave axehead and a socketed hammer.

966940,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Incomplete cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, ovate in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve and has a broken edge on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.



See CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 & 283.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC).

The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.0 mm (thickness: 2.4 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). 



The axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.



It measures 72.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.4 mm, width at the butt is 12.0 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 48.6 grams.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC.

Each edge has damage and corrosion along their lengths. The butt end is corroded and rounded in shape with peripheral damage, it is also thinner in thickness, suggesting that this may have been done deliberately to accommodate the hilt. The blade is very slightly concave in cross section. Part of the original surface survives on one face, and it is possible to make out a regular pattern of stamped dot decoration. This would appear to have originally covered the whole side in a series of triangles, made up of lines of dot decoration coming in from one edge, the areas in between are undecorated and because of that form a series of blank triangular shapes coming in from the opposite edge to complement the decorated ones. The other side in much more heavily pitting with little of the original surface remaining, but it is still possible to discern some stamped dot decoration.

969784,Socketed Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-650,"An incomplete cast copper alloy socketed axe head dating from the Late Bronze age.



The axe head's socket, and an undeterminable amount of its face have been lost to an old break. The break is such that one side of the face is up to 18.1mm longer than the other. The lower half of the object and the blade survive more intact, however it is clear that the axe once had a thick brown patina which has only remained on a minority of the object. As this has worn away we are unable to see the axe's original surface, and as such, some diagnostic elements are difficult to make a decisive judgement about. The patina which has survived has probably done so due to being sat in water, with the patinaed parts sat in soil in the bed of the body of water.



The axe's body is sub-triangular in profile and sub-rectangular in plan, its sides expanding only very slightly, being almost straight, down the length of the axe from its socket towards the blade. Longitudinal linear casting seams are visible on both of the narrow sides of the axe head running from the socket of the axe down towards the blade, however it is difficult to see how far down these lines run due to the level of preservation. There is no surviving evidence for an attachment loop on the object. No decoration survives on the object, and it is likely that the axe's face has always been plain.



The hollow socket in the axe which remains is rectangular in plan which implies that the original socket was also this shape.



The blade edge is curved in profile and does not flare out at the blade corners. There is no evidence of sharpening on the blade, however, as the surviving surface is not the originals surface, this does not tell us whether this is the case. There are also no clear chips from use.



The surface is oxidized to a variety of colours ranging from dark brown to green in colour. The hollow interior of the object is devoid of any matter.



The axehead is 78.2mm long along its longest edge, 40.9mm wide at the blade, which then thins to c.35.9mm closer to the socket. The socket measures to 28.8mm long and 20.8mm wide. The metal is 4.9mm where the patina remains, and 2.5mm where it has been lost. The blade edge is c.4.7mm thick. The axe head weighs 107.64



grams.



The narrow straight sides of the blade suggest that it is part of an Armorican socketed axe, which are also referred to as 'Breton axes', a type which are usually non-functional and may have been 'ingot-axes' at least in north west France. Outside north west France they are widespread but uncommon. They date from the Late Bronze Age, the Llyn Fawr phase (c.800-700 BC), and into the Early Iron Age, the Hallstatt C phase (c.800-650 BC).

971661,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-2000,"Incomplete cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, sub-triangular in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade expand slightly and meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 27 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 76 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.



See CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.



Pearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.



Cowie & O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin & Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 & 283.



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

The break between the two pieces is probably recent and reveals a slightly purple crystalline matrix with many air bubbles. The edges of the breaks are not abraded but crisp. The butt is a slender trapezoidal with two rivet holes across the lower edge. There is a copper alloy rivet within each rivet hole. From these rivet holes the sides of the rapier expand into the shoulders of the blade. The maximum width of these shoulders is 31.03mm. From the shoulders the edge of the rapier narrows into the blade. From this point the blade itself tapers in width more gradually to almost have straight edges towards a broken edge. This break also feels fresh with crisp edges.  The blade is an elongated lozenge in cross-section with no clearly defined mid-rib or edge bevels.



The object has a matte mid-dark green-brown patina.



The length of the rapier measures 82.58mm, 31.03mm wide, 13.05mm thick at the rivets, 4.81mm thick at the blade break and together they weigh 35.3g. its maximum thickness is 6.8mm.

Metal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip (undertaken at the British Museum) indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94% gold and 6-8% silver, the rest (less than 1%) being copper. (See appended report).



Curators note: this is a very similar composition to the very similar band from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).



Discussion: Of Early Bronze Age date (c.2500 - 1500 BC), and now in two pieces, this is only the fifth or sixth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chacolithic period, c. 2500-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.

973517,Unidentified Object,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2500,-800,"An unidentified sheet-gold bag-shaped object, with one closed, rounded end and a narrower open end with a piercing to one face only (apparently). The object is perhaps of Bronze Age date (2,500-800 BC) and related to gold ornaments/ strips known from the Bronze Age of Southern England.

Both faces of the object retain traces of decoration in the form of numerous longitudinally-arranged raised ridges of rectangular section, parallel to each other. It isn't possible to determine what the reverse of the sheet-gold looks like.

To one edge of the object the sheet is unbroken/ undamaged on the rounded part, while the other edge is damaged. The narrower part above has jagged edges that are not joined.

The rounded end has a max.width of 10.4mm and a max.thickness of 2.1mm. The narrower strip above is max.6.8mm wide, narrowing to 4.8mm at the open end (both faces of the object are folded over at the very end). The piercing visible in one face only is 0.8mm in diameter and pierced from front to the reverse. It is possible there may be a matching piercing on the other face of the object and that this is now concealed by the fold.

The object measures 14.9mm in length, 10.4mm in max.width, 2.9mm in max.thickness (at the jagged edges of the narrower section) and weighs 0.76g.

973773,Spearhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,800,"A fragment of a cast copper alloy, Middle to Late Bronze Age (1500-800 BC) Socketed Spearhead.



Description: The spearhead is narrow and triangular with a pronounced mid rib on both sides extending to the tip of the spear which tapers into a blunt point. In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib, with multiple abrasions and missing portions along the edges. The fragment terminates in an old abraded, irregular transverse break, across the socket. The metal is pitted and corroded.



Measurements: length:43.87mm, width: 10.66mm, thickness: 7.48mm, weight.18g.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1500-c. 800 cal BC).

973831,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-1300,"An almost complete copper alloy unlooped palstave of Middle Bronze Age date (c. 1500-1300 BC) with shield shaped hollow below the stop ridge. Early or primary palstave of Group I - shield patterned type.



The palstave has a triangular shaped blade in plan. The palstave has a rectangular septum and straight-sided open flanges for hafting. The butt of the object is incomplete and measures 28.7 mm in width and 8.1 mm thick.



Beneath the stop-ridge descends a shield shaped hollow, this is visible but worn on both faces.



The blade of the palstave has expanding sides, and a convex cutting edge. The cutting edge is slightly asymmetrical and shows wear. The cutting edge measures 64.7 mm in width and is 9.6 mm thick.



The palstave is a mid green to brown colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of most of the original surface.



This form and style of palstave fits can be classified as an early palstave / primary group I - shield patterned and dates to the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age (MBA I) 1450-1250 BC specifically within the Acton Park II and Taunton metalworking assemblages (Needham Period 5) - both assemblages fit within Burgess Metal Working Stage VIII and IX. A close comparison to this palstave has been recorded from the Albrighton Area, Shropshire (HESH-D05FE3) and (WMID-755304) discovered in the Staffordshire Moorlands. Schmidt and Burgess (1981) have parallels for this type on plate 57.



Peter Reavill adds that the Palstave is heavier than normal, it was in this period that the makers were experimenting with adding more lead in to the composition. This was because by adding more lead it helped fill all corners of the mould.



Overall the palstave measures 152 mm in length, a maximum width of 64.7 mm at the cutting edge, and a maximum thickness near the stop ridge of 28.8 mm. It weighs 468.7 g.

974926,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1700,"Part of an undecorated flat axe of Early Bronze Age date (about 2200 - 1700 BC). Only the cutting blade end survives, probably less than half of the whole axehead. The axehead is 58mm long, 68.2mm wide tapering to 48.4mm, 11mm thick and weighs 216g.



The axe probably best fits within the Migdale metalworking tradition Type: Migdale - undecorated variant. These are dated to the Early Bronze Age (EBA phase II - VI), of metalworking stage IV-VI, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2-3 circa 2200 - 1700 CAL. BC.



The flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in plan with evenly expanding sides that extend to a splayed crescent shaped blade. The butt end is broken. In profile the axe is broadly lentoid with the blade end tapering. In cross section the axe is rectangular with all four faces only very slightly convex.



The sides of the axe gently expand evenly in width to a point just above the cutting edge where they become distinctly out-turned / splayed. The long edges of the axe have not been raised to form flanges; there is also no evidence of a median bevel (proto stop ridge) on either face of the axe. The tips of the blade are in good condition and there are indistinct blade facets on both faces of the cutting edge.



The axe has large patches of light green patina surviving, but is a red colour where the patina is missing. The surface is smooth and solid. Although there has been some surface loss there is no evidence of applied incised or hammered decoration. The break is patinated and irregular.

The palstave is near-complete, missing the loop but is heavily-corroded and is comparatively small (with a length of 108.6mm and a weight of 194.6g). The butt is straight, now worn to a slight angle (with a width of 18mm and a thickness of 5mm). The sides are near parallel, very gently convex (reaching a width of 23.5mm above the loop and a width of 20.8mm at the stop). The loop has been lost but the stubs indicate that it was positioned either side of the stop (with a length of 25mm and internal length of 9mm). The sides of the blade are gently curved and divergent, producing a moderately expanded blade edge with prominent curve (with a blade width of 37.4mm). The casting seams are raised and discernible on both sides but were neatly finished. The sides are appear to have been flat across the depths above the stop but convex on the blade. The flanges have been truncated but the better preserved flange appears to have been straight, gradually rising from the butt to the stop (with a maximum surviving thickness at the stop of 24.0mm. The stop has a gentle curve and near-vertical sides, perpendicular to the septum. The septum is moderately concave across its width and flat across its length. Both faces are ribbed, with a prominent midrib, flanked on each side with weaker ribs, positioned near but not at the sides. The ribs appear to have extended all the way along the blade to a blade facet. A single blade facet is evident on the blade. The surface is corroded but has mid to dark-green patina where it survives.



The palstave has a number of unusual features; Type Roundhay palstaves are generally smaller but this example is unusually small and also the three-rib decoration arrangement is difficult to parallel. The form is broadly consistent with Transitional Palstaves and specifically of Type Roundhay.

Discussion: A gold-plated lock ring of a similar style on the database (LANCUM-C2543F) that is Bronze Age in date was submitted for consideration as treasure (Treasure case tracking number: 2017T810) and includes the discussion: ‘This penannular ring belongs to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings' and 'ring-money' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008). Their function remains uncertain, although it is likely that they were personal adornments, possibly worn on the ears or nose, rather than being hair-ornaments or items of exchange. Relatively few examples have been dated through associated finds, archaeological investigation or radiocarbon dating, however burials in Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands and secondly, Scottish and Irish hoard associations, have suggested a date belonging to the Ewart Park phase of the Late Bronze Age, between 1000-800BC (e.g. Eogan 1997).



However, in recent years, the evidence for their earlier currency has been growing. A number of simple 'hair-rings' of solid gold rod construction have been found within a gold hoard near Cirencester (Needham 2007, 26-33, Figs. 17.3-4). These were directly associated with twisted torc and bracelet fragments also belonging to the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age. In Ireland, 'hair-rings' have been discovered at excavated sites at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow and Ballypriorbeg, Co. Tyrone have also recently been radiocarbon dated to 1290-1040 cal BC and 1373-1019 cal BC respectively (Dunne 2003; Suddaby 2003, 82-4, 88; Raftery 2004, 87-8). Therefore, on current evidence, the penannular ring may be dated to the Middle or Late Bronze Age (1300-800BC).



'Hair-rings' are discovered in significant numbers across Ireland and England, with approaching 130 known in Ireland (Raftery 2004, 87) and approaching 100 known in England, 40 new examples of which have been reported over the past ten years alone, usually by metal detectorists (O'Connor et al 2008; DCMS 2008, 21-2, Nos. 17-25; British Museum 2009, 50, Nos. 44-7). A significant scatter is known, especially from burials across Belgium, northeast France and The Netherlands (Eluère 1982, 52-3; Eogan 1997) with a small but growing number also from Scotland (O'Connor et al 2008). There are a number of examples known from Wales, Brynmill and Port Eynon, Swansea, 'Carmarthenshire', Ty Mawr, Anglesey and Graianog, Gwynedd (Gwilt 2000; 2004; 2009; Gwilt et al 2005, 40, Fig. 5, Nos. 2, 14 & 15).



LANCUM-C2543F is the first complete example from Cumbria and the only other complete example known from the North West is from Wrenbury practically on the Welsh border. There is another broken example from West Cumbria manufactured from gold sheet rolled into a tube with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the surface indicated a gold content of 80-82%, silver content of 14-15%, with at least 4% copper. The ring is formed from gold sheet rolled into a curved tube, with a single seam running along the inner edge of the ring. According to Gillian Varndell Curator, Department of Prehistory and Europe, British Museum. It is probably part of a well-known Bronze Age ornament type (composite ring) dating to c.1300-1100 BC. This find is also close to other gold finds from West Cumbria from a similar period consisting of a penannular bracelet and three lock rings. These finds are very significant for the North West in terms of high status Late Bronze Age activity.



The complex technology and compositions of a range of penannular rings within the British Museum collections has recently been studied in a systematic and considered manner (Meeks et al 2008). The St. Donats discovery appears to be most similar to their striped Group 3 examples, where silvery gold wire has been inlaid circumferentially into a gold core or gold foil. It most closely correlates with their Group 3d rings, defined as being gold foil plated copper alloy rings with silvery gold wire inlaid into the gold foil (Meeks et al 2008, 20 & Fig. 1x). However, closer comparison of the characteristics exhibited by examples from Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon, Brynmill and Graianog) suggests further variations, not entirely captured within the British Museum study sample. For example, the St. Donats and Port Eynon examples appear to have wider stripes and copper cores, rather than the narrow stripes and copper alloy cores of the closest British Museum parallels. The three penannular rings from south Wales (St. Donats, Port Eynon and Brynmill) appear to be closely similar in size and construction. All are small with diameters of 15.5-17.1mm, with gold foil over copper cores and similar weights of 6.85-7.31g. By comparison, the Graianog example, though striped, is slightly larger at 17-19mm diameter, thicker and appreciably heavier at 11.22g, while the gold foil is over a bronze rather than copper core. At the time of the reporting of the Port Eynon penannular ring, in 1999, analytical testing led to an interpretation of an electrum plated copper core, with a gold tape or foil wound spirally around the ring to give the striped effect (Northover unpublished; Gwilt 2000). The recent British Museum study is instead suggesting that strips of silvery gold were inlaid around a gold core or alternatively a base metal core covered in gold foil. Further consideration and analysis will be required, before the precise technique for the decoration on the St. Donats example can be absolutely confirmed.","As the object is over 300 years old and contains more than 10% precious metal, it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act.

The copper alloy spearhead consists of the upper portion of the spear, being broken above the socket. The tip is also damaged and abraded. In plan the spearhead is an elongated sub-triangle with the blade facets and tip all being abraded. The spear blades cutting edges have therefore been lost, however, the overall shape of the blade can be probably be ascribed to being leaf-shaped. The spearhead has a bi-convex shaped cross section.

It is likely that the style of this type of spearhead can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age; specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions. These phases correspond with Needham's Period 5 (c. 1500 - 1150 BC).

The palstave has a straight sided blade with the sides almost parallel and very little expansion towards the cutting edge which is 29 mm in width, with one corner of edge missing. There is a wide central rib on each face of the blade that is about 47 mm in length on both sides and 11 mm in width, just below the stop ridge, and tapers to 9 mm towards the end of blade. The base of the stop ridge remains on both sides, creating a T-shape in profile, so that the depth of the broken edge is 30 mm. On one side of the palstave the base of the side-loop survives below stop ridge, but the loop and its upper attachment are missing with the rest of the hafting end of the palstave, which would have held the handle. The surface of the blade is damaged, corroded and pitted and the original edge is missing down one side of the blade.

The terminal at the opposite end also narrows to a point and is intentionally cut in a straight diagonal on one edge. This terminal is also folded back on itself. As the object presents now both terminals bend in the same direction, but without the transverse bend of the object they would bend in opposite directions.

The object is the tip of a socketed spearhead, the blade is narrow and triangular with a pronounced mid rib on both sides extending to the tip of the spear which tapers in to a point. In cross section the object is lozenge shaped. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. There are multiple abrasions and missing portions of the edges. The fragment terminates in an old abraded transverse break. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing and the retained portions has a shallow concave aspect expose by the break.



The metal is a dark-green in colour with a pitted and corroded patina.



As this represents only a small fragment of the spear it is not possibly to classify the form of the complete object. It is probably of a later Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-c. 800 cal BC).

The palstave is missing its butt end which was hafted to the handle and likely broke at this point during use with the rest of the palstave still attached to the handle. The palstave has the remains of a rounded protruding stop ridge on both sides, 27 mm in total thickness, with recessed apertures within, 7 mm deep, which would have originally held the end of the haft or handle for the axehead. Below the stop ridge, which is 26 mm wide, the front and the back of the blade are recessed, 20 mm in thickness, and the sides are slightly inset and parallel to begin with, at 25 mm in width, but expand towards the cutting edge, 44 mm in width, to form a triangular-shaped blade in plan. The blade end is damaged and 9 mm in thickness, but there are no signs of it expanding to a crescentic edge. The surface of the blade is damaged and pitted but does not appear to have been decorated. The sides are also pitted and corroded but there is no evidence of the remains of the bottom of a side loop.



Knight, Ormrod & Pearce (2015) illustrate a slender palstave with no mouldings on the blade from the hoard of mainly shield-patterned palstaves found at St Tudy, Cornwall, on p.78, pl.5, no.78d.



Palstaves with shield-shaped decoration and expanded blades can be found during the Acton Park II metalwork phase (c.1500-1400 BC) of the Middle Bronze, such as the palstave illustrated in 'The Circulation of Metal in the British Bronze Age: The Application of Lead Isotope Analysis' (Rohl & Needham 1998, p.128, fig.29, no.96).



Schmidt & Burgess (1981) illustrate similar palstaves with low flanges, rounded stops and plain, triangular blades from the south of Scotland and Churwell, West Yorkshire in plate 61, nos.839 & 844, which are un-classified, but grouped with the South-western palstaves, and related to continental examples, respectively, but the latter is due to its decoration and not the form which is similar to this example.

983787,Blade,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1275,-1140,"Description: An incomplete cast copper-alloy rapier, in two intentionally broken sections, dating to the middle Bronze Age (c.1275-1140BC).



Both parts of the blade are broken at both ends; the breaks are abraded and old. One section blade tapers to a broken tip with broadly parallel edges. The other section is wider and bent at one end. Each has a tapered cutting edge on both sides. There is a flattened central rib on both faces the length of the blade, measuring approximately 9.81mm, giving a shallow lentoid cross section. Examination of the break sections, particularly the break at which the two sections join, show casting flaws in the form of hollows (or bubbles). 



The blade has a patchy green brown patina.



Dimensions: One section measures 128.35mm in length, is 17.70mm wide, 4.81mm thick and weighs 52.2g. The other is 101.45mm long, tapers from 17.37mm to 10.29mm in width, is 4.86mm thick and weighs 28.5g.



Discussion: The blade is comparable in some respects to Bronze Age blades, such as those described BERK-227481 and KENT-FE8716, but the central ridge on this find seems less prominent and the blade is thicker throughout. The bend and break shows similarities to rapier DOR-2A928E, which was also broken in antiquity prior to deposition. Following the blade cross-section scheme of classification set out by Burgess & Gerloff 1981 (in O'Connor et al. 1995, 347)  the blade under discussion here (2020-T354 / DUR-7A57CC) is a Group IV rapier, with slightly rounded cross-section characteristic of the Penard phase of the Middle Bronze Age ""with a floruit around the 13th/12th centuries cal BC (c.1275-1140BC)

984922,Bracelet,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1150,-800,"A fragment of a gold penannular bracelet of Late Bronze Age date (1150-800 BC). The object is circular sectioned and slightly curved in plan with transverse cuts at both ends. One of the cuts in not clean and the object appears to have ben initially cut, with the remaining 50% of the bar being broken off. There are some minor shallow gouges in the surface of the object. 



Length: 58.42mm, Diameter: 5.02mm, Weight: 17.0g 



The original form would likely have been similar to LEIC-A3A9AE.



Several similar fragments of goldwork have been recovered from hoards containing diagnostically Bronze Age objects (e.g. Poulton, Gloucestershire: Treasure case 2004 T17 and the Fitzleroi Farm, West Sussex, hoard: BM accession nos. 1996, 0902.1-42). Those hoards, and several others recorded in recent years, contain fragments of gold that has been snipped with a pincer like instrument, similar to the Calbourne fragment. The shape of the terminal is relatively universal but can be compared to other round section bar bracelets of Bronze Age date (e.g, with 2011 T926 (CAM-08B4E0) cf. Taylor 1980. Furthermore, the composition of the gold does not disagree with a Later Bronze Age date.

986501,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2200,-1800,"A fragment of a copper alloy Flat Axe of Early Bronze Age date (2200-1800 BC). The object is a fragment of an uncertain type of Flat or Developed Axe form. The object is composed of the butt end which is broken toward the blade end by an old, abraded and irregular break. The retained butt end is abraded but is rectangular in plan and section and tapers out toward the body of the object both in plan and section.  The sides are straight and slightly divergent for their short lengths to the break. There is no indication of flanges retained within the fragment.



The fragmentary nature of the axe makes typological identification difficult. The butt form, absence of flanges and the presumed bronze composition would be consistent with axes of Needham's type 3 and in relation to Schmidt and Burgess (1981) typology may have been of Migdale, Aylesford or allied types.

The blade is narrow and sub-triangular with a pronounced mid rib on both sides extending to both ends of the spear. In cross section the object is lozenge. The edges narrow and flare out from the mid-rib. All of the edges are broken and abraded. The fragment terminates in an old abraded transverse break at both ends. The socketed lower portion of the object is missing.

Description: The body of the hammer has been relatively crudely finished with the casting seems very prominent and unworn.  The socket is sub-square in cross-section at the mouth with a double moulding on the exterior. The main body of the hammer is narrow below the moulded collar and flares slightly to the working face. The face and body are as one unlike modern hammers so the bell/poll is from the socket to the working face. The face has a convex surface and is a rounded square in plan, with convex sides and smooth, rounded edges. The face is relatively smooth and its edges are marked by a range of numerous irregular and differently aligned indentations, some of which could be recent agricultural damage, but most of which are probably use wear.



The surface condition of the hammer is good, though there are several patches of surface loss where pale green corrosive products are visible. Otherwise the surface is patinated dark green.



Measurements:  55.16mm in length, 31.38mm wide, at the bell/poll; 29.75mm thick, and weight of 166.75g in weight.



Discussion: Socketed hammers are a rare find, especially when compared to socketed axeheads with, at the date of writing less than 60 examples reported to the PAS Database and only a small number of examples found in Kent;  KENT-FDBC44 and another in Crundale Hoard KENT-7C3863. The Bronze Age Guide on the PAS website comments that the ""socketed (hammers are) only rarely found in Middle Bronze Age contexts and is a more defined feature of Late Bronze Age hoards. Rowlands (1976: 45) states that, for this very reason, 'it would be unwise to date stray finds to the MBA' With regard to decoration, they are found with or without a single rib band, and in the case of a few hoards in Brittany, some hammers were found with chevron decoration."" Another example on the PAS database with decoration similar to this example is NMGW-475C27.



The YORYM-ABCCE1 record for another hammer discusses the dating of socketed hammers stating that 'early examples tend to be plain with no collar, whereas later examples have collars and moulding'. with this in mind this example appears to date to the Late Bronze Age.

Previously very few had been recorded, but metal detecting has increased the number slowly over the years, once they were thought to be of Early Bronze Age date as a straight evolution from the flint barbed and tanged arrowheads. Another theory was that these could have come from abroad but no parallel has been noted from the continent of this distinct form, though there are variations on the barbed and tanged type.

Description: The axehead has a narrow sub-rectangular body, slightly narrower in the middle, with two concave faces flaring towards the blade end and slightly towards the haft end. In plan the blade remains very narrow for the type and the flaring a crescentic cutting edge appears to have been worn down. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners . It has a raised double collar, the outer band of whcih is mostly worn or broken away, what remains is obscured by wear and corrosion as is the lower band. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have been worked down either through hammering or filing/polishing, particularly towards the blade end perhaps suggesting extensive sharpening of the blade, perhaps indicating why the blade is so short. Part of side of the axehead is broken away and the axe has some advanced corrosion particularly towards the butt end of one of the faces. It has a more even patination towards the blade edge.

Description: The fragment represents part of the blade end of the long rectangular socketed body of the axehead. No edge remains in tact so over all shape is based on known more complete examples. The blade runs in a very shallow convex curve and is heavily abraded, the blade tips likely flared slightly outwards. The surviving cross section of the socket is sub-oval. The remaining body appears to be undecorated although with such little remaining it is not possible to be sure although the casting seam is clearly visible . The axehead is patinated a mottled mid-light green and the breaks have led to more extensive corrosion and most surfaces are heavily pitted.

989237,Casting Waste,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,ROMAN,-1550,450,"A fragment of copper alloy casting waste, probably a jet or mould, probably dating from the late Bronze Age but possibly dating from as late as the Roman period, c. 1500 BC to 450 AD.



The object is formed of a thick central bar which isbroadly rectilinear in plann, but which rises to an off centre ridge. At each end of the central bar, the object flares outwards creating two loosely triangular terminals. These are the result of two circular apertures, of different sizes, which give the impression of an overall hourglass shape. The larger of these is 35mm in width and the smaller is 25.4mm in width. The central bar narrows on the reverse, tapering from 13.7mm wide and ending as a slender rectilinear base of 7mm in width.The upper surface, while pitted and marked, is relatively regular, while on the reverse, there are depressions which hollow out a flaring rectilinear shape in the centre, and a further less regularly shaped semi triangular depression on the underside of the upper wide area. 



Casting waste is difficult to date in isolation but the patina and form are suggestive of a Bronze Age - Roman date.  The survival of casting waste is relatively rare as it is usually recycled swiftly as a bi-product of casting. The depressions are likely to have been caused by the product moulded cooling and contracting during casting (Reavill pers.comm). Like the first of the named examples below, it may have been from the neck (funnel / well) of a composite probably two part mould.

989779,Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,IRON AGE,-800,-700,"An incomplete copper-alloy looped, socketed axehead dating from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age c. 800 - 700 BC. The mouth of the axe-head has a prominent collar and indicates a rectangular shape with rounded edges, however only half the mouth remains, in addition to the single loop. To the side of the loop runs a longitudinal ridge with a darker green fill; this appears to be a casting fault, and a possible attempt at fixing the break: though this appears to be an old mend, it has not been established whether or not this feature is the result of recent intervention. With the exception of the collar, the edges of the highly fragmentary axehead are worn and all demonstrate an even, green patina, suggesting the breaks are old. Worn ridges on the surface of the front of the axehead suggest there may originally have been one or several ribs running from the collar towards the (now missing) blade.

990381,Flat Axehead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-2350,-2050,"A complete copper alloy flat axehead, probably dating from the Early Bronze Age period (c. BC 2350 - c. BC 2050). 

The axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid.

The sides of the axe gently taper outwards with a shallow curve, from the rounded butt to the blade. The curve is less shallow towards the blade. The axehead has suffered significant loss from corrosion on all surfaces, particularly at the blade and the butt.

The axehead measures 67.4 mm in length, the butt is 18.1 mm wide and the blade measures 27.3 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.8 mm, the ridge measures 10.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 59 g.



The axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).



These axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

991249,Ribbon,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1500,-800,"An incomplete strip of decorated gold, of probable Bronze Age dating (c. 1500 BC to c. 800 BC).



The strip of gold is sub rectangular in shape and has been folded into a sub triangular shape. The strip has been decorated with a series of embossed ridges along its length. One end has a relatively straight and smooth cut edge, the other end is hidden inside the folds. 



It measures 13.2 mm in length, 4.4. mm wide and 4.0 mm thick. It weighs 1.1 g.



Similar strips of gold with ribbed decoration have been recorded on the PASdatabase including WMID-fe3c28, ESS-C13B97, SUR-1B64F5, NMS-46A4D6, PAS-E9E2A1, SF-D30D10, LIN-946F12 and WAW-052196.



Similar multi-grooved strips of a Bronze Age date are known from throughout Britain including in the British Museum collection from Flixton, Yorkshire (2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16. no. 2) and Ravencliff Cave, Derbyshire (British Museum 1906,1224.1-2) as well as recent finds such as Ansley, Warwickshire and West Acre Norfolk (Treasure Annual Report 2007, 47-48). A very similar strip from Sproxton, North Yorkshire is recorded on the PAS database as LVPL-83FE92. There is also a similar grooved strip from The Hamel, Oxford, Oxfordshire excavated from a layer which yielded Beaker pottery of the Early Bronze Age (Palmer 1980, 124-134). Similar narrow embossed strips are known from the pommels of daggers accompanying Early Bronze Age burials in Scotland (Henshall 1968, 173-95; Hardaker 1974, 21-23. fig 6.; Taylor 1980, fig 28a-f) but not however comparable to gold dagger fittings in contemporary burials southern England. Other Bronze Age gold strips found singly such as at Flixton, Yorkshire (British Museum 2004,0904.1a-b, Treasure Annual Report 2003, 16, no. 2) are broader and have more and narrower incised grooves. The annular ring from the Late Bronze Age hoard at Abia de la Obispalia, central Spain is comparable in form and dimensions but the grooves appear to have been incised rather than embossed (Almagro Gorbea 1974). Similarly, the Bronze Age annular ring from Armissan, southeast France may be comparable (Eluère 1981, 48-49, fig. 55).



As this fragment is older than 300 years in age, with a precious metal content of greater than 10%, it should be considered as potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.

991872,Palstave,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,-1100,-900,"An incomplete Middle to Late Bronze Age palstave axehead of Transitional or Late type, dating to the Penard or Wilburton phase (MBA III to LBA I; 1100 - 900 BC). Almost the entire butt end is missing (old break), making it difficult to determine its original length. It has the remains of one side loop (old break).

The long edges of the blade flare gently in a straight line, subtly expanding just above the curved cutting edge which has suffered some damage (now worn but leaving indents along the edge). The blade is 27.7mm wide just below the loop and increases to a width of 41.8mm at the cutting edge. Just above the loop is the stop ridge, deeper than it is wide (27.8mm wide x 33.7mm deep). From this and extending longitudinally at the centre of both faces, is a ridge-like moulding (rather than a defined mid-rib), which shallows-out towards the cutting edge.

The remains of the loop measure 10.6mm in length, 7.0mm in width and 8.2mm in thickness. It is oval in cross-section. Extending from the base of the loop to the cutting edge and slightly more towards one face than the other is the remains of a worn casting flash. This is also apparent to the opposite side of the axehead, again leaning slightly more to one face than the other.

The stop ridge is convex to front and back while its side edges are straight; in cross-section it forms an 'H'. The depth between ridge and face of the butt end is 10.8mm to one side and 12.8mm to the other. The flanges are of uneven thicknesses: with the loop facing left and looking at the stop ridge from above (in cross-section) the flange on the bottom right measures 5.9mm, the top right measures 4.5mm, the bottom left measures 5.1mm and the top left is missing. The remains of the face measures 9.7mm thick and c.6mm in length.

The cutting edge is crescent shaped, the blade flares out to the tips. The casting seams on the sides of the axehead have not been worked down and remain fairly prominent, there is little sign of overall wear on the blade. The body is sub rectangular in section, as is the internal socket end. The whole object has a well formed, dark brown patina. Although it is difficult to determine from a fragment, the axehead  probably fits into the Ewart park or Wilburton metal working groups, giving it a date of 1100-800 BC (Schmidt & Burgess 1981: 119).

The axehead consists of part of the hollowed blade. It appears truncated, so that a portion of blade and socket are missing. The blade itself is markedly thicker on the upper surface (8.53mm) than the lower surface (2.50mm), but both share the same profile, flaring from the rectangular socket to form a wider cutting edge. There are some signs of unfinished seams on the side surfaces. It is now a greenish patina with a notable area of damage in different places on both sides- diagonally across the blade and at the lower edge of the blade and side piece. 



The axehead is slightly reminiscent but neater and better produced than no. 176 in Pearce (1983: 431), which she describes as being from the Ashburton area. WILT-A8FADF is a closer example.

The blade is incised on both faces with a pair of parallel longitudinal grooves, approximately 4.7mm in from the edge, at the junction of the oval-section midrib and the bevelled blade edges. The grooves taper as the blade edge does, towards the rounded broken edge, which is not the tip of the blade. The grooves border a central raised mid-rib which is 14 mm wide and 6 mm thick, measuring both faces of the blade together, but more pitted on one side. The wider broken end appears to have been deliberately  and cleanly cut perpendicular to the edge which is commonly seen in the breaking up of swords into fragments for deposition (Matt Knight pers comm).

Description: A group of four fragments of a range of objects, dating from the early to late Bronze Age (2350-800 BC).



1 Middle Bronze Age date (1500- 1100 BC).



2 Middle Bronze Age date from the period (1500- 1100 BC).



3 Early to Middle Bronze Age date from the period (2350-1500 BC). 



4 Mid to Late Bronze Age date (1600-800 BC).



1 An incomplete copper alloy Palstave The object is a slender palstave. The cutting edge has a crescentic form with slightly flared tips. The edge is missing portions of side due to post-depositional processes. There is a stopridge a little under halfway down the palstave. The stopridge is flush with the flange. The integral loop is centred just before the stopridge. There is a beak at the apex of the loop resulting in the loss of a small portion and the break is abraded. The flange ends at the stopridge resulting in a shield shape. Portions of the outer edges of both flange are missing due to post-depositional processes. The flanges and septum form an H shape. There is a slight central raised mid-rib, extending from the stopridge to the cutting end on both sides. The object retains casting seams around the upper and lower edges. The butt edge is irregular in plan. The metal has a dark greenish brown, slightly pitted patina.  



Late/transitional palstave possibly of the Wilburton/Penard Phase.



2 An incomplete copper alloy Palstave The object is a slender palstave. The cutting edge has a crescentic form with slightly flared tips. The edge is missing portions of side due to post-depositional processes. There is a stopridge a little under halfway down the palstave. The stopridge is flush with the flange. The integral loop is centred just before the stopridge. The flange ends at the stopridge resulting in a shield shape. Portions of the outer edges of both flange are missing due to post-depositional processes. The flanges and septum form a U-shaped septum and straight-sided open flanges. There is a pronounced central raised mid-rib, extending from the stopridge to the cutting end on both sides, which expands and becomes more shallow towards the cutting edge. There is a semi-circular void in the centre of the butt end. The object retains casting seams around the upper and lower edges. The metal has a dark green, slightly pitted patina. 



Late/transitional palstave possibly of the Wilburton/Penard Phase.



3 A fragment of a copper alloy Flat Axehead. The retained portion is the cutting edge of a flat axehead, it is solid cast and the object flares out to the sides towards the butt end creating a wedge shape. The sides of the cutting edge are flared and the cutting edge tapers in to form a bevelled cutting edge. There is a casting seam visible on the upper and lower edges. The object terminates in a transverse break resulting in the loss of approximately 60% of the original form.  



4 A fragment of a copper alloy Blade, Dagger or Rapier. The object is rectangular in plan and ovate in cross section. It is incomplete being broken transversely on the upper and lower edges. There is visible bevelling along the left and right hand edges away from the mid-ribs. The central portion of the blade retains two longitudinal mid-ribs. The metal a dark green predominantly smooth patina.



Discussion: It is not possible to assign the more fragmentary pieces (no’s 3-4) to a particular typological grouping due to their fragmentary nature, however they fit within similar groups of middle to late Bronze Age hoards using those diagnostic features which are retained. The more complete objects (1-2) fit within the Wilburton/Penard Phase of Late/transitional middle Bronze Age date.

There seems to be some evidence of a sharpened blade edge but not clear bevel and this is mostly lost to chipping.  The blade measures 62.7mm in length,21.6mm maximum width. The edge of the blade is 0.9mm thick, tapering to a maximum thickness of 2.8mm by the midrib. The centre of the blade is divided by a tapering lozenge shaped midrib which expands from a thickness of 2.7mm at the tip to 9.3mm at the base of the head.



The socket is oval in cross section at the top wider in line with the midrib, narrower in plane with the blade) 10.9mm by 9.3mm. It becomes circular in shape by the base where it measures 18.7mm in diameter. The mouth of the socket  has an old break to one side. The socket is at least 24.8mm deep but contains dry, copper stained material so was originally deeper. This is dust with no fibrous properties remaining but could be the remains of the wooden haft, or of later mud.



The loops are positioned on either side of the socket, about half way down, approximately opposite one another. The loops are curved, more elongated than a semi-circle and have slightly widened outer edges into slight loop plates . The loops measure 11mm in length, 3.5-4mm in width at the base, 4-4.5, at the centre and project 4.5-4.7mmmm from the outside of the socket. The holes are now filled with corrosion. Casting ribs are visible running along both sides of the body from the mouth to the point at which the blade commences.



The spearhead has a mottled dark green patina and the surface is heavily pitted.



HESH-CFC925, WAW-DC8222, HESH-CE6980 and SWYOR-BF67A6 are similar examples on the database. The record for the former states that: similar side looped spearheads have been classified by Margaret Ehrenberg as Class IV dated to the Middle Bronze Age specifically the second phase of Acton Park (2), Taunton (Cemmaes) or Pennard metalworking traditions.

The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. A small lip runs around the edge of the socket and there is a collar of similar width around the narrowest part of the axe. The axe is otherwise undecorated. Both sides of the axe have a pronounced casting seam running along their centre. There is a loop on one side of the axe, joining next to the collar and extending to about halfway along the blade.

2.    Complete cast copper alloy socketed axe head. The axe is relatively long. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. It has a subrectangular body, narrowest in the middle, flaring wider towards the socket and widest at the cutting edge. The socket of the axehead is sub-rectangular with curving corners. There is a double raised collar at the socket end. The axe is otherwise undecorated. Both sides of the axe have a pronounced casting seam running along their centre.

Discussion: 1. Is Type Portree (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, esp nos. 1043 and 1051). 2. Is a socketed axe of Type Wilburton (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, nos. 1007-1009). They both date from the earlier Late Bronze Age, c. 1125-900BC. The two axes are contemporary, which fits with them having been deliberately deposited together as a hoard. A similar combination of types can be seen in the hoard from Lowthorpe ER Yorkshire (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, Plate 139E).

995858,Arrowhead,Bronze Age,Bronze Age,BRONZE AGE,1000,800,"an incomplete copper alloy late Bronze Age socketed arrowhead or small spearhead, dated to the late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 800 BC).



A cast bronze arrowhead, possibly dating to the late Bronze Age between c. 1000-800 BC (length: 48.48mm; width: 9.14mm; thickness: 8.4mm; diameter of socket: 4.76mm; weight: 9.8g). The arrowhead flares out gently from the base and narrows towards the tip forming a ""leaf-shape"" when viewed in plan.  On both the face and reverse, a central rib extends from the base towards the tip, although its presence is uncertain at the tip due to material loss. The metal narrows to form lateral blades either side of the central rib, although the edges of the blades are missing, making the original shape uncertain. The tip is missing, leaving a rough, rounded end to the object.  The base includes a circular blind socket which extends about 15mm into the object. The arrowhead appears to be solid. 



The metal surface is mostly dark green with some small raised patches of mid-brown material which are likely to be soil or a corrosion product or a coating.  A large proportion of the surface is smooth, appearing to be original, but approximately 20% of this surface has been lost to corrosion or physical damage, leaving a rough surface.  The base is broken through the socket so it is likely that part of the length is missing. The break surface is rough and has a similar green surface patina to the rest of the object. The break reveals the roughness of the casting, with two sub-spherical cavities in the region of the junction of the blades with the material surrounding the socket, which are probably bubbles from casting process.

 



WMID-28FC66 describes a similar object and states that ""Bronze arrowheads dating to this period are extremely rare in Britain, with one found as part of a hoard in Penard, Wales (Savory, 1980, 57) as well as possible arrowheads found on the Isle of Portland, Sussex, Yorkshire, Montgomeryshire and another on display in Norwich Museum. Bronze arrowheads seem to appear more regularly in France where they were first manufactured in the Middle Bronze Age, in the Paris basin and the west-central area (Savory, 57).""



Similar objects are described in SUSS-5DC319, SWYOR-19E2B1, SWYOR-C57356 and WMID-3AE711.  These appear to mostly date to the late Bronze Age.  Although arrowheads are described as very rare finds, this example does appear to be very small for a spearhead.  Although the edges, base and tip are missing and therefore original size cannot be determined, the shape appears to taper inward towards the base and so it is unlikely that the socket diameter is much bigger than the 4.76mm measured.  This indicates that the shaft of the original weapon would be narrow and relatively weak for a spear, unless made for a child or ceremonial purpose.","This object was partly recorded during the Covid19 crisis.
